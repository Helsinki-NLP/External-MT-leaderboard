This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has already been popular in scientific circles, but also provides information that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and 3D texture.
Scientists say the animal's ornamental feathers were king oak brown at the top and carotenoid at the bottom.
This finding also increases our understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because this dinosaur's feathers lacked a well-developed bar called the trunk, but had other feather features - beard and fine hair - researchers argue that the evolution of the trunk probably took place later than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but were used to regulate temperature or display. Researchers believe that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen still represents an adult animal feather rather than the tail of a chicken.
The researchers said that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it still represents the plumage of an adult animal, not the tail of a chicken.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the arc galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the wave forces between the dark matter of the Milky Way and the galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on the Earth, causing waves, so does the Milky Way exert gravitational pull on the arc galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.

In France, voting has traditionally been done with primitive technology: voters would sit in individual boxes and place a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope representing their chosen candidate.
Once the authorities have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter puts the ballot paper into the ballot box and enters his signature on the ballot.
The French electoral law sets relatively strict rules for these procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there is no envelope at the beginning of the vote and no envelope is added except for the envelope of the authorized voter.
Candidates can send representatives to observe any part of the process. At night, votes are counted by following specific procedures, by volunteers and under strict supervision.

He is in custody awaiting sentencing and trial, but any eyewitness may be impressed as his image is widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish courts operate differently and have found the publication of images to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says: "It seems that journalists are stepping on the line if they publish photos etc. of suspects".
The Scottish Court, which is responsible for the whole of the case, told reporters that no further explanation would be given, at least until the conviction was announced.
The document is based on the leak and relates to a border dispute, where the Palestinians demanded a border as it was before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other reported topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, as well as the issue of Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded a continuous military presence in the Valley for 10 years since the agreement was signed, while parliament has agreed to a five-year period.
The shooters participating in the complementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forestry professionals as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Australian Shooters Association (NSW), eligible volunteers were recruited under the Shooters Association Hunt program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Park and Heritage Conservation Director with NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday at the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former interim electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasional violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections that were scheduled to be held in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of iPads have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 extreme warming events, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry in a statement called Apple's delay in reporting "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 am local time (9:19 pm Greenwich time on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reported injuries in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, as well as Filipino officials, were initially released.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began her career at the Auckland National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began her research on preterm birth in her spare time.
His research showed that if hormones were given, the fetal lung maturation would accelerate.
The state-run Xinhua news agency reported that government inspectors recovered two flight reports from the black box on Wednesday.
The fellow captains also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Lona was the first Extreme queen. My first manager.
Dustin W.G.Ronalds said, "Lona was as temperamental as I was, maybe more so, I loved her but I left her, and I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
At the end of the poll, 29% of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed Australia should never become a republic.
He was an Olympic gold medallist in the 100m, 200m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaint, there were doubts about his fitness for the competition.
He has not been able to get the medication he needs to manage his pain because these medications are banned.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are likely the source of Earth's water supply and organic matter that could support proteins and life.
Scientists hope to figure out how planets form, particularly how Earth formed after cometary collisions in distant times.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and passed a bill legalizing gay marriage later this month.
He called the rumors "political nonsense".
He is projected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) claims that the NextGen system enables aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology versus ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to track aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional vehicles are allowed to enter and no surface trains will stop at Wembley and no parking facilities are available for playgrounds.
Fear of lack of transportation increased the likelihood that they might have to play the game behind closed doors and without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported new species evolving in just two generations, although it was believed that the process took much longer because of the interbreeding between a native Darwinian grassland, a medium-sized terrestrial grassland, and a migratory cactus grassland, the Great Cactus Grassland.
Gold can be made in many different shapes. It can be made into very fine rings.
It can be drawn in thin wire that can be twisted and twisted together. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and put in another metal, and it can be made so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "Tathāhib".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The water of the capsule will change color due to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which an electron is taken (as hydrogen atoms are made up of only one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders and then press them with dry, clean hands into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels interesting and forms a kind of shell.
Almost every home in Harapa and Mohenjo-Daro has a toilet equipped with a flash tank connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in the homes of the Minoan and Santorini towns in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Iran and China, toilets were also used. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women attended in groups and mixed.
When you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away from you, you're using satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and reflects it down almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
To put a satellite or telescope in space, you need a large rocket over 100 feet high.
The revolution that the wheel has created in the world is incredible. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
The wheel has brought us trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below this group are the more moderate-bodied Sanani cats, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to mountain goats and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including lazy domestic cats) that eat a large number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the Knam, the special work that each San cat does to keep it out of competition with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called herds.
The hybrids consist of one to three mated adult males with 30 females and young.
Women are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave very much like wolves or dogs, animals that behave in a surprisingly similar way to lions (but not other big cats), and are very lethal to their prey.
Like a six-legged athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well at this), swim, walk long distances, and hit something five times as hard as a strong human.
The tiger is also placed in the same genus as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four are the only species of cat that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not the full sound of a lion's roar, but more like a sentence of roaring words.
Leopards like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that a leopard hunts are much smaller than its body.
Scientists think that the American Trail Leopard tracks animals by sense of smell and finds prey to eat, and by sniffing, it tracks their footprints on the ground.
They can see well in the dark because of their night vision, and they move very quietly. To hunt prey, the ocelot first masquerades in the surrounding environment and then suddenly dives into the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small community) separates from the original community to which it belongs (as when they move across a mountain range or river, or when they go to a new island where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different capabilities or adaptations to be a strong competitor, in addition to what they already needed.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need to adapt to the environment.
Over time, as their new population adapts to their new environment, they become less and less like other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans emit.
Plants get their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaur was the greatest hunter of his time, so he was not afraid of anything but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We're not sure, but it may have had a tongue of a duckling, and its diet included turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been homosexual.
It also attacks anything that gets into the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus would not be different.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of exotic and unusual items including wild deer, peacocks, snails and a species of rodent called the winter sleeper mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat in their chairs and ate their meals, the rich men liked to party together and have fun while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include the foods that were brought in centuries later from the Americas and Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was the house of the god.
People had to sacrifice to the gods, and priests had to try to meet the needs of the gods during ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open courtyard followed by an inner temple, which only the clergy could enter.
Sometimes pyramidal towers were built in a special shape, called a zigurat, as part of a temple.
The tower was the sanctuary of God.
In the hot Middle Eastern climate, home didn't matter much.
This Jewish family spent most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were playstands overlooking the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was gradually settled. In Norse mythology, Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and found Greenland while traveling westward, and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimos were still living there at the time.
Although all countries were Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Anthem", you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that this large, handwritten document was hung for storage early in its life, measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches.
So, it's possible that the note was merely attached as a label.
The landings on the opening day of the invasion and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French, the Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion known as Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had managed to liberate southern France and divert their advance towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture maintained by a very large group of people, a society, who live and work together.
The word civilization derives from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning urban, and civitas, meaning urban, and also defines to some extent the size of society.
A civilized culture refers to the transfer of knowledge across generations, a long cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Microcultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and cannot be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government under the principles of confederation - with Congress as its sole component.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, as there was no national executive or judiciary, and relied on government officials, who often did not cooperate, to carry out all their actions.
There was also no reference to abolishing tax laws and tariffs between countries.
Before the amendment, it was necessary to obtain the unanimous consent of all states and the states had to obtain the positive opinion of their central government even in the absence of a representative.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Common sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "Algerian complex" in terms of its geographical location.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through named the island Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a revolution in indigenous grain production operations and employing Chinese workers to work on its sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of the western and northern areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan as one of the provinces of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which held the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Many of the outlying buildings have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, it's got its image ratio from digital camera image sensor formats.
Actually, the 35mm format is a little bit confusing, and it's 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (which we divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio with the integers) is expressed as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family formats) have this aspect ratio equal to or very close to it.
The very annoying and ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guide to creating dynamics while maintaining order in an image.
states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three vertical and horizontal images (see for example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the core beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds were created for exactly that.
The central power of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has served its purpose.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated the entire international law accepted by several international treaties over the past two centuries, it proved to be an effective strategy to cut off vital military and civilian resources.
The UK mines international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire parts of the ocean and even threatens neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unconditional submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude in most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After seeing the horrors of war during World War I, nations resolved to prevent a recurrence of this situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to New York City in the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company.
He entered Thomas Edison, USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry and a recommendation letter from Charles Bachler (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each time period of China or each dynasty that held power was a distinct dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between each dynasty, when provinces were divided. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time, fierce battles were fought between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, in which thousands of people died trying to occupy the highest seat in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences including the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, post-revolutionary jobs were open to all male applicants, making it possible for more ambitious and successful people to succeed.
The same was true for the military, because instead of ranking the army by rank, it was now ranked by ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to go to a cave called Hira on Mount Noor to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, reflects a very clear vision of the spiritual tendencies of Muhammad.
This cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knew that such a thing existed, finding it would be a daunting task.
Nothing but a clear, beautiful sky above and many mountains surrounding it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only survivor of the Seven Wonders still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Pyramid Complex in Egypt's Valley of the Dead consists of several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest) and several smaller tombs, several temples and a large statue of Abu Hurayrah.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward-facing symbol is a V, and the downward-facing symbol is a manganese or a square without end.
So you start at the top and pull the arrow, and you start at the bottom, which is where the arrow is held by the hand, and you pull the arrow forward.
Usually, pulling the bridle towards the violin's handle creates a softer sound, while the opposite movement is stronger and tighter.
Feel free to draw your own marks with pencil, but remember that printed chalk marks have a musical aspect to them, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified Queen Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Therese, 11, and Louis Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a mob shouting at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave their carriage windows wide open.
It is said that one of the members of the crowd shook the head of one of the royal guards killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The cost of the US imperialist war in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay their taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for the bulk of the costs and profits of the government's floating bonds in the name of the Philippines through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the tremendous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people are the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which these events occurred is generally called the Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was formed after the Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by the Convention around 1500.
Algebraic technology is a term that actually encompasses a range of ideas, from technological pressure or technological necessity to the strict sense of the word that the fundamental logic of scientific laws and their emergence in technology governs human destiny.
Most interpretations of technological algebra share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself pursues a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has more "impacts" on inherent societies than on conditional societies.
For example, someone might say that the car necessarily led to the development of roads.
But a global road network for a small number of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods were expanded to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The common ownership of cars also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new methods in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a huge element of cultural algebra that originated from authors like Gotye, Fichte and Ashleigh.
In the Romantic text, geography shaped people and over time the customs and culture associated with that geography evolved, and these were in harmony with the status of society, which was better than the rules that were imposed by the autocracy.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of the nobility began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its position was weakened as the Crusaders turned to gifts such as silk and spices, which were worth more than the supply of the Eastern Roman market.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was mainly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, styles in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop fashion. One of the biggest developments of the time was the Crusades, and people started using buttons to tie their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to produce enough food just to provide for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the bioregions along with rotational cultivation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers lived off agriculture, and this still exists in many developing countries.
Micro-cultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's standards and give them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Microcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, place of residence and/or gender.
Traits that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, ambience, and deliberate speech.
One of the most common ways to describe the importance of sociability is to seek help from the regrettable cases of children who did not learn sociability during their development due to neglect, neglect, or deliberate exposure from adults.
Some of these feral children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the release of the child is due to the parents' denial of the child's severe mental and physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe pain or emotional trauma before being abandoned or escaped.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child will exhibit behaviors (in the physical range) almost like animal behavior, such as fear and indifference toward humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scraping goes a step further.
Stacking is not a method of learning but an aid that supports people who are getting a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words a teacher is a kind of scaffolding but the small paper clip is also a scaffolding in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in software and aims to question, provoke, and explain methods that might be challenging for students to do alone.
Children are placed in nursing homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to even neglect.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that lacks nutrition, care and education, but it happens.
We see the child care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our care system strives to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, sustainable education and reliable health care.
Adoption requires that all the needs of the adopted child are met in the previous home from which the child was brought.
The Internet combines elements of collective and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usability and satisfaction approach.
For example, "memory" and "sociability" are cited as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal conflict" and "permanent relationships" were also identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they were researching audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the field of micro-expression and facial movements, which take only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting small statements, it is possible to tell if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", showed how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior could be common in animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research showed that there are two sources of genetic change: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic diversity and remove selection from the pool of expressed diversity.
The separation and reassembly of the two pools pushes the difference back and forth with each generation.
Outside the savannah, meeting the amino acid-based needs of available plant sources has been difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system.
After all, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant sources are proteins found in leaves and seeds, but these are hard for mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality protein containing all essential amino acids.
Everything is taken into account, and if our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today, we shouldn't be surprised.
Sleep disorder is the process of conscious awakening during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you find that you turn off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a particular diuretic) before bedtime, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calmness of a person is inversely related to the degree of tension in the body and mind of the person.
The less stress, the more positive the gift of life force.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was extended through the love of Mahayana and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically very simple, and it includes the Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that is all-encompassing.
Using Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga movements, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods. Through the visualization of various gods, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States. By the end of the war, differences in system, process, and culture led to the separation of the two countries.
By the last two years of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years, fighting with proxy armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places in real life.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish national defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Serpentine.
But these plans were thwarted almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods through the ocean.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to make sure your country has the ability to move your people and your goods, while also interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One example worth mentioning was the battle in the North Atlantic during World War II, when Americans tried to get people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy tried to block the passage, mainly using U-boats.
If Germany had defeated the Allies, she might have won over Britain because she had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds on hillsides or other areas of grassland, often tended by shepherds, often children and teenagers, similar to ordinary shepherds.
The wagon line was built in 16th century England.
Although wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than pulling on the rougher roads of the time.
Rail was introduced almost from the beginning to keep trains in place. However, gradually, it was realized that if there was an iron fence on the rail, the trains would be more efficient.
Although this became common, the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually wooden wheels replaced iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first form of transport was walking; humans began walking standing up two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors were Southern Copts who didn't walk normally.
Bipolar glaciation was present in southern fossil coppi from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Chadian coastal people may have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmentally active to reduce the future pain.
It's just like most supportive care, however, if we're not just looking for a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and we need to deactivate it.
It's clear that the world has changed because of human advances in science and technology, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the strange way of life of humans.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a draft of the letter, signed by John Hancock, the Speaker of Congress, and Charles Thomson, the Secretary, was sent to the John Dunlap Press, a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, now known as Dunlap ads.
It was John Nixon who first read the document in public on July 8th in the Independence Square.
On July 6, a letter was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, a letter arrived in London.
The Dunlap 25 is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original manuscript is not extant.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, most people don't recognize them as dinosaurs.
But there are still many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have hairy legs and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a terracotta.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in computer terminology these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits.
Internal toxicity is not immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they cannot be detected immediately.
The best cause of internal poisoning may be the presence of an empty medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the specific first aid labels for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term Sass in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adaptable to parasitism in humans.
Both killer insects and bed bugs are bed-dwellers, meaning they adapt to living in a nest or living in a host.
Across the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), a major neurodegenerative disease in younger and older adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research has shown that MS is twice as likely to occur in women as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or that of their child.
These couples can arrange a family planning for their baby.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights to allow another couple to have custody of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the universe works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, this is not the case alone, it is an experiment and an experiment that is necessary to debunk one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and to create observations as well as to guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West severed its ties to its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
Many people often take physiological and behavioral rhythms seriously as being linked to the existence of the endocrine cycle and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic signs, have been recorded for most living organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillating mechanisms that continue a period of a free-ride cycle in the absence of external signs.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most prominent clues to DNA genetics.
Hershy and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA inside bacteria.
They did two experiments that tagged the DNA in the phage with phosphorus sulfide or the phage protein with sulfur sulfide.
The mutation can have very different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells involved are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in the same germ cells can be passed to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-friendly tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy landscapes such as flora and fauna.
Examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the city by car to go to work and are taken by others who go to work where they came from.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected to and supported by a transportation system based on personal cars.
Now science shows that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its sustainable states, where it has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is participating in society and using the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do we see them fail every day? Is it because of the inefficiencies of vehicle engineers? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow is indeed the study of the movement of autonomous drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is problematic, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency, and this can be determined almost mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three characteristics are determined: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) acceleration.
These relationships help with planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them escape from predators and find food and mates.
Most insects have the ability to turn their wings backward along their body.
This gives them the ability to hide from predators in a wider range of small spaces.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are the stingrays and the day-old mosquitoes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many had the opposite belief - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the earth.
That makes sense, because on the ground, you don't feel like you're moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. The amount of water it carries is eight times greater than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching six miles wide at points.
The full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the earth into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, no pyramid ever surpassed the three pyramids in size and technical superiority.
The new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians was amazed to see the monuments of their predecessors, buildings that had been walked on for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous among the countries.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislative and administrative communications.
Italian is also an everyday language spoken by most of the people working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these elements can be found in pure form in nature and are relatively easy to extract with basic tools.
Aristotle was a philosopher who formulated the fundamental hypothesis that all things are made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new matter and form what we observe.
Alloys are essentially a combination of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the end of this sentence.
So when pencils came out, they became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, pencils are used less.
People today type their messages on a computer screen, and they never have to go near a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what the multiplier will be like when something never works out.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to cluster a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like rolling a heavy load up a hill, splitting the nucleus of an atom and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay without signaling or with a small signal.
The lunar surface is made of rock and soil. The outer layer is called the lunar crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The sub-basins are thinner and the sub-plateaus are thicker.
As the shell becomes thinner, there may be more precipitation on the near side. The sludge is easier to surface.
Content theories are based on what people like or repeat.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that are internalized during development and adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do things they do and what are the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors emerge: one at the top of the spectrum trying to stay a friend.
This type of manager is involved in making unusual decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and accountability to people facing problems.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything that the team has been doing and do it himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to rifts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams have the same criteria of excellence as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their physical group.
They often have more autonomy than contract team members because their teams can organize meetings based on different time zones, but their local management may not recognize these time zones.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFascio, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The management team is the unconscious team to which each member reports. This unconscious team sets standards specific to each member.
Why would an organization want to enter the time process of establishing a training organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the operational units of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can happen.
As a result, the process of organizational collaboration to overcome barriers can lead to a new creative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurocognitive data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach that examines cognition, thus narrowing the scope of research and making it much more specific.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the backbone of scientists' research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, emotional trauma, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our brain processes.
Although AI has strong implications for science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the AI industry involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, timing, the ability to respond to customer problems and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such cases have become distinct disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being embedded in numerous home computers and video game software applications.
Scholarly tours are a major part of every classroom. Teachers often like to take their students to places where they don't have the option of traveling by bus.
Technology offers a solution by enabling virtual science trips. Students can view ancient museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting alongside their classmates in class.
Sharing a science tour is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, which is revised annually, but older versions are kept online to be used as a notebook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often start their blogging with a lot of grammatical and spelling confusion, having an audience generally makes a difference.
Since students are often the most point-oriented audience, bloggers strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Although blogging  forces students to be more aware of the world around them, the need to satisfy the interest of the students' audience encourages awareness and interest (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school day programs.
Proper use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical individuals; and through active response to online content, students can define their positions in the text of others' posts as well as express their views on specific topics (Oravak, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating and bilingual capital city and is home to a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south, Niagara Falls lies, and to the north lies the natural beauty of the Muscovy Mountains and beyond.
All of these and more make Ontario stand out to outsiders as something that is truly Canadian.
Large areas in the northernmost regions are completely sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabitable wilderness areas.
For a demographic comparison that may surprise many: There are more African Americans than Canadians in the United States.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and the largest continent of its kind.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxury beaches.
The Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and it was formed on a large scale in the Comoros and Mayotte.
And the European colonial influence began in the 15th century, when Vasco da Gama, as a Portuguese explorer, found the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is surrounded by a desert coastline and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female travellers, regardless of their actual marital status, say they are married.
It's also beneficial to get a ring (not necessarily a ring that looks expensive.
Women need to recognize that cultural differences can lead to events that they find upsetting and unlikely to be followed and held by hand, etc.
Be firm in discouraging men and resist without fear (cultural differences don't make things better!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port, calling it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and then rebuilt it as Casablanca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city of Dar al-Bayda, and the Spanish traders who established their trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the cities in Morocco with the least attractive shopping areas.
Around the old city, you can find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as carpets, pottery, leather goods, pottery and a whole range of engravings, but all of these are for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east and near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of the Niragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Although security in Goma is responsibly maintained, any visits outside Guma should be weighed against the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Niragongo volcano, along which there are the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a motor taxi to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
The city of Timbuktu, which had almost no access, has led to its name being used as a metaphor for strange and inaccessible lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it has a tourist attraction and an airport due to its antiquity.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the Lewis Gates PBS special called "Wonders of the African World".
It is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African characteristics.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches from the east along the border with Mozambique and from the north along the border with Zimbabwe, with its southern border being the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different biogeographical regions, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for protection and entry.
Buying a game card that allows access to a selection of South African parks or all South African national parks can be useful.
Hong Kong Island has been named the Hong Kong Mainland and is a place that many tourists consider to be their main tourist focus.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline look like a bright bar chart that is revealed by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite side of the mouth of the Kowloon coast.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the northern coastline on reclaimed land.
This is a place that the British colonizers took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest integrated belt of mangroves in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast of Bangladesh and India to the interior.
Sunderbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part of the Indian territory is called Sunderbans Forest Park.
These forests are not just Karna swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the massive forests that once covered the Sindh and Ganges basins.
The Sundarbans area is about 3,850 km2 and about one third of it is water.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 deer seen in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-regional station (over the river) throughout the day, but most of them run between 06:30 and 07:30 especially with the destination of East and Jakarta/Bomtegong.
Since inter-regional buses are often full, it is recommended to book tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are covered by small Japanese sea buses that are comfortable and tight.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oiapoque River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two lanes each 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance below the tower is 15 metres. Its construction was completed in August 2011 and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be completed in September 2017, the expected completion date for the customs stations.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsisting on agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá who made a living by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the Colony of the Giant Indians, was born as a result of the encounters of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to retain many of its indigenous characteristics since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best youth teams and the best players in the world.
The biggest race of the year takes place in December at the Chugán Fields of Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on competitions and where to buy tickets for adult competitions, check out Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is fixed at the value of one British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley and alongside the FIC West store, allows for cash conversions.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted in the outlying islands, although UK and US currency are accepted; please arrange the accepted payment method with the owners in advance.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures typically reach over 30 degrees Celsius.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity go hand in hand to make you feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There is no specific dry season and rainy season: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials are advising you to stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from other wildlife!
American buffalo, elk, moose, bear and almost any large animal, however tame they may seem, can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping the proper distance. These are large, wild, and inherently dangerous animals, so stay away from their private property.
Also, be aware that the odor attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking contaminated food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port is famous for stopping the invasion of the fleet in 1889, when seven German, US and British ships did not leave the port.
All but one British warship was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Maoist-led struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese chief Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's location between two harbours, there are many beaches.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Donport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where swimming is safe and most of them have the shade of the Povoutokava trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches is located in the Port of Waitemata, in the suburbs of the popular cities of Mission Bay and St. Helier's in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes busy and have good shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called Manta.
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better transported.
Drinking local milk water is perfectly safe, but if you're scared, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, flat white coffee is a foreign idea. Black shorts are the same as espresso, cappuccino is served with plenty of cream (and not just flour), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is within Belgian standards, juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to coral reefs take place year-round, and injuries from these factors are rare at coral reefs.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are present near the coasts and near the mouths of northern rivers from October to April 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being at the mouth of the river north of Rockinghamton.
Booking in advance reminds the traveler to have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, although you can probably find out about other types of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, coordinated transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also make time for you if you need time to think about the offer or to prepare other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Therefore, any amendments or requests should be made through the travel agent's representative and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, a large portion of the music festival audience decides to camp on site, and most of the audience considers this part an integral part of the program.
If you want to get close to the stage, you have to get there early so you can get a campsite close to the age of the music.
Remember that although the music may have ended in the main performance scenes, portions of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location as relatively scary sounds can be heard when crossing the ice for those most affected.
A stay in St. Petersburg includes spending time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows and no clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually offer food, drinks and special entertainment to keep guests entertained and stay in place.
Some saloons serve alcoholic beverages, however, drunkenness interferes with judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
There's less friction on icy roads and you can't drive on bare pavement.
During a storm, snow can fall so hard in one moment that you get trapped.
It may also be limited by falling or snowfall or by the presence or concentration of ice on the window of a vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and transit is mostly continuous throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, attracting many visitors.
The term safari generally refers to a land trip to observe the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars and standard equipment allows for proper viewing.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with a hunting camera.
A safari is a walk (also called a "walk on the hills", "walk on the safari", or "walking") that involves walking for several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will run from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of these events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a dire situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not continue until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket cost of around 7,000 yen.
Wet clothes can be oiled to help dry them. In many hotels, oils and a table can be borrowed, even if not in the room.
If a washing machine is not available or you do not wish to wear socks, you can use a washer if you have access.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause water leakage or, in worse cases, burn).
There are various methods for water treatment, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, and in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're concerned about this, you should consider buying your drinking water in bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter a variety of animals that are unfamiliar to them in their native areas.
Poisonous animals spoil food, cause harassment or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread their venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with their own power are not usually described as disasters.
Shopping from duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy goods without paying taxes and duties in some places.
Travel restrictions for countries with heavy taxes can sometimes result in significant savings, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between the Pointe Marion and Fairmont areas has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo Highway, as it crosses the globe through scattered forested land.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes and more sharp turns.
The speed limits installed are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than in the other sections.
Surprisingly, mobile phone service here is much stronger than other places along the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wild.
German desserts are very good and varied and rich in Bavaria, and are more similar to what is cooked in its southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit desserts are common. Apple desserts are cooked year-round and cherries and plums are used for decoration in the summer.
Many German desserts have almonds, nuts and other tree dried fruit. Popular cakes are often served with a cup of thick coffee.
If you want small but full desserts, just try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region you are in.
Curry is food prepared with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of fluid, the action can be either dry or hot.
In the middle northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in sunbathing; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the nation, as Indonesia has a choice of 17,000 islands.
However, if not used in more specific jurisdictions, the term originally means food and is derived from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese food, now widely available throughout the Algerian archipelago, contains a range of simple, spicy dishes, the dominant Javanese flavourings being peanuts, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of spices.
A recliner is sometimes for the rider's leg that hangs on either side of the seat.
Although they provide greater stability for the rider, they can also pose safety concerns because the rider's legs are likely to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse and his foot gets caught in the saddle, the horse will be pulled to the ground if he escapes.
First, most bikers wear motorcycle boots that have slender heel and very narrow claws.
Later, some harnesses, especially English harnesses, have safety bars that allow the rider's skin to separate from the harness in the event of a fall.
In Cochamó - the top mountaineering destination in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite and has different types of granite walls and rocks.
At the highest point, you can see breathtaking views of the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes among the numerous and potentially wall-shaped routes.
Winter hill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you use a ski pole or snowboard attached to your feet to ride on sloping snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main activity of the trip, which is popular with many and is sometimes known as skiing, meaning planning an entire holiday around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old -- cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5,000 BC.
The sport of hill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called skiing in remote areas, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not usually include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring skis and tighter boots.
Think of a ski trail the same way you think of a hiking trail.
In good weather, you can cover much more distance than you can on foot - but it is very rare to get cross-country skiing fast without a heavy backpack on regular trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between multiple countries requires multiple visa application and passport control procedures.
However, the Schengen area acts like a country in this sense.
As long as you are in the area, you can generally cross the border without having to re-check your passport.
Also, with a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of obsolescence for manufactured goods. Some tax authorities consider goods older than 100 years obsolete.
This definition varies geographically, especially in areas such as North America where the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be defined as antiquated, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the cultural exchange that exists around its trade is also important for many other professions.
Although traditionally, not all Sami people were involved in large reindeer farming, they lived by fishing, hunting, and the like, and used reindeer mostly as domesticated animals.
Today many Sami work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word coli is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting has a travel warning, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to use advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Warnings are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, general and very simple compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for dangerous weather phenomena that are likely to cause damage and disruption to social life or cause loss of human life.
Dry weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and fires as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterfalls and seasonal storms are all forms and effects of extreme weather.
Extreme regional and seasonal weather phenomena include thunderstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any potential severe weather conditions affecting their area as these conditions can affect travel plans.
Anyone who intends to visit a country that is a war zone must undergo professional training.
An internet search for the phrase 'environmentally hostile' will likely yield the address of a local company.
A training course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail and usually includes practical experience.
A training course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing and a high volume of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books and magazines about wildlife survival, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travellers who plan to change their gender abroad must carry valid documents for the return journey.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue genderless (X) passports or to update documents to match people's desired names and genders.
The willingness of foreign governments to certify these documents varies widely.
Security checkpoints have also become much more intense in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender people should not expect to pass scans before surgery while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the rebound currents of waves that move from the coast to the sea, often occurring in a rock or similar location.
The return current is concentrated in several deeper areas due to underwater topology, and rapid flow to the water depths may occur there.
Most deaths occur from fatigue caused by trying to swim against the tide, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, it won't be any harder to swim back to normal.
Try to target a location where you won't get trapped again, or, depending on your skills, whether or not they notice you, you can wait for rescue operations.
Homecoming shock occurs earlier than culture shock (it is less severe than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to return to their native culture.
When you return home from living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your homeland.
At the beginning of their foreign travels, people were probably patient and understanding, and knew that travelers who arrived in a new country needed to adapt.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travellers returning home.
The sound of the pyramid and the light show is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can watch them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you can always hear the voices of tourists and vendors.
The Sphinx is set behind the scenes and narrator of a long story.
These scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the various pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries and have the most active bases with sixteen in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres north of the peninsula. Its largest island is King George, and its residential area is called Villa Las Estrellas (Village of the Stars).
Other islands include Livingstone and Deception, whose volcanic lake over an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Thurworthland is a region in the south of the peninsula bounded by the Billingshausen Sea.
The peninsular mountains here merge with the plateau, then bring back the calcium to form a 360-kilometer chain of Elmworth Mountains that the Minnesota glacier has split in two.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Mount Vinson, which rises 4,892 metres (16,080 ft).
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are not generally a replacement for cell phones, because to make a phone call you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite.
The service is used globally by ships, including recreational and tourist boats that carry remote voice data and requirements.
Your local telephone provider should be able to provide more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option is certainly for people who plan a year-long break and dedicate it to travel and learning.
It is especially popular among recent school leavers, allowing them to take a year off before university without risking their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education when you return home.
Usually, a fee is charged for enrolling in these training programmes.
Finland is a great destination for kayaking. It is the "land of a thousand lakes" with thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal peninsulas.
You don't necessarily need a pleasure boat in this complex of islands and lakes.
Although the archipelago's coastline and larger lakes are large enough for sailboats, small boats and even sailboats offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It's like Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it's very unique (in the Netherlands, for example, it's one in forty).
A feature of many distinctive Baltic cruises is that they have long stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a few full days visiting this historic city, while returning to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only take pleasure boats on the beach, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochure. But as you can see from the map above of Berlin, no part of the city is near the sea and visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic accident.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different than the personal fear and hatred of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how planes work and what happens during flight may help overcome the fear that comes from the world of the unknown and lack of control.
Peak companies are paid well for quick delivery of products. Usually, time is of the essence in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for quick repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies had their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller companies there was a problem.
If they were sending things by airmail, in some routes it might take days for air and customs to load.
The only way to get there faster was to send it as checked baggage.
The common practice of flying first or business class is to borrow a large amount of money for points (or better yet, you can ask your company to arrange it).
However, it doesn't come cheap: a general rule says you can expect to pay four times the normal rent for economy mode for commercial mode and 11 times that for first-class!
In general, searching for discounts for business and first class seats on flights from A to B is pointless.
Airlines are well aware that a group of air passengers in an emergency are willing to pay a high price for the benefits of fast and comfortable travel and price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that suffers from ethnic and tribal conflict.
In 1994, the dispute led to the creation of the Autonomous Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and common currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion of the Moldovan people is Orthodox Christianity.
Özmir is the third largest city in Turkey and the second largest port after Istanbul, with a population of about 3.7 million and is one of the most important transportation hubs in the country.

Wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market and old mosques and churches stand out, although the atmosphere is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Hadarsvik has a view of an island near Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the courtyard of this church there are interesting marble statues of doves on some of the tombs.
It's worth a half-hour's drive around this charming village.

Please remember that you are essentially visiting the site of a mass grave, and also a place that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived here, and many others who had loved ones murdered there or worked so hard that they died, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please visit this place with all the dignity, honor and respect it deserves.
Don't disfigure this place by painting walls or carving on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand the language and almost all speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is recognized in law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other places.
Normal subway notifications are only in Catalan, but out-of-program disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.

If you show some basic manners, the seemingly unexpected behavior of the Parisians will be immediately addressed.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has a rich forest cover and is mainly covered with species of rush, Christmas and willow trees and has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a significantly wide diversity of plant community due to the wide range of microclimates, different soils and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to a great diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, black bear, wild cat and black wild goose can be found here along with many other common species.
During the visit to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and the shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries have appropriate coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your coverings, especially a brightly colored one, you will receive a smile from a monk or nun when you enter.
Under similar regulations, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the pantry in the lobby, but the clothes are not washed by the user after each use, so you may not feel good when wearing these gowns.
Majorcan cuisine, like similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil from start to finish.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, especially during summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any kind of available seasoning such as cheese, tuna etc.
All names, besides the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even if they come in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and some verbs.
It also makes reading significantly easier, although writing is somewhat complicated and requires knowing whether a verb or adjective is used correctly.
Pronouncing Italian words is relatively simple, since the pronunciation of most words is exactly the same as writing them.
The first letters you should be careful with are c and g, because their pronunciation varies according to the vowels that come after them.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
So, reading this grammar primer will help you learn more about Persian grammar and recognize phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know one of the Romance languages, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it does not need separate examination.
Pre-modern observatories are now usually abandoned and are now museums or educational centers.
Because light pollution was not initially a problem but is now, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms (hanami) has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept comes from China, where the flower of choice was the aloe.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom ceremony is performed by the emperor and only for himself and members of the nobility close to the imperial court.
Plants are at their best when in the wild, so resist the temptation to remove just one specimen.
If the visit to the garden is officially arranged, collecting the samples without any discussion will result in your expulsion.
Singapore is very safe in general and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But being in the Northern Hemisphere, just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with the heat and the intense sunlight.
A few buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the great biblical priests including Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are taking goes to Al Khalil and not just to the Jewish suburb of Arba.
Waterways that run through the land can be a good choice for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a trip to interesting places on the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also determine popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the anniversary of the birth of Jesus.
Many of the holiday's traditions have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter Eve awake in the most exposed places to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian religious justifications for this tradition, but it is safe to say that it may have been a celebration of spring and harvest in pre-Christian times.
Most traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter holiday, while the congregation often celebrates at midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands either swam, flew or floated.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not travel there, so the giant tortoise is the main animal that roosts in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced to the island, including goats, horses, cows, mice, cats and dogs.
If you visit the North Pole or the South Pole in winter, you'll see a polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark during the daytime.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and often do not cause light pollution, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Clothing is standard workwear, and colleagues call each other by their surnames or job titles.
Compromise is critical in the workplace, and it should emphasize teamwork rather than individual success.
Workers often have to get their bosses' approval for every decision they make and are expected to obey their bosses' instructions without reason.
