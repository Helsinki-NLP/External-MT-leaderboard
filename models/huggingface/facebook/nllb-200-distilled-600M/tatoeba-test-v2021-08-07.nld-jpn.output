How hot is it today, huh?
It's very hot today.
How are you feeling today?
How are you feeling today?
I tried not to cry today.
Looks like it's gonna be a long day today.
There were no clouds today.
There's no wind today.
I don't have time right now.
️We've had a lot of rain this month.
What did you do this morning?
It's very cold this morning.
That's why I got up early this morning.
The man we saw this morning was Mr. Green.
I've been reading this book.
I'll fix it now.
I'm busy right now because my house needs cleaning.
I wish I knew the answer now.
I'm in the bathroom right now.
I was fired.
I'm gonna finish this job somehow.
I'll do the work tomorrow.
It takes a long time to finish this job.
What else does Tom need?
Do you play any other instruments besides the piano?
Is there anything else you wanna ask?
I can't think of any other way.
We're out of bread.
I can't wait any longer.
Tom lies on his back.
Do you have friends in your class?
Let's be friends.
Leave that to me.
A man named Mr. Itoh wants to meet you.
Let's rest a while.
When I'm free, I go to the movies, I hang out in the café, and I'm in the kitchen.
When I'm free, I take care of my nephew and go out to dinner with friends.
Nice to meet you.
The meeting took place yesterday.
I'd like to check out, so my bill, please.
This conversation is being recorded.
️Not all infectious diseases are contagious.
Uncle Ken has a big chicken farm.
Get in your seats, ready, off!
John?
Where do you live?
You live in Turkey?
I don't have the address.
I don't have the address now.
Do you have Tom's address?
"Do you believe that love can be achieved without a physical relationship?" "Yes, of course. Although it probably depends on the other".
So what?
"Hey, Tom"."What's up?""Leave it alone".
Let's try something!
What?
"Sorry I can't mean anything to you"."No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tom is not doing anything.
What are you doing?
Why me?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
What is that?
What is this?
What do you want to do?
I'm uncomfortable with everything I do, and people say I'm slow to understand.
How many Santa Claus are there?
How many players do you need for rugby?
A couple of boys came into the classroom.
How many people have you told?
What are you gonna use it for?
I managed to get in.
What is the cause?
How many languages do you speak?
How many languages do you speak?
Thank God nothing is broken.

There was plenty of time to talk to friends.
Friends invited me to dinner.
As a friend, he takes responsibility.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
Totoro makes friends with everyone.

Please give me the scissor.
Don't take it seriously.
Tom has a mustache growing.
Please shut up!
It's an old piano.
It's an old law.
"What a cute puppy. Why is it called a panda?" "Because its face looks like a panda".
Tom is in the kitchen.
"It looks like the typhoon is coming this way"."Yes. I just hope not that school is closed tomorrow"."
Tom swims as well as Mary.

Can I ask your name?
Excuse me, what was your name again?
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?
Didn't you hear your name being mentioned?
Please tell me your name.
Write your name here.
Chopin is at the piano and starts playing.
This is a present for you.
You look like a.
I could enjoy my day off the most by spending time with you.
What would you do if you had 10,000,000 yen?
What a surprise to see you here.
Green is good for you.
Whatever you say, I'll marry her.
I believe you.
What would you do if you were me?
I need your help.
Have you solved all the problems?

You're students, and only now can you do something like that!
How many rooms are there in your house?
You gotta get up a little early.
Does he know you love him?
You should have told him the truth.
You don't have to do it right away.
I can't forget you.
You're behaving yourself in a way that's not good to talk about.
There will be objections to your proposal.
Did you call me last night?
What time is it on your watch?
Iris, what do you usually eat for breakfast?
If possible, you should investigate the matter yourself.
Do you really believe ghosts exist?
You always wear a screaming tie.
I can't live without you.
You don't have a fever.

Tony speaks English better than me.
Compare your answers to the professor's.
Compare your answer to Tom's.
You should have introduced yourself.
You're young, but I'm very old.
You'd better go.
I'm glad your team won the game.
I have something to tell you.
You have a bright future ahead of you.
I don't care what happened to you.
I want you to go to the post office.
You shut up!

Dick tried to solve the problem in vain.
The question was too difficult for me to solve.

I hate liars.

I can't lend you this book.

When that volcano suddenly erupted, many people died.
Fire is burning.
I agree with you on this one.
I'm relieved you're safe.

Free advice isn't always good advice.
Don't you think it smells a little burnt?
You smoke?
You smoke?
You got a fever?
Why don't you measure your body temperature?
No, Dad.
How old is your dad?
Papa fixed my old watch.
Is your father a doctor?
My father doesn't like football.

I lost the watch my father gave me.
My father doesn't eat much fruit.
When my father was 50 he finally learned to drive.

My father loves my mother.
Papa and mama were sitting under a tree.
Papa made me swim.


What a big dog!
I like dogs.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you like dogs or cats?
A dog chases a cat, and the cat chases a mouse.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Alice didn't see the dog.
We call our dog Pochi.
I'm far from happy with this situation.
️Mexico was not yet independent of Spain.
Tom is single.
Tom is single.
Tom is single.

The hound went into the woods.
The cat kept on mucking.
The cat is very sweet.
The cat pulled his claws in.
Cats can see even in dark places.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
That's not a cat.
Is that a cat or a dog?
The cat was playing with a live mouse.
Cats like fish more than meat.
That cat is brown.
The cat is black.
The best horse stumbles sometimes.
Honestly, I don't like your idea.
Prince Charles will be the next king of England.
Wang came to Japan to study Japanese.
Long live the king!
Can I ask why?

Yumi won't play tennis, right?

I remember the man's name very well.
The boy has never been to the zoo.
The boy grabbed the dog by the tail.
The man was arrested as a spy.
Bill was killed by that man.
The man committed murder.
The man attacked her with the intention of killing her.
There's a very old temple in town.
I'll show you the city.
Are you an exchange student?
There is no objection on my part.
Tom did not agree.
Are you tired?
If you're tired, go to sleep.
You look tired, so you better get some sleep.
Nice work!
Ah, stop that!
That hurts!
It was very painful.
I have a stomach ache.
I'm in pain right here.
I have a stomachache.

I'm so busy, my head's so full.
I have pain in my eyes.
I have pain in my eyes.

When Tom woke up, Mary was at the desk reading a book.
Close your eyes.

Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.
I can't sleep.

I was born on March 23, 1969, in Barcelona.
That's mine.
This is my cousin.
It's not my fault!
I'm on a diet.
I have to look for my pen.
I want to stay here.
You couldn't let me do that?
Why me?
Where are my cigarettes?
We played football yesterday.
I am an only child.
Let me say it once.
We have to do the work within the day.

We spoke softly so that the baby wouldn't wake up.
I can walk.
I can run.

I bought a pair of boots.
It's kind of you to give me a ride.
I'm going to church by car.
I tried to shut down the traffic noise.
That's my dictionary.
I met her on the street.
We went to the park to play.
We work from 9:00 to 5:00.
We enjoyed the party.
This is the church we got married in.
We eat lunch together often.
Uncle Bob invited us to dinner.
Let's clean our room.
There are many books in my room.
I like to decorate my room with flowers.

I went to the post office.
We played hockey yesterday.
Our baseball team is very strong.
I like watching baseball games.
I am neither rich nor do I want to be rich.
I don't have a pencil.
I work at a bank.
You know where my key is?
I've lived here for a long time.
Do I have it wrong?
I'll help you as much as I can.
We're flying over the clouds.

We're used to wearing shoes.
We're listening to music.
I'm in the bath.
I can't live like this.
I'd rather go by plane.
I'm eating an apple.
I'm on a diet.
I think you should eat more.
I didn't have time to eat.
Don't even think about eating my chocolate!
I went to the train station.
I'm used to the noise.

I saw a bird flying through the air.
I don't like science.
That's a secret.
Cat's got no tail.
There are pitless grapes and pitless watermelons, but would there be pitless mangoes?
The air is blurred by the winter sky.
The stars were not visible in the sky.
There are many stars to see in the sky.
John is at the airport.
The sky is blue.
️Please open the window.
Can I open the window?
Can I open the window?
Get up!
We were standing outside the door, waiting.
-Honey, that's funny.

The advantage of marriage is that you get to know the true nature of the female gender, and the disadvantage of marriage is that you get to know the dehumidification about the female gender, so unmarried writers are not yet able to write women, and their married poets are no longer able to sing praises to women.
After all, everyone has to learn for themselves.
Statistics are concerned with numbers that represent reality.

Get rid of my arm!
How hungry are you, Tom?
I was very hungry.
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!
I started having trouble understanding what I was saying.
Believe in yourself.
Romeo can't even write his own name.
I don't know why I like Tom so much.
You must protect your family.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
Don't forget your stuff.
You drew this yourself?
️Don't impose your opinion on others.
You dropped your pocketcloth.
You just have to clean your room.
The car is running fast.
Can I introduce myself?
You wanted to tell me about freedom?
When I put in a hundred yen at the coffee machine and pressed the button, four cans of coffee came down at once!

Have you been to Paris?

Please don't go.

Let's go by bus.
Well, let's get going.
Where did you just go?
Where'd you go?
Where are you going?
He said you didn't have to go.

First they saw the mess, then they looked at each other.
You'd better get your cigarette out before Terry sees it.

Touch this, it's very soft.
I said I'm sorry.
Don't lie to me.
"About four pounds", Bob says.
Don't tell Tom about it.
Tom knows what Mary said.
Tom didn't believe what Mary said.
Now that you've said it, have you found the umbrella you said you lost the other day?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
"I like when people say I'm cute", Tom said a little embarrassed.
"I forgot to say you need sandals, so don't forget to take them with you"."What? I should have said sooner!"
You'd better not say it.
Listen to what I'm saying.
I feel like it's been a long time since I heard that last.
It's the first time I've heard this word.
What you don't want to say, you don't have to say.

Can I tell Tom?
Do you speak Toki Pona?
Tom is talking.
Please speak as clearly as possible.
