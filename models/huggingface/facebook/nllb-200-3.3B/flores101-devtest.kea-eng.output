This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as three-dimensional hearts and dispositions.
Scientists say that the plumage of these animals was brown on the upper side and pale on the lower side, or carotenoid.
The findings also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a highly developed axis, called the rack, but have other characteristics of feathers  farpas and barbula  researchers have deduced that the rack was probably an evolutionary development later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather in regulating or monitoring temperature. Investigators have suggested that, while this is a remains of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not a pinprick.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: electors insulate their heads in a bible, place a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating their candidate for the election in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

The driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services left the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalised at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of his son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but every eyewitness can be contacted because his image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the justice system works differently and courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, observed that journalists are not likely to be in danger if they publish photos, etc., of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for the judicial process, told journalists that no further comment would be made until the indictment was filed.
The document, according to leaked information, refers to the disputed borders, which Palestine had claimed on the basis of borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem as a sacred city for both nations and the question of the Jordan River.

In addition to the NPWS and the Sports Car Club of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the auspices of the Sports Car Club of Australia's summer program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation and NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received detailed instructions and safety training.
Martelly yesterday appointed a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to take the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, once violent, were marred by the non-realization of elections, some of the first since 2011.
About 60 cases of overloading of iPods with defects have been reported, which has caused a total of six incidents and left four people with minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had knowledge of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overclocking, which it called "serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "really regrettable".
The submarine reached the Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday-Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Response Office said no damage was reported in the country.
However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer holds Hong Kong tourists hostage after they take their car from a gang in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many reefs have been recovered and six peltenomens have been confirmed as dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and idols, were released later, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of a female idol, as she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started working at the Auckland Maternity Hospital in 1959.
As a hospital orderly, Liggins began to investigate preterm labor during her free time.
Her research showed that if given a hormone, it accelerates the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders in cash.
Wrestling associates also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "The Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first heroine. The Moon died in the night of the second moon. A single soul like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that Luna was as crazy as me...maybe even more so...I love her and I'm so lucky for her...I hope she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people killed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would return to a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Just 34 percent of those surveyed shared their opinion, that they believe Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Depending on the results of the poll, 29 percent of respondents agreed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent agreed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist must swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in all three of the Community Games centres, but because of her complaints her fitness is in doubt.
He is unable to take the medicines he needs to get better, since they are forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and a professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number ever on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using different hardware and software in early February and announced on Tuesday.
Flowers can positively digest the source of supply of water to the soil along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the earth, which has been in contact with the earth for thousands of years.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this decade and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as tagarelisi y tolisa pulitiko.
It is speculated that he may run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to travel on shorter routes and burn millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology based on terrestrial radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
It is not possible for any other transportation conveyance under the train not to stop at Wembley and the car park and stop and take stations are not available on the train.
The lack of transportation has raised the possibility of the game being forced to be postponed without team supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new species of lizard in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, but believe that this process had delayed much longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin endemic shrub, Geospiza fortes, an immigrant cactus shrub, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be cut into a thin strand, which can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued to another metal. It can be made very thin, which was once used to decorate the pictures painted on the walls of books called illuminated manuscripts.
It is possible to make an indicator with the sap of the coconut tree.
The amount of cooking oil varies greatly depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the product is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Take the two dry powders together and then, with my clean and moist, sprinkle them inside the ball.
The moisture in your mouth is then filled with a strange, half-mooned liquid that forms a kind of conch.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the screw systems were found in the ruins of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Baths were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the bathtub was often part of a public bath in which men and women were in the same room.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the light and then reflects it back down again, almost instantly.
Satellites sent into space by a small craft. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It is a tiny hole more than 100 feet high to hold a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world dramatically, and the greatest thing it has done for us is make transportation much easier and faster.
We brought trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Their lower half has more medium-sized males that eat the medium-sized prey, since the care is taken by antelopes and vipers.
Finally, there are many small animals (including the wild cat) that eat small prey much more often, such as insects, rodents, frogs and birds.
The secret of their survival is the concept of the nest, a special function each cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the lion's offspring, and they live in large groups called alkatheia.
The Alkateia has one to three adult members of the family, along with about thirty women and children.
Usually wives are intimately related to each other, often with a large family of sisters and sisters.
Lions' pack animals act much like wolf packs or dogs, they are surprisingly lion-like animals (but unlike other large animals) in behavior, and also quite murderous with their prey.
As a well-trained athlete, the tiger can crawl (but not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human being.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four young are the only ones that can blush.
The tiger's roar is not a lion's roar, but a phrase of growling and shouting.
Jaguatirica likes to eat small animals. They mate with macaques, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Most animals that jaguatirica marries are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the oselot tracks and finds prey through the holes in the walls of the nest.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, as well.Oselotis mate their prey by mixing with their environment and then they jump on their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as by moving up a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they are often not very different from the environment they were in before.
These new environments have different resources and different environments, however the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger environment than those previously required.
The original population has not changed at all, but it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations began to adapt to their new environments, they began to appear less and less like other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations have a completely different appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., expel).
Plants make their food by sunlight through photosynthesis. They also give sleep.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was a predator of the apes of his day, so it was not afraid of anything, except of other mosasaurs.
Its upper jaw was covered with over 70 teeth, along with a pair of extra teeth in the roof of the mouth, which meant that anything that passed through the mouth was not to be missed.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had a thick tongue, ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
It can also attack anything that enters the body; even a giant dinosaur such as T. rex would not be able to withstand it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boars, peacocks, caracols, and a type of deer called the arganaz.
Another difference is that while the poor and the woman ate their meals sitting on the table, the rich enjoyed a common banquet where they sat on the side while they had their meals.
Ancient Roman diet could not have included foods brought from the Americas or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had spiced peppers.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, which was considered the home of the gods.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through these ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then the inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Special pyramidal structures called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to this goddess.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, this house was not a mere shelter.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the kitchen; shops were just balconies facing the street; stone was used for the construction of houses.
The land of Canaan was sparsely populated, and timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was colonized relatively recently. Norse sagas tell of Erik the Green, banished from Iceland by homicide, and traveling west, finding Greenland and naming it Gronelándia.
Regardless of his discovery, the Scythian tribes were already living there at that time.
Although the entire country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a map of the United States was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. The appearance of the writing is a sign of a document, not a map of the area.
The text of the Declaration of Independence was written in the words Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776. The text appears in the lower part of the document, from top to bottom.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, early in its life, this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inch by 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for storage.
However, it is likely that the notation was simply christened as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French Vichy, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders in the guise of war against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defining, in some ways, the dimensions of society.
City-states are precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge through various generations, a shared cultural growth and a fair spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not able to be recognized as adequate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed the first central government with Congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
However, he did not have the authority to override laws and taxation within the state.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they were amended and the States were not bound by the central government in such a way that their representatives were almost always unable to vote.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan comprises, Japan is often referred to as, not a geographical location, as an  archipelago
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who once passed by the island first recorded its name as Formosa Island, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the practices of aboriginal cereal production and employing Chinese laborers in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three major structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the top of the complex have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and that restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the size of the dominant film in the late days of analog film.
It is still produced today, but, more importantly, its aspect ratio has been eroded by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm camera is in fact, half-confused, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The ratio of the aspect of the form (divided by twelve to get the ratio of the whole number simpler) is, however, referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal or very close to aspect ratio.
The most abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamism, while maintaining an unimaginable measure of order.
He claims that the most effective locale for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertically and horizontally tertiary (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subjected to control.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipotent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are there specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, and breaking the blockade in violation of generally accepted international law, codified by numerous international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent the entry of any ships into all sections of the ocean, and eventually endangered neutral shipping.
As a limited response to this tactic, Germany hoped for a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations resolved to prevent a similar situation from occurring again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept an appointment at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his secretary at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During the procession, there were violent fights between various nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the highest place in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
However, after the Revolution the occupations were open to all male candidates in order to allow the more ambitious and well-suited to succeed.
The same applies to troops because instead of troop certificates based on class, they are based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters other than the worldly life. He frequently used a cave known as Hira on the Mount of Noor (the light) for burial.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a hilltop north of Mecca, the cavern is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find anything, even if it is known to exist.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or observed from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that has survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Necropolis of Giza in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The sign ark up resembles a V and the sign ark down resembles a graph or a square without its inferior side.
Up means you start from the top and draw the arrow, and down means you start from the middle (which is where your mind will catch the arrow) and draw the arrow.
An upward bow will generally produce a softer sound, while a downward bow is louder and more assertive.
It is a good idea to put your mark with pencil, but remember that the markings of the printed score are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all fearful, were forced by a crowd of market-goers to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
Soon, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and cheering against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to close the windows of their carriage.
Suddenly, a crowd of thousands seized the body of a royal guard at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war damage of US imperialism in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial US government to cover most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, these superlatives resulted from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The epoch in which these events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impulses or technological imperatives to the narrow sense that human distinction is driven by a subconscious logic associated with scientific laws and the manifestation of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development follows a mutual path apart from cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has effects on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable just for cars counted in debt, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning cars.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on roads, and which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, as exemplified by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, while in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the effects of the Crusades and the arrival of goods such as silks and spices that were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th - 11th and 14th centuries.
Early dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowdown of communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, one of the major developments of the era, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to wear clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced for the production of sufficient food to satisfy the subsistence needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses native seeds from stored grains along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same mentality who feel alienated by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of the subculture frequently signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and clothing.
One of the most common methods used to describe the importance of socialization is the examination of the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some feral children have been confined by people (generally by their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of these children has occurred due to the parents' rejection of the child's intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are allegedly bred by animals; some are said to live in the wild to tell their own tale.
When fully bred by nonhuman animals, wild dogs exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of animals of particular concern, such as their fear or indifference to living creatures.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, attendance is a step in the process.
Assistance is not a learning method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as the use of computer software or the start of a new project.
Assistance can be both virtual and real, that is, a teacher is a form of assistance, but the man from the paper clip in Microsoft Office is also.
Virtual Assistants are embedded in software and are used to ask, suggest and explain procedures that may pose a challenge to a student to handle on their own.
Children may be in Family Home Care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even abuse.
The young never deviate from growing in an environment that is not warm, affectionate and educational, the more they grow.
We insist that Family Sharing Systems is a safe zone for these children.
Our family care systems should provide safe homes, loving care, stable education, and reliable health care.
Family hospitality should meet any needs that were lacking in the home where they once lived.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to more dimensions in terms of usage and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet usage (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuity of relationships' were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's response to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-spressions, phased movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if someone is telling lies by correctly interpreting microscopic images.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The Speech of the President, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speeches because of brain damage are equally capable of evaluating sincerity with conviction.
He even suggested that these capacities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic cats.
Research in the 20th century has revealed two groups of genetic variations: succulent and spruce.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of previously expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination prevent face-to-face variation between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from available vegetal resources.
However, failure to do so can have serious consequences: unprecedented births, malnutrition, and even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, mushroom, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
When all is said and done, it should not be surprising that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that the savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sound interruption is the process of repeating sound continuously during your normal sound period and returning to sound shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without completely waking you.
If you notice your head reshaping during the sound, you can place it on the other side of the room, or force yourself to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces people to fight for urine.
The amount of inner peace that a person has correlates inversely with the amount of stress on his body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the vital force is appreciated. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is accessible to everyone. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by various techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan mediation is Divine Yoga. Through the visualization of the many divinities, the channels of energy are cleansed, chakras are activated and the consciousness of light is increased.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and this led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the clashes of systems, processes and cultures led to the fall of the two countries.
With the end of the two wars, the former allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last forty years and be fought in earnest, with unprecedented success, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish Army had been destroyed, and the only hope was to rebuild and reorganize in western Romania.
However, this plan was aborted almost overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and marched on the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is arguably the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has always been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to deploy its people and assets, while at the same time, it interferes with your enemy's ability to deploy its people and assets.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans were attempting to transport men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly U-boats, was trying to stop the movement.
If the Allies were defeated, Germany would likely conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Iron Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes developed them to facilitate access to timber, cables, meat and fur.
Domestic goats were normally herded into the meadows that ran through the mountains and other grazing areas, often grazed by goat breeders who were often children or adolescents, such as the famous goat breeders. These methods of goat breeding are still used today.
The first carriages were built in England in the early 16th century.
While the carriages were made of single wooden planks side by side, the horses were able to pull them to higher speeds and carry more loads than on the slightly rougher streets of the day.
Crossing was introduced just enough to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was perceived that the tracks would be more efficient if they had iron overhead provision.
This became common practice, the more ferry provoking the more disgust at the wheel of the carriage.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first complete iron carriages were introduced.
The first known transport was walking, humans began walking slowly two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning red man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk as they normally would.
Two-legged speciation is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, while Sahelanthropus may have walked with two legs as recently as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can be activists ourselves, so that we can reduce future suffering to a certain degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. So, if we don't create a temporary solution, then we should look for the root causes of the problem, and we should address them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed dramatically as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been exacerbated by humanity's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After its approval by Congress on July 4, a draft manuscript signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's office, the quarterly distance reading office.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as the "large border".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A letter to George Washington on July 6, sent by him to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy of it arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known copies of the Dunlap Broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document, and the original manuscript has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they are very big.
In addition, many of the features of birds are still very similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have scaled and gnarled feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, i.e., 1 or 1, and this number is referred to as the binary digit - or bit, to use computer jargon.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an early diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be a warning from an open-air smoker or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific instructions from the primary care provider for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists without a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both, the Killer Beetle and the Kama Beetle are nesting beetles, adapted to living in the nest or nest of the nesting cat.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
EM is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or that of their children.
The couple may choose to make a baby-care plan.
In some cases, the biological father may terminate parental rights so that the other parent can take care of the child.
The primary objective of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides most scientific inquiry.
Moreover, experimentation, and an experience is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including psychology, were set.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West became isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and understanding are often crucial to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to the sterno periodic stress, have been documented by most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of free-running cycles, even in the presence of external tracks.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label either DNA from radioactive phosphorus or protein from radioactive enzyme-coated bottles.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the pool of affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the objective of appreciating the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Other activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about the organgatuangs in Borno.
Every morning, people leave small outdoor areas in cars to go to their workplace and they pass other people whose work distances are the same as where they just left.
In the age of dynamic transportation, everyone is in some way connected to a transportation system based on particular vehicles, which supports them.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of the stable states that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
The world's population is increasingly becoming more socially connected and more likely to use public transportation.
In developed countries you almost never hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges falling.
Why are transportation systems such a mess, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is there something more fundamental going on?
Transit flow is the study of the movement of vehicle drivers between two points and the interactions they have between them.
Unfortunately, studying transit traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior is unpredictable and without a sense of safety.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be more or less mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flows, establish relays between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These releases help in the planning, concession and operation of the railway infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly by air. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape faster from their enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their tails backwards over their bodies.
This gives them a greater variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and aphids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus predicted that the solar system would revolve around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but most people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and the other stars themselves).
That sounds reasonable, since the earth does not appear to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second largest river in the world, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's longest river, being about six miles [6.4 km] wide.
A full 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Bedouin Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technical perfection.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most of those working in the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The Vatican City is a Roman Catholic city.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, because they can all be discovered in nature in native forms and are relatively simple to extract from primitive materials.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they would transform into new substances to form the things we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. And of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small tones that trillions of years ago were at the end of sentences.
Yet, pencils were a good friend to many people when they first appeared.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing emerge, pencils have fallen out of favor and are used less.
People often type messages on a computer screen without ever having to reach for a computer screen.
We can only wonder what the key is when new things come along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes inertia to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a little piece of paper up a mountain, splitting the nucleus again, and then releasing some of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to disintegrate with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer chamber is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner below a maria and thicker above the high ground.
There may be more sediment on the near side because the crust is thinner, and it is easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The theory of relativity is centered on discovering facts that make people disoriented or attracted to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
Theories that explain the relationship between humans and their environment often explore the relationship between humans and their environment.
Two popular counting theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can arise as employees begin to lead their former colleagues. One of the aspects of the spectrum is trying to remain as one of the friends (or friends).
This type of manager has difficulty in making decisions non popular, realizing disciplinary issues, evaluating decisions, assigning responsibility to people.
At the other end of the spectrum, people transform into unreachable individuals who feel they must change everything the team has been doing and transform it into their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in arguments between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are maintained at the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but there is a slight difference.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for your immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than conventional teams, as their teams can meet according to variable schedules that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible eye" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual eye.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team defines the patterns for each member.
Why does an organization go through the slow process of creating a learning organization? One of the objectives of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized through the functional departments of an organization, creativity and commitment can be transparent.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, and also share organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method that is used to help organizations achieve a higher level of design.
Neurobiologists present physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, which, however, narrows the area of investigation and makes it more specific.
Correlations between brain pathology and behavior support scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and investigate structures and processes that were never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of material information to construct simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning and adaptation of non-machine intelligence.
Research on AI involves making machines automate tasks that require an intelligent behavior.
This includes control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and questions, and also the recognition of calligraphy, voice and facial expressions.
These have become specialized disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in areas of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as well as being embedded in many home computers and video game software.
Often, a teacher would like to take his students to a place where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions with virtual classroom visits. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a study tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is removed, but older versions are kept online to serve as a commemorative album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing.While students begin their blogging experience with dyslexic grammar and spelling, the perception of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers began to make efforts to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to have more knowledge about the world around them. The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be curious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning to each other beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can enable students to be more analytical and critical; through active response to Internet material, students can define their own position in the context of others' writings, as well as develop their own perspective on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting and bilingual capital of Canada and presents a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south lie the Niagara Falls and to the north is the home of the unexplored natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more distort Ontario as something that is considered purely Canadian by outsiders.
The larger areas further north are very sparsely populated and some are almost a desert uninhabited.
For a population comparison this is surprising to many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and the only continent where the issue of wildlife is not a matter of concern.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islon to these lands, and it had a great influence on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the river is bounded by the Sael, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
A ring (rather than a very expensive one) may also be helpful.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider as harassment and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, hugged, etc.
Be firm in saying no, and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C., and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronites as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around Midina bedju it is easy to find places of sale of traditional Moroccan products, such as taghines, ceramics, choir instruments, guns, and all kinds of bouillons, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which completely destroyed most of the city streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be encouraged to understand the ongoing war situation in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most expensive mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get to Goma. The normal (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for short trips.
Along with its relative inexorableness, Timbuktu has often been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Tinbuktu is a poor town, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the sands of the desert.
It was one of the main features during Henry Louis Gates' PBS Special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more Arabs than Africans.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders the Mosanbiki ap lesti, Zinbabué to the north, and the southern border is the Krukudilu River.
The park has 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entry fees to the park.
It may also be worth purchasing a Pasi Biheti, which allows entry either to select parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island forms the territory of Hong Kong itself and is the place where many tourists consider as their main focus.
The building blocks that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a graph of sinuous bars that appear to be present in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For better views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely populated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place where the British colonialists settled and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove coastal belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the Indian coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not only mangrove swamps but also include some of the last remaining populations of the large forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and close to 30,000 wild boars sighted in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, except for most buses, especially those going to Lesti and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district bus routes are almost always full, it is advisable to buy tickets with a few days' notice.
Most districts are served by small Japanese automobiles of the Coaster brand, which are compact and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River is a major tributary of the Oyapock River, which joins the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, have a 378 meters of concrete and two runways 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical distance below the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, at which time it is expected that the Brazilian customs control post will be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is today Eastern Paraguay, living as hunter-gatherers simi-nomads who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
Tournaments and smaller games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Falkland Pound (FKP), its value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be withdrawn from the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted in any part of the islands and with Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also usually accepted.
In the outlying islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, as they may have British and American currencies; check with owners first to determine which is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to bring Malvinas currency out of the islands, so bring cash before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice-versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be unusually cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, and wind and moisture combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specifically defined time of spring and summer: the amount of spring remains the same throughout the year.
While many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is, as usual, wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from any other wildlife!
Regardless of how they appear, bison, deer, elk, bear, and most other large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are fired for not maintaining proper distancing. The animals are large, fierce, and potentially dangerous, yet are left in their lurch.
In addition, it is known that the shrimp attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking raw food and keep camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of an initial naval raid in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain left the harbour.
All ships were sunk, except the British cruiser, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the location of the two ports in Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The northern coast sea beaches (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have sunshine provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the high-end suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are mostly beaches of familiar seafood with a good variety of shops lined up on the shores.
The main local dish is Number One, which is not a complex dish, but is rather pleasant and refreshing. The other local dish is called Manta.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be better shipped.
Storm water is perfectly safe for drinking, the more contaminated the water is the easier it is to find if you have a leak.
For Australians, the idea of white albu coffee is foreign. A short version is espresso, cappuccino comes filled with cream (no sparkling) and the tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and lectures on any of the causes of the reef are rare.
At the very least, accept the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The floods occurred near the sea and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks exist without, but rarely do they attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and they swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not actively found in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Anticipated reservation gives travelers the security of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have hotels and some hotels, but it may be possible to reserve other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include coffee, airport transport arrangements or even flight and hotel packages together.
They can also reserve your time if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your distinction (for example, a visa).
Any alterations or requests should be initiated primarily through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the large portion of participants who go to the music festival decide to stay in the venue and most participants consider it as a vital part of their experience.
If you are close to the stage, you have to go deeper to get a place of accompaniment near the music.
Keep in mind that while music in these main stages may have already been completed, there may be festival sessions that continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabins, as ice crossing makes noise accessible to the most affected.
Cruise ships in Saint Petersburg include the city's stadium. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize time and money spent by hosts. Windows and clocks are usually scarce, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment, to keep the guests in good spirits, and to keep them in the stable.
Some places offer alcohol on a charge, but we are not prejudiced by the amount of alcohol we drink, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who drives at high latitudes or who travels over mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with snow and ice, the drag is low and you can't drive as if you're on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow may fall to cover the area in a short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or snowballs or by condensation or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and the traffic is almost always continuous throughout the year.
The Sahara is perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and is visited by many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to see the magnificent African wildlife particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and equipment with a view of the surroundings.
Lions, chimps and leopards are very shy and you can observe them better with binoculars.

The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you book your airline tickets for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but starting in late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not go into effect until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a hot iron and a hot iron table ready for printing, even if they are not locked in the room.
If a wire cutter is not available, or if you do not like to wear wire cutting socks, then you can try using a wire cutter, if available.
Take care not to allow the tissue to become too soft (causing swelling, or in extreme cases, burning).
There were different forms of water purification, some more effective against specific ammonia.
In some areas, boiling water for a few minutes is sufficient; in others, several minutes is necessary.
Filters vary according to efficiency, and cases are of some concern, so you should consider buying your glass fitted from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests from animals they are not familiar with in their region of origin.
Pests can eat food, cause irritation or, in the case of ants, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can cause death or injury are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods without taxes and special consumption taxes at the place of destination.
Travellers with a distinction to the country with the higher taxation can, therefore, earn a good amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
The line between Point Marion and Fairmont presents more difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated mud flats.
If you are not used to driving on the open road, be careful: there are many steep inclines, narrow lanes and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and rigorous compliance with them is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, overall, cell phone service is much stronger here than in many parts of the road, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria it is as rich and varied as in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit doses are common, as is the dosage of apples throughout the year, and the dosage of peaches and plums appears during the summer.
Many German food products also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried fruit of the tree. Popular sausages often combine particularly well with a spicy, strong cheese.
If you create some more rich desserts, try some regional dishes, called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish consisting of aromatic herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A vessel may be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern interior regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is usually used in the kitchen.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
