This looks like a typical rugby club to me.
In an English college, maybe...
Nothing to do with any rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it's common in rugby is a big deal...
Yes, we don't interrupt Muslim prayers and break anyone's nose during drinking games (unless it's part of the game), but we've actually painted ourselves black for some disguised nights.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme that says that.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the first-year student brochure seemed rather typical to me.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt that they go far beyond the misogynistic jokes and drunken jokes that are often associated with college rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they try to provoke as much as possible.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But why let your prejudices and stereotypes get in the way of the facts?
I imagine the LSE rugby team is populated by former students from these schools for whom competitive rugby is a tradition.
In other words, former private boys.
They come from very different backgrounds than rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So misogynistic jokes are acceptable?
It's like my college rugby club, I've never seen racist behavior, but naked racing across campus, theft, property damage and misogyny were all part of the game.
- Not at all.
I'm sorry I didn't mention that in my last comment.
You can see it differently: you say that your own body itself is made up of parts of this ancestral water.
I'll get some peace.
So this interstellar cloud is also ancestral (yes, not traditional:))
@lux You didn't read the article right: a small half of the water in your pastis is over 4.6 billion years old...
Yeah, well, you can still consider that the pasta fleet is easily over 2.3 billion years old on average, which is not so bad already.
A damn nose to catastrophic and warming proponents of all kinds who predict the end of oceans and water resources, when that water has always existed.
This is irrefutable evidence that warming stopped 20 years ago (see Serge Ferry's remarkable work funded by Total and Areva).
@manon troppo: What is the proof that warming has stopped?
I don't see the connection.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Uh, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a sign?
So you don't understand much about environmental issues.
The problem is not that the catastrophic scientists, as you say, are concerned about the disappearance of the oceans, but rather about the reduction of human consumption of water (you know, fresh water, which accounts for less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And more generally, it is not global warming that is most threatening to our species but above all the reduction in the few or no renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly voracious lifestyles.
As for the study you cite and the generous effort you make to cite the source, the truth of the conclusion is naturally not in doubt.
The French are far from concerned with freshwater problems. Secondly, we must stop thinking of ecology as a dogma without fault. The hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimation of 100% by 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, ecology religiously dogmatic and irrational, no thanks.
 Then we must stop thinking of ecology as a flawless dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is quietly closing  Yes, it is not as if it were a spontaneous movement that would come out of nowhere.
@martin: I just want to specify that global warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our earth will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of oxygen will capture heat without releasing it and which in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct action so far?
Or any sign that 10,000 good men would have come out into the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, whatever it is?
I 'm sure not !
In Abbott's little brain, maybe sending the RAAF to the Middle East is his version of a direct action.
We're moving backwards, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this village idiot?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% more CO2 than any permitted climate model give priority to replanting.
This makes no sense, since CO2 is the most abundant plant food in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora worldwide.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been flattened.
Have you seen the Green Army anywhere?
Do nothing, dear government.
CO2 levels are rising from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument about plant food is just a misleading distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms Wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulfur.
The most abundant of the biologically produced materials may be carbon, but that doesn't mean it's the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is misleading and deserves ridicule.
Direct action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
The budget for LandCare has been severely cut and that money is now being spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most profitable, it's now investing where it will get the most publicity to get the Liberals back to the marginal electorate.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, brave champion.
SilverHead, when there's too much CO2 in the air, plants do less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and humans must eat them in much larger quantities to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
That this member is childish is obvious.
So far, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from deviating from the rules of the 17th century.
However, sanctioning him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible to many people, even if the AN regulation is not a tax treaty.
That this lady is making a whole deal about it is not in her honor, it seems mostly hysterical.
If Mitterrand had fined everyone who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the Academy was offended: "let's say Mrs. Keeper or Seal Keeper" (a position which until then had never been held by a woman).
It 's just machismo .
The political arena.
The sandbox, the backyard of the Republic is filled with the marmot of operetta, the table of illusions, etc...
But the arena involves gladiators, people who take real risks, willingly or unwillingly.
When the Falconian Umpist sits on the label and the parliamentary regulations by distorting the elementary civility under the false umbrella of good manners, the punishment is applied to him as a 'quality' for his partisan stubbornness and misuse of the political arena.
The Member's conduct is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's provoking to get people talking about him.
Until now it was unknown, now it can boast of being known as is known any cancer of a primary class.
The academy is back on its feet and we can see that the members are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to work to solve its internal problems and stop causing the couacs and scandals.
The Academy is on the back of the head, especially when you make it say what it doesn't say.
This Member is acting like a college student in the midst of a teenage crisis, who is provocative and whose friends are going to the Principal as a delegation to cancel the school's school hours.
And defending it on a text they haven't even read!
Women are not even 15% of the signatories to this UMP platform.
Your Honor, I'm calling on two expert witnesses who are a few thousand years apart.
That's why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, otters, horses, they all do stupid things just for the pleasure of it.
On the contrary, it seems that we spend most of our 80 years working, moving and shopping.
What a strange stage we have reached - we are able to double our life span, but we spend most of it in boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion of anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
In addition, the  communication  necessarily implies a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right, I'm not.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play basic body language.
After that, there's a variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to be picked up, etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism  although I do agree that we hear a lot of bullshit about animals that are  playing  when they're just communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just  useful  (it may be, or it may not be), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that there is a principle of play at the basis of all physical reality.
If he had learned in school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her. Maybe yes, hope makes life...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the chance to live, to be healthy and to be able to respond today to an article when you were supposed to drink the news and not be able to respond just 15 years ago.
I'm not generally against ideas, and I'd even tend to be quite enthusiastic about ideas that seem crazy at first.
But when you look at what many have learned from their schooling, especially among the most likely audience to engage in violence against women, my enthusiasm is not the least of an anchor point.
 the public most likely to engage in violence against women  We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's good, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always smell like pink, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thought patterns.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
The young people of Evry are also broke!
If the reactions were to stop, Twitter would no longer offer to follow Le Pen and Sarko as first choice.
I didn't learn anything about it at school and I never raped anyone (and it's not my intention).
Do I have to consider myself lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values...
The family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do you start reading life if you can 't read ?
And are young socialists going to suburban schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than making moral tweets, but you'd have to get out of nice neighborhoods...
This campaign is grotesque.
They're all nuts everywhere, but to teach moral lessons, they're still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I still want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke about using his bread.
This week's article is not about that.
This is no time for bread jokes, my boy!
A little sensitivity !
You made a double-entry pun with the word  naan  to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that ?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old old woman in a nursing home.
How come the more you pay, the less you get in the plate?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured by weight or number of calories, just as the quality of a film or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that wouldn 't even satisfy a bird ?
It doesn't make sense, and it's just a deliberate policy designed to get you to buy more food.
Of course, it must not be that way.
The Sportsman at Seasalter is at least a very, very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini-dishes.
The more you pay, the more likely you are to get a child's portion of artwork in your plate.
At least they made an effort to put in the bottom.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on earth where you can taste good food?
Is the Manifesto for All just a Catholic and Muslim movement?
Yes, that's right: a kind of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "making children".
A child must not be raised on a battery farm or manufactured with technological equipment.
Battery farm ?
Where did you get that?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in manufacturing, you have to demand the WFP ban on heterosexual couples, which would be consistent.
I am surprised that the so-called 'for all' manifesto has not yet made such a logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
It is true that it is not only the Catholics who are manifesting.
It is still useful to remember that these different churches have ALWAYS been opposed to all changes in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann, a bishop, Mr Dupanloup, was violently rebelling against the GvT's desire to admit girls to school in the name of "the defence of the family".
We're still in the same pattern.
And more recently, the same currents have shouted at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of families when school became mixed.
I mean, the credit that can be given to these people's positions.
You don't have to be a catho to get angry about the commercialisation of belly and babies...
All this is in the line of decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
To me, freedom rests with the freedom of others: yes, with the recognition of same-sex couples who have the same right to love each other as others.
But we cannot tolerate the child being a movable object.
And this is also true for straight people looking for GPAs.
I just can't love this guy, or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and could avoid moments of wild stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
Besides, I'm sure any other striker, except Heskey, who plays as many games for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article is about the goals he scored, I'm not going to talk about the other things he brings, especially at ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't bring or don't bring anything), but maybe that would be another reason why he won was selected much more often than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12:48 Recommend 119 It's fashionable to criticize Rooney right now so we can forgive you for doing it too.
That said, it's good to note that since signing with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive passes in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and 32 deciding passes in 96 games.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to take on our Wazza because his stats on the field are excellent.
And, by the way,  Wazza  is a good reason to ridicule him.
I'm forced to wonder if you're really watching football or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many picks as Rooney and B) would score as many goals if he had so many picks.
I really don't understand where the criticism comes from about Rooney's abilities as a footballer.
The hardest part is being regularly selected for the national team for 13 years, and then continuing...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's footballing qualities (even not as a striker) to those of Peter Crouch?
You're not kidding me?
There are really people out there who are completely outnumbered.
Please also note for your sake that Rooney was not always England's leading goal scorer during his England career.
Instead, he played the retired frontman, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He has played behind players such as Michael Owen, the aforementioned Mr Crouch, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that as a joke.
In a country where gun ownership is tolerated and in a state where 71 percent of people own a gun, I find it totally schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
And those in this school just don't agree with the US gun-carrying permits at all!
Using a pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the crap, the girl's five.
How many kids play with fake guns at this age in our house?
Does that make them powerful killers?
Even though the US Constitution includes the right to bear arms and it necessarily affects the culture of the country, I don't think that rich children are any different from us.
A little common sense and a little common sense.
This is a disarming process!
Surrender yourself surrounded!
The information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has, or does not have, the taste of morbid first fruits.
Can we assume that a serial killer can't behave strangely at the age of five?
If people need psychological follow-up, it's the school's mobs more than the students!
Get the parents out of there , she 's in danger !
I totally agree.
The school's staff are obviously completely sick.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the US but it is part of it.
What a misunderstood country!
His relative youth?
These shiny blue ribbons that men wear are nothing like a contractor!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wear early in their careers?
In their first pictures, Lord Sugar was wearing a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson was wearing a folded collar sweater.
I can't comment too much since I've never seen this before, but it all sounds so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Maybe not?
But how depressing that sounds!
You've been ahead of me.
I would have thought a small knowledge of English would be an asset for business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by "ostracize" he meant "alienate".
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracising still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a gray suit, we could argue that their intention was to ostracize her.
But not here.
It looks like it's been fixed, oddly. Maybe the whole sentence was invented!
It's not weird.
haha, who knows what he might have said?
I'm sure nothing, but someone definitely wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well ostracising, which meant absolutely nothing.
The rate of death in the United States fell again in August, at about 6%.
I haven't seen him since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in every state.
The American economy, with Obama, is continually strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Is their economy becoming "sustainable"?
To live in the moment, I would say that the United States is getting closer to the explosion as inequality goes crazy.
The political system is literally ruined by the state of campaign finance.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration are on a scale unimaginable in Europe but Americans remain incredibly optimistic about their country's future and theirs!
How long?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, the British financial community said France was lost.
Now America is at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of those articles that just forgets the basics.
The level of consumption in the US economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards will not be able to pay the change for a long time...
The Commission has also been consulted on the following issues:
And the weakest and poorest, the vast majority of citizens, will inevitably "drink" or morph.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will Labour finally realize that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing sympathetic voters from abroad is losing even more support at home?
I guess not.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any cost.
LOL, it was to please our American masters and their Cold War with Russia continues.
A shameful performance by Labour, Ed Milliband is in the mix, it's 617 votes.
As for Clacton, 11 percent for Labour, shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that the Blair government's massive immigration policy was designed to put the right's nose in diversity
Labour wins the by-election, the Tories lose the by-election in a safe seat against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you spoken about your struggle against reality with a therapist?
I imagine it's the same multiculturalism that's driving this turn of the crank, the crank has been going a long way since the end of the war, and I imagine it's going to go back the other way.
Have you talked to a therapist about your struggle with reality?
Lol - Labour's safe seat, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing, Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows that.
I'm sure the Tories have seen worse, but Labour is victorious in Pyrrhus.
Look for the word  Victory  in any context, and you'll see that when used arguably against the word  Defeat , it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but she's skinny.
Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like this in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I don't care who wins in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems aren't here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia stupidly hard.
But I wonder if the alignment of Venus and Mars etc. should not be considered too?
In general, you have to see the Earth more pasty or malleable than you can imagine.
Is that right?
A few little puzzles.
On the other hand Wylie tells us of a rather simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth's crust, the pressure on the mantle relaxes, which would give a) a whiff at the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface.
In any case either the whip or the facilitation of access to the surface will be (more or less) located.
It is difficult to distinguish between the cause of the effect and vice versa. As regards global warming, I think it is prudent to focus on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very amicably, dear Father, does this volcanic activity have an effect on our environment?
Does it affect our future or past global warming?
Is it not prudent to keep warm?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, you can't see much.
The end of the last ice age was also accompanied by stronger seismic activity, particularly in the active mountain ranges (Canada, Scandinavia) where the mainland is very busy.
Heartfelt CB
Too often it is not known that the earth's crust floats on the magma and that the moon's single passage causes it to rise or fall by about 30 to 60 centimeters, differing in its passage to the zenith, as it does for ocean waters.
This makes the melting of the tectonic plates, like the tides, more or less facilitated by this moving hump, especially since the polar ice sheets are lightened by melting ice, which causes a change in the earth's equatorial balance, since the earth's volume remains constant.
I am amused that this man, calling himself the supreme commander of Nature and his self-proclaimed patron commander, mocks himself by his stupid action on the environment that created him and from which he has become so separated that it has become harmful to himself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature which surpasses him in the organization of his own viscera, by an invention which consists in finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, each other, mocking collaboration, money.
The earth's crust is not based on magma but on the earth's mantle, which is made up of solid rock.
Personally, I find it impossible to look at.
Pride and arrogance.
It reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
I'm looking forward to the next part.
♪ It 's a beautiful story ♪
It reminds me of a totally cool 2002 series called Ape-man.
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers it now.
It's a shame you never missed the first impression.
Your loss...
The glaciers, our distant ancestors, you should look at this passage again.

I'm pretty sure that the documentary  History of Humanity  has been made several times already, they still go to Ethiopia (obviously)
Oh, I can't stand this guy, Brian Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to be a faggot in front of a brain in a jar.
And his story...
This must be hard for you, having to watch Coxy.
It says there may be a support group for you.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the show, it was beautifully filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass ?
Indeed, it is the individualistic identity that prevails today.
It therefore requires being self, self, therefore nonconforming.
But Descartes was also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But then it was just the premises that were appearing, today individualism is structuring the whole society, educated or not, cultured or not, rich or poor...
We are in the "mass" individualism!!
Without making it an unbridgeable horizon, is there not some relation to the Cartesian approach of examining what one is accepted to believe, what one believes in oneself?
More than rebellion, doubt is fertile.
To make Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many liberal xxx-liberals refer to it and demand it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform !
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid navel, he blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of insanity.
And it brought the most reductive and reactionary view that ever existed: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and being anti-conformist is to fight this discovery.
Marcel Gauchet is accused of being a law enforcement official.
That 's a great idea .
Be beautiful and rebellious, one might ask...
Black and rebel, to the others.
Beauties and robots, including the most following of those who look back in their mirror.
At least thanks to his controversial opponents for putting Marcel Gauchet, this patient, persistent and pedagogically enlightening humanist, under the spotlight.
David Cameron supports raising the inheritance tax threshold
How many more budget cuts will be needed to pay for this rich person's benefits?
Dave the robot will certainly increase his net worth once he's out of power.
Business advice, allowances, consultation fees, a series of best-selling books written by a nigger about serious politics, it'll be worth £100 once he's passed the gun to the left.
Of course, he does not want an inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as last election?
And the richest are the ones who will most likely pay the least inheritance taxes thanks to super-high-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining empire where heritage kills innovation.
It'll be worth £100 once he's past the gun on the left.
I mean, anything.
He's probably gonna promise to raise the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say it's worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think Brown was only thinking of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we had a coalition instead.
You couldn't afford to accuse him of lying unless he was actually elected to power.
Like the rest of us, Dave will not die normally.
Climate change and the impending collapse will end him and the others in his doom.
His wealth shall be no more than the wealth of the world; neither shall he save himself nor his children.
Non-taxable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where the government debt has exceeded £1,000,000,000,000.
We all have to be taxed to pay for essential services and pay off the debt.
I agree with you, Exdionys.
I am not saying that discipline teaching is useless, of course, I am just saying that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "insufficiencies".
That's a very unreasonable statement for the math teacher she was!
What do you mean?
Better recruitment and better training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
The French political class has no other approach than quantitative.
There are two possible answers, the first would be to select teachers according to their ability to pass on knowledge => reform of recruitment procedures.
De, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
She does not understand them and does not know how to act or react to work well. She is reduced to establishing a relationship of mistrust that causes everyone to suffer a loss.
It's a skill you learn.
But education is above all an art, a natural disposition and vocation before it is a technique.
Working with and on humans is not like making automotive parts.
Education doesn't even come into play when you're a math teacher!
The "science of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural ability.
What is lacking at present is a real vocation among those who embrace the profession.
If there are gifts, education (I prefer discipline teaching) allows those who are less comfortable not to make mistakes.
There are ways to approach a question more effectively.
The real unknown today is the students, one third of whom tell us that learning is useless.
A Slate article describes the chaotic situation of this new year quite well.
Let's just regret the old Normal Schools of Instructors.
It ends at 3 a.m. starting this week, but it starts at midnight.
If it does, it's still in his schedule.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It's not my place!
It's been years since her show started at midnight.
We have this thing called iplayer that lets us listen to shows on demand whenever we want!
The internet is pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at home, I can't really listen to radio shows either.
I have a USB adapter on the back of my Sky box and it's connected to the Internet, but listening to the radio on my TV seems too complicated.
Yeah, I think I got the timing wrong, I had to hear from Richard Lester at about 3:00.
Although it's men in the daytime on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman on her airtime schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, that would at least please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Her show is all sensational stuff disguised as debate, and it would be much better on a channel like LBC.
The lack of female DJs during the day, where none of the regular hosts, from Chris Evans in the morning to Simon May's show in the evening after work, is a woman.
It's five shows.
So which one of these five is most likely to be changed.
Shennan knows that very well, but he's not saying anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached guy these days.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the office as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the air of a Daily Mail radio cold.
I imagine he's calm, waiting for the current team to get tired of it or get fired.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for the FN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties alternating in power and making the keys to the country worse off than they took it.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
You have to travel miles to find a movie theater, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't deal, they don't interest politicians...
But please don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yeah, Doclocal, they're sub-men, sociology is good at looking at them.
They also have a very high rate of early absenteeism and alcoholism.
The FN thrives on human stupidity, inculture and ignorance, and if it still has a huge growth potential, it must be bad for not doing better...
Today, the FN thrives mainly on poverty, fear of everyday life, fear of others and the feeling of having no prospects.
But you're right!
What a pathetic humanity.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, smart, educated and educated to save the honor.
They've been looking for him.

This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen listen - you can't just add and mix, women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries, existing norms are being challenged, like childcare and social and reproductive roles.
This is a recognition that women can work in the economic sphere and it is super - it is necessary.
But this cannot be done without acknowledging that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfill their social and reproductive role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize the roles of the sexes.
Money speaks, and if one sex doesn't match, the next!
Profit makes fun of the life you lead.
What do you do, what's the advantage and what do you have to offer?
Profit is mocking heroism and child rearing.
If it was a crime, the companies would listen.
Employers will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
My sister said it.
It is very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is done by women) must be equal to more than 50% of GDP.
Unpaid social work is not supported enough and undervalued (not to mention not being done enough by men), but it helps to run our societies and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also a major reason why many women are unable to find true  economic emancipation  outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to Mskayadee's point, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities women assume when conducting gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it'll be a big help to people who need to check a box.
The tiger is not Russian. It's just Western propaganda.
The Chinese are solely responsible for the current situation and they should be better off sitting at the negotiating table.
The right to self-determination of the tiger and the Russian soldiers are simply exercising near the border, exercises planned long before the current situation.
Besides, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missile in his possession.
Release the Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, here.
He immediately came up with the same kind of idea.
This is a perfectly fitting pretext to arm some separatists with the aim of annexing China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, then China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article about a tiger, a beautiful and endangered feline, turn into a piece that is being blamed on Putin?
What's he doing in there?
So this is not a leaflet about the Siberian tiger, but a leaflet about the aftermath of a Putin operation.
When we are exposed to so much media, we are also exposed to irony and even criticism.
The perpetual cycle of victimization of Soviet-Putin sympathizers.
Hollande had also taken the pear with his camel without shouting at the anti-French plot.
There our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the patron saint of Great Russia, was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
At least the tiger understood everything, he's barking up the wrong tree.
Holland getting bashed is one thing.
At first glance, this seems like a horribly condescending idea.
But based on the article, it seems that it is both a solution to a real problem - emergency dental grants - and effective.
So it's hard to find anything to blame.
And if only 53 percent of that sample brushed their teeth before, and 73 percent after, it's a little pointless to complain about paternalism.
After all, there's no harm in brushing your teeth!
Indeed - at bottom, the complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted at the unemployed and this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it turns out to be accurate, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said the ministry was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants being offered by the Ministry of Social Development's Department of Labour and Revenue to unemployed young adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a downside to brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and stiff, it can bite the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember a Guinness Book of Records show where someone tried to brush their teeth the longest and the Guinness judges at the time had strongly advised him not to do so because of the harmful effects of frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
'at first sight' - very funny.
I think this is a rotten experimental design.
The mere fact that you volunteered for this study would change the habits of the participants who knew that toothbrushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioral studies include things like double blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to dismiss these results on the programme itself.
Assuming these texts are sent to every young person who perceives social benefits, there are two things that distinguish this from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they don't give feedback about when they brush or don't brush their teeth (results easily scratched by people who give their results based on perceived expectations).
Are there any epigenetic consequences?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the womb) may have an effect on genetic inheritance, not in the genome, but in gene expression, and that these inherited traits can be passed on to the next generation.
Does a uterine transplant affect this?
The nesting itself looks like a kind of transplant.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we don't want to produce an impossible perfect clone of ourselves, is that a priori a problem?
It seems to me to be going beyond the bounds of reason.
The desire to be a mother and father should not lead to ever going further, without raising the question of ethics, risk-taking, for the mother and her baby.
Not all medicine is powerful, not all medicine is limitless, and yes it is unhappy and painful to accept that not all women will have it, or the children they desire.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the tran
But let men, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to the point of taking risks and manage your little testicles to yourself, to yourself in your little pants to yourself.
I'm going to "trust" them this magic bag so they can have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him sterile in my safe if he can still give love.
The current narrow circumstances make PR FRYDMAN cautious about his communication, but if we agreed to reflect, we would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
What would you say as an anti-argument: see here all these reactions curiously male....
Marjane, every organ donation is nothing short of anodine.
I've been a plasma donor for years, and it's not totally innocuous.
I was registered as a spinal cord donor (I was never selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understandable to both the recipient and the donor), this is a real operation.
Now as a man, I wouldn't allow myself to judge in one way or another or take part in this gift, but I would listen to women talk about it.
@Margane: Indeed, it's not an uncommon thing, and it reinforces the act of love that it involves.
Giving a kidney to a family member in need is no small feat, and it is done!
Please, no matches between Messi and Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Especially since there's no real competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Deportivo has become a yo-yo club.
They're too good for Segunda, but they don't have the standard of the Liga.
Rivaldo was not part of the title-winning team.
Thanks for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for Deportivo before he went to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything he can to beat all Real Madrid's goals this season so he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a clear conscience...
I can't believe this.
I think Ronaldo will end his career at Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you're talking about the International Oil Investment Company Stadium?
I was looking at him on a shit connection so I can't tell you much about it except that Valencia defended well and not counting possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the midfielder would get past too quickly, but they played well.
Parejo's game is getting better overall.
A terrible penalty for cowardice claimed but rightly saved by Diego.
A bustling Mestalla and it must not have been funny for the Atletico bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A full article, signed by the young researcher Amandine Marshall,  On the origins of mummification , well illustrated, appeared in the magazine Archéologia 524 last September.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what you intuitively guess.
No wonder we made it simple before it got complicated.
All science is progressing in small steps.
And what was the body of the woman that was preserved?
That 's exciting .
Hello, and thank you for your tickets.
I had read some time ago that a mummy of a black child had been discovered in what is now Libya and that this discovery opened up new horizons, including geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mummy was 1000 years before the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
She's a little bit of a nuisance to reading.

Wasn't the desert less distant then than it is now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis growing where there's only sand now?
We know the song.
And it is enough for a European scientist to say it, even without any proof, to make it a scientific truth: the Egyptians and, therefore, the Africans of yesterday and today never invented anything in their own country.
But the song doesn't tell us who invented African inventions in Africa.
If not, and always  from his predecessors  little known.
You should read the article.
This is an article written by free market neoliberal quacks who preach against the movement of people and for the movement of goods.
I think there are other people with Ebola and the Spanish government is lying to us about them, so they don't give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last concern.
But they might keep quiet to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the UK) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than the interests of individuals.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, useless and corrupt, like Madrid is not a very tourist destination, I doubt that's their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads above water, I would say yes, it's important.
If they were to repatriate the missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't have sent them to an air force base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatising the nationalized hospitals, especially in Madrid, which is his power base, until the courts intervene.
He's just a right-wing PR guy like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's screwed up in the next election.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he's far to his right and would find his place with the right-wing religious lunatics in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had before he went down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I apologize, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European right-wing party to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish government lies about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like anyone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to back up that idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting labour at the centre of production and economy with its rights and guarantees, we cannot get away with it.
Great article , but most of all , fascinating reactions on the forum .
Many employers of small and medium-sized enterprises seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn the comments of Pr.
Let's move on to the anti-intellectualism of the environmental era.
A professor of law at the Collège de France seems unable to know the labour market unless he is a Nobel Prize winner in economics and proposes to liberalise it completely
It was so much better before, it's true when Dr. Villermé saw eight-year-olds working 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were being shot in sight because of a signed collective bargaining agreement.
Ah, the good old days...
Your reaction is just as fascinating because you don 't know the job of head of TPE !
His job is not to know the law in all his orders, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten copies of my youth payroll, over 100 pieces of information today!
Here is an example, one that could be cited much more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed by immeasurable consequences, and which stifle small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbonne client.
To twist the archetypal argument of the French Labour Code's thickness over the harvest, a serious academic would have dived into the Swiss texts and compared the amount of official texts and then the amount of commentary (the absence of the latter could mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
The comments in a Code, whether work or not, are aimed at the case law in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is in charge of enforcing the laws when an employee is fired, for example....
Who's got this complicated?
Do you think that the rules of law (laws, case law, conventions, contracts) in the field of labour and trade are unbearable obstacles?
What's he doing?
How long does this take?
Pullmann  Art has practically been immune from criticism.
Is this guy still in fashion?
It is certainly time for new revolutionary absurdities to turn the tide on critics...
For every Ai Weiwei article I've read recently, you're one of the first three comments complaining about its popularity.
Go on , move on !
Go see somewhere else. There's no shortage of choice in the art world.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokesmen for the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a Chinese government troll.
I think China has produced many good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen for the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei's art is some kind of fraud, here's what you're missing.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but I had to expose it at all costs (without misplacing the word).
He's the guy who smashes old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There's art, and then there's vandalism trying to get attention.

KARSENTY DEMISSION this gentleman is unworthy to hold an elected term extremists of all stripes (including Zionists) must be thrown aside
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have resulted in him being convicted of several crimes, are a disgrace to both Israel and the city of Neuilly.
It's not either.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting the truth alone, on the margins.
Who looks like he's coming
What is the Mayor of Neuilly going to do about Philipe Karsenty, who is hurting a journalist and his family and publicly calling for an attack on this urban planner?
Crime apology ?
I can't find Neuilly on my map?
Is this a new administration that holds these new privileges ???
This guy needs care, just like Ulcan Chelli, they're both in the anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy theory and their outcomes are exactly the same as those of their most angry critics.
Just as many people believe that political decisions are taken by the hands of the Zionists (a term whose meaning tends to disappear due to its abuse), these two, like the LDJ or the CRIF, believe that in any criticism, even banal, they see an abject anti-Semitism which is reminiscent of the darkest hours of our history because it is still fertile in the belly of the beast.
It's worth noting that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin's reporting are even more stupid than those about 9/11.
And God knows the 9/11 conspiracy theories are just so dirty.
And this guy has political responsibilities, which is extremely worrying.
To make my analogy with the 9/11 conspiracy theory clearer, we're talking about cognitive dissonance about how to approach the subject.
He is completely blinded by a totally vague truth, having spent too much time, too much money to support it, and it is intolerable for the adept of this theory to detach himself (as in the case of religious extremists).
The logic and inevitable leakage of the results justifies all means, even the lie, which is a complete but not seemingly disruptive task.
You're advising us to be careful not to put everyone in one basket, but that's what you're doing for 9/11.
There are still a lot of unanswered questions about this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudi/consortia don't seem to be in a hurry to answer them.
There are indeed very far-fetched theories, but the official theory is also, at least on some points.
Oh, nothing is funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find the results of the study to be largely in favour of their awareness raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more grants to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also have its hour of judgment when the real damage it causes to our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like, "Overconsumption of alcohol is on the rise", but what takes (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I 'm sorry if you think this is an attack - go get a drink and relax ?
Better to risk that than to put my mental health at risk by abstaining.
The government ends pleasure when it costs money.
Here are some other alarmist tips based on unreliable statistics.
Two average glasses a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second suggests that it's a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should consult (about one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether justified or not.
Now we're gonna tax them like smokers!
They're already doing it - soon it'll be the grass!
My father didn't drink or smoke, and he died of cancer at 64.
So I'm going to keep drinking my two bottles of red on Friday and Saturday nights (and the other nights when my wife's not here).
Why the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is served is an old news item that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What's not linked to a cancer risk these days ???
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring theme for many years.
Don't run when we can run and run each other.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessed yes.
They both destroyed our F1 under the guise of safety.
Let's hope he does better than Schumi or worse than Wendlinger after his accident in 1994.
I totally agree with you, but beware of point number one: it's not F1 but the circuit authorities who refused to go ahead so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Exactly, +1
I just wish Jules Bianchi a speedy and speedy recovery!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the near-accidents between the crane and the f1 were a free warning.
We knew it would happen one day, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had said it for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the FIA allow these maneuvers without getting the safety car out?
I cannot accept that the risks of the trade or the fault of chance are invoked when the foreseeable is not prevented.
But that accident was.
It is also worth mentioning that there was a yellow flag, which not only means 'no crossing' but is intended to signal danger.
It's not a shame, it's a good thing for the family to be in front of the TV.
Even under a yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more difficult the next turn and the driver, believing he can arrive with enough margin, may even be driven at a reduced speed than normal.
But, well, we're talking in the vacuum, until we see the pictures, we can't issue a written opinion.
I don't see much of a change in that.
Are there any wounded ?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the news this morning before this happened, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there are still jobs where you have to be on call 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are any people injured since Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals like bears, raccoons, etc.
I hope it's ironic.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population densities in North America, and the Toronto metropolitan area has at least six million inhabitants.
In rural Saskatchewan, trains do not go off as if by magic, and these types of trains often pass through populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains run very, very often in one day.
In addition, as roads often follow streams in areas where there are lakes, rivers, or oceans, they also pass through densely populated areas, because people always want to live near water.
Also, all rail traffic passes through the center of a city since this was a central part of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there's a huge potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a report on this last night, really shocking.
You obviously didn't read the article about the derailment and explosion of a train in a Quebec city that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
Vancouver was a port city long before the railroad.
That said, when the railroads were built, they passed through the center of established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Employees of the National Railway Company of Canada may be expected to attend the next Conference on Dangerous Goods in Calgary, Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.

This article and many other commentaries overlook the fundamental religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there can be no other truth.
The whole problem is here, and the exegesis of theologians only reinforces this fact, otherwise what good is it to talk about angels' sex?
"God said, it's good - it's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in some way trying to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cult: the strong euro (which is rather sluggish at the moment) or the free market (which is very much supported by the state when it has to be rebuilt), etc.
Great ideas from religious origins.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and secular.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is on the tractor and expresses itself in schism.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the state, and gods put at the service of ambition even though it also carried forms of defiance.
The theology torn between faithfulness to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time is beyond doubt.
Fanaticism is often described as a misinterpretation of "sacred texts".
This is not against the examination of the scriptures which are full of clear call to hatred by the disbelievers.
Rather, it is the moderate religious (and fortunately the majority) who "wrongly read" the texts and retain only what is humanistic and values common to all mankind, atheists and believers alike.
I think fanaticism is the stupid and mean application of passages from sacred texts that are taken out of context.
Thus, certain verses of the Quran calling for the killing of "unbelievers", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable unless one reads a few verses above or below stating that such executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a position of legitimate defense.
I think that the Commission is very much aware of the need to make a decision on the basis of the present proposal.
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive thing about this is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same damage as the one shown in the video?
A bunch of overpaid, oversexed Neanderthals.
They've insulted humanity enough!
What did they honestly bring us besides insulting us with Neighbors, For Life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Tasmanian Devil and that damn Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you took your eyes off the TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with cave paintings and stone paintings by its indigenous peoples and still being an inspiration to modern artists today.
And then there's the Sydney Opera House and a national opera company that has produced wonderful singers like Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema has produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealander, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me take a different view.

Almost all of the 331 dead since the ceasefire are Donbass civilians who have been bombed by the army, due to uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the responsibilities hypocritically suggested in the article without even daring to explicitly designate the separatists is in the Otani line of the World who does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European neo-Nazi Gentiles courageously confronting the bad Russians

Excerpt from the (very long) document you cite about MH17: "this note is not intended to say that pro-Donetsk resistance fighters are innocent at all".
The Russian Defense Minister says Ukraine is responsible.

And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, by contrast.
I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the ruling power who has not stopped denigrating Romanian football to the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the  Coperativa , which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which laundered money at will, mainly by selling players who were well underrated.
Gica Popescu, the former Barcelona captain, was doing business with the aforementioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was misadvised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes in court (which would have earned him an unpunished sentence), and consequently spent three and a half years in prison.
The trial also resulted in the imprisonment of the Becali brothers, four club owners, Steaua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for football-related offenses.
George Becali is also serving a sentence for trying to bribe (and then conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the championship, so they can win the title and win the Champions League jackpot.
The team he tried to bribe was our Cluj neighbors, Universitatea.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I still enjoy this moment as much.
Among others, Piturca was involved in concealing the corruption attempt, who signed as a witness a false document that implied that the money that the police confiscated in Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this poor, uneducated, stupid, cheating, lying guy doesn't represent me, and he never will.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist idiots these days.
You might think that after the last time they broke stadium chairs and store windows, and where they hung racist banners in the streets they couldn't have tickets this time, but no.

If Sarkozy had done this, we'd have heard the left scream like a big sick woman.
But as Mr Hollande, a friend of the trade unions and the small people, says, we can hear a little protest, but very low.
This is why economic circles sometimes prefer a left-wing party to take power.
It's the bankers who financed Obama's victory, and they haven't given up their investment!

Should the Employment Office widen the scope of unemployment controls in early 2015?
I hope that in the future the tax authorities will also widen their absolute control over the so-called plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasionists, thieving bosses and other thugs.
Can you put a sentence without the words banksters or plutocrats?
You seem very proud of your jargon every time
That's true when you have class: you treat the population as illiterate and toothless
Every new period of unemployment, I send dozens and dozens of applications to employers who most often do not even claim a receipt, it was automated.
This is also the total absence of monitoring or support from the Employment Pole.
In conclusion, I would add that the name  socialist  of this government seems to insult the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read an article about the chained duck here?
It is learned that an unemployed person may remain uninformed for several months, but must continue to seek employment on his own.
The controls have led to the dismissal of more than half of those who were no longer receiving unemployment benefits.
So we wonder how we can control people we never see.
The question is what is the penalty for firing someone who has no access to either job-sector services or unemployment benefits.
And if we can admit that this reform will lead to more redundancies, we wonder how it will help recruitment.
 It is learned that an unemployed person may remain uninformed for several months, but must continue to look for jobs on his own.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Isn't it as if the Spanish or Italian authorities have done a lot about racism in football, too?
Should we expel them from the EU?
The EU was originally only economic and should remain so.
The point is not to be a  thought police .
The EU is a peaceful project.
It makes no sense economically.
This is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality ???
The teams in Eastern Europe are constantly being fooled by the corrupt mafia referee UEFA.
The best solution would be for the whole East to leave this rotten, lucrative organization and create its own.
At least we'll finally be watching football.
This crusade against racism is just a screen to cover up injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
So what the hell is it with Europe to let the UK in?
UEFA should applaud them for playing Blatter and his men.
It's been happening everywhere for a few years now, and I'm not exaggerating.
From the Guardian two or three days ago:
Was he hoping to be retorted with small, symmetrical sentences, just a story to keep the controversy going?
However, it is a fact that every little peaceful event has been, has been and will be, people working hard to put oil on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that Western states are against a "Palestinian state", that they are pro-Israel, and that alone explains why these states have never done anything against the Israeli state.
The decoding would be to say that to solve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, we should act against the Israeli identity state, the armed Israeli occupying destroyer, the oppressor, the colonizer
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine at the expense of an Arab population that was not in the Holocaust, it would have been more reasonable to empty Bavaria of its German inhabitants (who were guilty of the Holocaust) and replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been justice, the Germans would have had nothing to demand and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic citizens.
Mr. Let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
That Morocco is colonialist is obvious!
But as with Israel, we must also examine history, its allies and supporters to see the truth.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
So stop your pirates and support Israel as a settler.
Gaul was colonized by the Romans but now there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination based on origin.
The State of Israel is defined as a "Jewish people" of which no non-Jewish people can be a part.
The Israeli state discriminates against non-Jews, hence the controversy.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, we must break with Zionism, which is a conflict between Jews and non-Jews.
In the Maghreb, some people have even been baptized in the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities we must stop ignoring.
First, the European Zionist project (colonization and appropriation of Palestine) involved the dispossession of the Palestinians, so it was an inherently anti-Palestinian project, so the solution requires breaking with Zionism.
Secondly, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has been a bit too short to bite since the start.
Their dull result will give them something to bite their fingers with.
He should start his rehabilitation with small incisions.
I hope he hasn't lost his appetite for gambling.
We tolerate so much nonsense, including racial insults and physically tough tackles in football, but we punished Suarez too hard.
I'd like to see him back in England, no matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all those molar.
Football is a contact sport where tacks exist and yes, therefore, players will get hurt.
The idea of getting your teeth into the flesh of an opponent to gain an advantage certainly has no place in the game.
A rugby player was suspended for 80 games for making a similar gesture.
This is the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would you say would be the consequences?
I knew someone was gonna bite me.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually a little dyslexic.
I forgive that sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to coming back to play.
All these word games about Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost bit the bait.
A key condition for a good academic career is respect for teachers and the school.
This works if parents instill that respect in their children.
Parents are more likely to show respect when they feel respected by their children's teachers and school.
In good schools, parents who are promoting their students are seen as partners, not as em...
Who would think that the teacher should do all the work (teach, educate, learn respect, limitations, live together briefly) It's up to parents to do at least 50% of the work.
But it's probably easier to get into trouble at school.
Betting on parents is not working.
Nobody really took them down.
The action will therefore remain limited.
But the school could do a lot.
The operational solutions lie there.
Should the actors (professors, hierarchies and ministry) play their part and not always be involved?
We can disband a band that's been disbanded to revive it, not families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses are a great way to exchange money.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the primary role of the school.
To transmit knowledge.
And if parents are required, it is that the school provides their children with education.
What minister would dare to put in place what was called the Public Instruction?
Disappointing article: little information, partial and disorganized reflections.
You really expected a clever comment from this East Side cheater?
He's a beaver, obviously, but I think he's more of a Willoughby, and so the North Shore...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Drop it and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
It 's absolutely true
That's it, man.
A little Aloysius.
His constituency is the seat of North Sydney.
It's a North Coast whirlwind!
Well, if British BBC viewers want to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously conclude that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
He seems like a grumpy guy these days.
Yeah, but his leader leaves him on hunger strike regularly.
You'd be rather grumpy too if you woke up one morning and realized that you'd never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lifetime benefits, both legal and illegal, would be out of your reach forever.
Poor Joe.
It's really pathetic.
He tried to put in half a budget and then he gave up.
At least he doesn't threaten to hit someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She'll be able to command it without gas turbines in a faraway country and demand state aid.
And since she knows how to lobby, no fear of the outcome.
And what a shame for the jobs in France, which have nothing to do with it, which come from vegetables always ready to break down when their corporation has losses in the markets, especially outside...
It's just that their lobbying didn't work that the order was canceled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or a layout for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have been successful.
Then, to find out whether it's right or wrong and how BF will comply with the law after all, it would be nice if "the world" looked into it!
Brittany Ferries is owned by the Breton vegetable company.
The ones who burn down the tax and secu centers.
They want state aid.
I don't think it's normal for them to have one.
And since a French-flagged ship is 30 percent more expensive than any other civilised flag, yes, it is normal to expect a boost from the state.
Or we condemn ourselves to tolerate the British monopoly on the market.
It's up to you.
The French problem is that it considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as business areas, where people sometimes live differently from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid off every day, lack of investment, short-term envy.
One of the reasons Brittany must regain her sovereignty.
That's it, and after that they'll create the Breton Pavilion with crews made up exclusively of pure Breton strains.
With that, they're sure to cut costs significantly...
Of course you do.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They always hated everything about prog, so it's no surprise they chose to ignore Hackett's solo career, which was always closer to the spirit of the 70s Genesis than the rest of the band.
Hackett was to Genesis what Malcolm Young was to AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To be honest, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of hating everything about prog, since they just aired an hour and a half long documentary about one of the greatest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a movie about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career which would be closer to the Genesis spirit of the '70s, I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to drive, play a bunch of Genesis songs that he's had varying degrees of involvement in and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis than David Gilmour has the right to gather a bunch of half-finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait a minute.
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair performance, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely awesome, and quite in the spirit of Genesis of the '70s.
They've skipped Hackett's solo career because, to be honest, she's scared.
Yeah, it's one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been made if they hadn't had their commercial pop success in the '80s?
I've yet to see the BBC broadcast a long documentary about bands like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have an equally interesting history but lack the popular appeal that Genesis has.
That's a good point.
I would say, though, that the BBC has always hated the fact that it LOVES progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest screams  prejudice : of course.
A little bit more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD?
It's a very beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to replicate a horrible act with another horrible act (including sometimes against innocent people), then it is a resounding success.
There's always going to be a big difference between a murderer on death row and those who kill him.
The criminal committed his act because he misunderstood society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the viewpoint and thought of the most righteous and wise of a society.
I mean, they have no excuse.
They're defenseless.
Yeah, we understood your point of view the first time.
That's exactly where the difference lies, Mr. LeClos.
You have to have a very different mindset from the common mortal to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his misunderstanding of things.
But it also produces pain, hatred, and revenge in the loved ones of the innocent victim - a misunderstanding that those who wisely decide on the death of others from the sound and righteous reasoning of their childhood can never prevail over.
But to try to balance the analysis, one could still argue that the condemned person often used savage violence, which he could enjoy, against people who were basically kind and paid for it for free.
The families of these unfortunate victims may see their pain eased with the loss of the one who was the bully, sometimes the torturer, of their loved one and who haunted them at night.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thanks Emilio for this thought, which I think is very correct.
A powerful and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he is very intelligent.
The heart.
That's probably the most correct thing I've read in a long time.
But you'd think you'd be reading stories from another era, old things, that the barbarism of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that are falling apart, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
Same for the other two excellent American novelists cited here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all on the surface.
I thought you stopped the white, man.
What does that ring?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than that miserable Bellow, who got him the award.
Maybe this year's Nobel judges have decided that if we have to have an American winner, we could just as well have a [light] racist.
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce genius novels as if they were literary.
His namesake Joseph, on the other hand...
Which ones have you read?
How many books of DeLillo have the anti-DeLillo read?
I never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
The news like Human Moments in World War III?
White noise ?
The first light, crazier, smaller novels, and their dialogues, are great, too.
I don't know if I'll ever be able to finish Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough DeLillo books to reject his writing talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be conflict...???
It's just a matter of interest.
It was a sense of humor, a law, not a question of definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems so obvious that the lady acted in her own interest, and not in the interest of the institution she represented, that one wonders what the term conflict is doing there.
She didn't think there was any conflict.
I hope it costs a lot of money.
Yes, the State services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value or they have not warned of the danger.
We shall then learn that French workers are not dynamic and seek only tranquility.
Flood areas that become constructible overnight when a major construction programme is launched are classic, not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We've been told that nowadays, there are no more floods because of the regulatory dams.
Now we need to widen the retention lakes up and cross our fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
The profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
Get out of here.
So, six million euros.
Is it clearer, then, what the interest is?
Take out the calculator and you will dream of the life you could have had in the place of Mrs Babin, First Deputy UMP of La Faute sur Mer and former President of the Planning Commission, the building permitting body!
The two breasts of the triumphant Sarkozy are the old and the real estate.
I'm left-wing and not at all sympathetic to Sarko, but, uh, no political slump or any down-to-earth strikes, we're not in this stinking ball fight.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The cops in the US are hardened criminals.
The US is a shithole.
So, what the fuck are you living in?
The United States is not a shithole.
Yeah, the American cops are hardened because of the scum they deal with every day.
Of course none of them ever do anything but the cops come and fuck them up because they're racist.
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic in the US, and unfortunately it takes an incident like this to force people to look at the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a profound ignorance of the US...
You're ignorant of it here.
Good cops have to expose corrupt racist cops.
Sell them !
Do the math.
This kind of open racism doesn't exist here.
Is this the first time you 've been in a conversation ?
This is not a conversation, you accuse someone of ignorance when in fact it is clearly you who don't understand anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the US (it's not idle speculation).
You may very well underestimate the extent of the problem and not appreciate how much tension is rising about it right now.
And as a result, the never-so-robust boundary between public service and private security for power and privilege is becoming even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, which is why Occupy is being treated there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and I am shocked by the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think investigative journalists get their information?
On the Internet?
They're gonna question the people in charge, make them talk, raise confidentiality.
That Man goes to the Elysee is really nothing surprising.
Then what matters is the cross-section, the verification, the analysis.
And you can see that sarcophagi are a lot of trouble.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of anti-arkozymism based on a whole bunch of cases (no place and no conviction) that seem to have been fabricated by magistrates (reported in correctional form), two journalists friends of Hollande.
If you are not shocked by this conspiracy between justice, politics, the executive and the press, which is not supposed to be an organ of power, it is because your partisan mind is blinding you!
RV with Hollande ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not remote controlled!!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's supporters are outraged!
From the extract I was able to read, the VA article only waters the sprinkler.
I even laughed so hard it was rude.
The fact is that the World complaint is unlikely to succeed because journalists are not "strict" in secrecy, are they?
The difference is that there seems to be no collusion between VA and the government whereas there seems to be collusion between the government and the World Journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for the world to explain the background and its dangerous relationships.
We are facing a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
Hence this editorial, which is full of gossip about complicity with the current government.
It's not a question of left or right, it's more serious.
I thought the sausage would be fine with the smoked herring!
It's just for the numbers and to cut wages and create housing problems, I'm sure if I were a second-generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents came here I would have my doubts about immigration but that's not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people on a BBC immigration show was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people coming in and the changes they brought with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not cooperative at all, refusing even to give soup shams simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship even though she assured him that he was not obliged to pray.
** who said she was NOT comfortable 
As we all know, if we let it happen, the UK will continue to move to the right - anyone who imposes limits and challenges that should be admired even if it's an advertising executive 🙂 So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left-wing, it would be communist.
What do you think the New Labour party, which is particularly left-wing, has done?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS this repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrants (in their own terms to get the right nose in it), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-consent, the politically correct that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a centre-left party and not a communist party, I said that as a joke, and I mean that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I asked you to do are give specific examples of leftist politics, or a leftist program advocated by the New Labour government.
Can you do that ?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour party, which is particularly right-wing, had done.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked.
Yeah, this is more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising executive in the UK, associates his parents' situation with the economic migrants coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory !
He was absolutely right to do that.
France to the French!
If we beat 40-45 to fall into another discourse, that of money.
We'll save a lot of money by firing these technocrates...
I'll be told if we renegotiate the treaties.
It is a matter of renegotiation and if the word democracy still has meaning in Europe, should it not?
Strangely, the Commission does not look at unfair tax competition between countries with respect to companies.
That must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully commercial.
In the long term, this means that entire sections of French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment that many territories are already experiencing will only grow.
To sacrifice everything, including the advancement of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa does not seem like a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be dealt with someday.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to set the accounts of SNCF.
The French state has resigned a long time ago.
The regions feel that they are paying for nothing, but they have no means of forcing the SNCF to honour its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential in a time when public resources are limited.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see how the competition between the TERs could be very good.
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If he is, he certainly shouldn't be Chief Wolf?
It seems to me that you have not really been able to distinguish between the problems that existed during the marriage and that you are, naturally, still coping with the pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-drinker living so close to you and seemingly affecting your daily life is both annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would seem reasonable to me to begin the process of separating your life from the complications you have inherited.
It sounds like that's what they're doing, but it seems hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist as new ones emerge, have you thought about a plan to escape so you can make a cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a detrimental effect, but with a compassionate mortgage company, a good lawyer, and a little pressure from the court, they can be solved.
He seems vengeful and persistent.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group and open up and offer support to help them get back to work and pay alimony.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made up of a lot more than the time you spent with your ex.
That's very good advice.
My advice, ask the kids what they'd like to do, even if it means meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice, whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they would handle the disappointment if he did not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see that you're doing this for their own good, despite your own resentment about the way he treated you, they'll respect you.
They will never stop loving you, and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continuing parent-child relationship, they will know who to thank when they grow up.
I think children will eventually understand who's to blame if they're allowed to see things for themselves.
Go a little further and you're close to Godwin's point.
It's folded, in 30 to 40 years civilization will be gone, short-term economic interests are too powerful, it's pot pot pot against pot iron.
In addition, with globalisation the country which does at least socially, taxally and environmentally has an immediate competitive advantage, and others are forced to follow suit.
All politicians want is growth, growth.
We'll need international coordination, but by then...
It's not climate skeptics that produce CO2.
It's everybody who heats themselves, who uses the climate, who takes the plane or the car, who lives in homes that have to be built, who buys industrial products that have to be produced and transported.
It was not climate skeptics who protested against the green tax, but truckers.
No one in politics is climate skeptical and Arnold S consumes far more than I do.
But nobody says climate skeptics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmentalists also move to conferences.
It's that individual actions, even if they matter, won't be enough.
Political action is also needed (other energy sources, reducing dependence on the automobile, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensibilities of their constituents.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise made by McArtur on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator just picked up the phrase.
But it may be humorous to say that the phrase is Terminator.
There are 30 definitions of greenhouse gases, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but any good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it is.
No one knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Bingo from the Guardian: How long before someone blames immigration?
I blame the bitch who took all the money.
Do we count the Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry, and I want my five bucks.
I blame the Democrats for lying.
Or the Democrats' crooks.
Or the Labour liars.
We don't care, they're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump into a car or plane to escape the outbreak only move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Is sex with monkeys better?
You think it's a virus?
I wouldn't recommend you get a prescription for antibiotics.
He contracted Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse got Ebola in Spain.
It's actually thin.
Don't use the word immigration, you'll scare the horses!
The UK depends on immigration to pay all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their toilets, to bury the 30,000 people who die of hypothermia or starvation every year, (don't forget your wool and your cap, which allows you to warm up, turn off the heater AND eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be such a fool.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is this a (bad) joke or was it not done on purpose?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of individuals to spend good time in space making galipets and snoring while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
Reality TV has not invented anything and the authorities are probably waiting for a baby to be conceived up there to ignite the world and capture media coverage from Western royalty accustomed to tabloid maternity wards.
They may have to go back down to earth and find that we are working here!
Contrary to what you might think, we don't send men or women into space to make clowns or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for humanity in general.
And that's in every way.
A lot of things that improve our daily lives come from space exploration.
So yes, it's money that's been spent well.
You can name one thing that improves our daily lives and results from space research.
It's just a hole in the cash.
the ballpoint pen that runs the tip in the air (for writing on the ceiling for example)
To pay for his expenses?
To participate in the manufacture of another useless product?
Or offer investors a way to make more money?
In short, working to work means nothing and represents emptiness itself.
Ah, the latest high-tech toy.
Behind the very small minority of people who go into space, there are several tens of thousands more working to make this possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, especially to take cargo to the station.
If you're thinking about buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think they're buying a plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy one in the future?
They're probably the most dangerous of them all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mislead people into thinking it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, would it hurt the author/editor to put a picture of the sword in question instead of generic pictures of plastic swords?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) on it meant?
Typical bad reporting, we're focusing on the fact that it's just a plastic sword and not the inspiring jihadist text that's written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
Dirani's family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, and the terrorist groups that seek to topple governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people would stop laughing about the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be deadly.
Even the little blankets you give in fast food can pierce the flesh.
Thank you so much for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifies the author's ridicule.
There's no point in trying to make it a  ha, ha, a plastic sword , the facts as you put them out actually support his argument.
I've seen these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never looked threatening, just another version of a cross.
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and he was handing out plastic knives to anyone all night!
I really like the conclusion.
All the wonderful new things, often technological, make many people think that it is a right and a necessity to benefit from them, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a spread cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that weighs in on budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies is frustrating.
For example, the Energy Solidarity Pact allows for the isolation of the fillings of a house for a symbolic €1 when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are actually borne by the energy suppliers!).
Simple and effective but unknown even though over 3000 homes have been isolated this year!
That's interesting about PES.
But I've never heard of it.
Who can appeal and how does it work?
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of consumers from the risks of pollution caused by the use of water-saving toilets and water-saving equipment for the protection of consumers, which is intended to inform 60 million consumers, tests water-saving showers and advocates the installation of water-saving equipment on faucets and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 per year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
This is not a demand crisis, it is a crisis of the system that can no longer produce enough surplus (which would then be redistributed in real terms as income increases) for these surpluses to pay for the increase in expenditure you classify as constrained expenditure.
In other words, energy insecurity is just the reverse of the problem because the economy is no longer growing as fast as it would like.
Note that the (neo-classical) theory of economics is totally unable to answer such a question, because for it there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that is likely to constrain the pace of economic growth, decade after decade, increasingly strongly.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what makes it possible to realize any physical transformation.
Since producing is essentially transforming, energy is what makes it possible to achieve the least economic production (goods or services).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any upward pressure on the supply of energy (not properly called energy production), even in the form of an increase in its price, will in turn force upward pressure on production (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency still requires heavy investment, which is not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and whether or not we can increase the production of cheap energy.
And very official data, such as the International Energy Agency, show that the situation will only worsen in the years and decades ahead (the IEA, in these latest reports, makes it clear that in 2008 production of conventional oil, i.e. cheap oil, peaked).
Oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job no matter what the performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back so that's a level playing field.
Take that France!
You vote no on the 18th.
You 're a webmaster for the Guardian ?
As I've said before: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Yes, you guys did a good job.
Although many Englishmen like to mock the Scots when they only lose, there is no denying that they bring a little color to the tournaments when they qualify, at least until they are eliminated in the first round.
It's even more fun if you play against them.
I'm starting to worry about England.
Because now that the Golden Shige generation is retiring, they might have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the starting XI, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been international-class is David Beckham, a little effeminate, perhaps, but I think if he tackled an overweight potato like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget his athletic constitution, by the way, when they talk about athletic constitution in sports, Wayne Rooney...
I never make fun of Scots.
I tend to find myself watching their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has ever really been international is David Beckham.
Yeah, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best, a very, very good player.
It is certain that Juppe would have difficulty asking for 100,000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he'd get it if he asked...
You mean people come to laugh at a good deal ?
I would be surprised to learn that Debre, for example, lives on his deputies' allowances.
I am especially concerned about what he can tell in his lectures.
How can we reduce the deficit?
How do you get back to full-time work?
I would say that no serious lecturer in a scientific discipline, no matter how scientifically advanced he is, even if he is a Nobel laureate, will consider asking for the minimum amount.
The content conferences are usually free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people are really working and that the results presented in their free lectures are real.
In the context of research budget constraints, the correlation between these figures is constructive.
The lectures of the researchers are even paid by the lab!!!
I mean, I mean...
It's all clear to me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I feel like he's being accused of making money???
I'm not a fan of his, but he's been accused of mismanaging his campaign.
But speaking seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us remember that her travels are covered by taxpayers.
Rule number one of epidemiology: isolate yourself.
All American and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than the political correctness.
It is present in Spain, Great Britain, Texas and other potential locations.
How much population infection will politicians be able to resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the UK, I take the plane to Spain, and then I take a plane back from Spain to the UK.
If Ebola is spreading in West Africa, I see they are prohibiting all flights and ships to the UK.
We'd still need to ship goods, it says...
It is a pity that the international media panic over Ebola is no longer used to talk about the less dramatic but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We are all under threat.
Every corner of the world, men, women, it's such a sad news story, such a big, weak headline.
I could read every paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first caregivers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc, etc.
So much smarter comments could have been made on the ways, the reasons and the places where we can all contribute to better understanding and interpreting cultural and sociological approaches, and the differences in the role of the sexes that could help fight Ebola in West Africa.
Let's get into it, think and write, not just make noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you're not able to offer a good analysis and a smart opinion, maybe you should just think before you write?
Although I would place female genital mutilation on the same level as beheading - an equally barbaric form of terrorism, its survival rate making it a different form of torture - to say that its temporary suspension is a glimmer of hope is beyond comprehension.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give some degree of validity to his opinion, but in this case obviously it does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I thought the Guardian was maturing as a global journalism resource -- moving into the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who on the editorial team makes that sound?
For a territorial elected official or someone else, money doesn't matter.
I read all the time that the territorial public service is increasing its numbers, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
It would be legitimate , indeed .
There will be lies and truths , no doubt , to separate the good grain from the weeds .
The Court of Auditors is expensive to tell so many economic nonsense.
It's true they never had anything to do with the people on Cambon Street.
The CTs are not in deficit; they have funding needs which can only and only concern the investments they make.
By using too vague concepts the press as the world plays the game of all obscurantism.
Debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective wealth
Unfortunately, the debt is mainly financed by operating expenses...
And as over-employment of public servants (for example, to make a nice round-trip) leads to an increasing and uncontrollable burden (a mandatory burden until their deaths, since life-time work + retirement), these communities are cutting back on investment.
The status of civil servant must therefore be abolished before the reduction of allowances.
And also to give the mayors financial responsibility.
It is fantastic, the intercommunities should have been accompanied by a decline in the community population and the opposite is happening, proof that adding one ladder is not effective without suppressing the others.
How do you want to manage large areas like peanuts properly when you're on the TGV and driving?
The time of the horse when these territories were created is over, maybe it's time to act.
They would not rather be imprisoned, worse, engulfed in the administrative web, it seemed!
Let's even try to tie it up, it's not too strong to explain the blockade situation that the state of Vème has led to with its providential men.
It really started with Pétain.
Then he went on to finish the "out of breath" series coming in just in time.
Why don't they go live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco above a movie theater and leave all this suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers like  it's the white man's fault .
 answers  no  answers 
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when you rush to be first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to pass.
Now, we agree that the modern Homo sapiens evolved in northeast Africa about 200,000 years ago, and during a particularly wet period about 150,000 years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had declared a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
He was probably the only one in the government who seemed to be holding the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Resigned !
In 2017: Transformed into a comfortable private hotel of golden closets for future pensioners of the Republic?
Moving upstairs to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the nurses and their families, the "Grand V" care of a three-speed medicine.
We'll save money and the military will treat the last little guy's flu elsewhere...
Did you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all walks of life?
The London Wasps ?
I feel sorry for their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh ?
They left London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to L.A., right?
It's a change that a football team uses the rugby club field instead of the other way around.
Plus, traveling outdoors for the Tigers and Saints will be a lot easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we got unlucky from the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium from them once we regained our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the field, although they had access to other venues, did not please us.
I love being around Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has quite a few fans and until recently was at the top for over 30 years, to see its stadium taken over by a rugby club.
I'm aware of recent problems with the CCFC, but that must be a good slap.
I'm not a club rugby player, and to be honest, I don't know anybody who doesn't, except a few Wasps fans at work.
Are they and a few thousand other people in the Southeast sure to follow them far away or will they now have to endure another team?
Nice pro-domo article and a good promotion.
But who cares ?
But then why aren't ALL computer systems based on these concepts???
+because a gigantic mass of programs already exist (cobol, java), +because not all systems require them, +because there is no magic wand ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what matters is to be first in the segment.
The work of G.
Berry concerns a need for niche.
Mr. Gerard Berry.
We should always (the media) see such characters working for the good of mankind.
For the kids.
I know.
The Professor (retired) Mr. Noel Dejean of the Basement.
The former Director of Law and Political Science at Rennes, Mr François Chauvin.
Professor Hugues Chabriat and his entire team of researchers.
Miss Isabelle Le Bercher and her entire team have L'INSERM.
Mr Jacques Le BER, a brilliant computer scientist.
Maîti Girtanner Concertist (Piano) Professor of Philosophy, Medal of the Resistance, Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor.
Mrs. Hermine Venot is a focused .
But these aren't for sale.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many fields, and few are familiar with the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an olive garden in 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has dropped.
I'm sorry about those who are gonna lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I'd recommend a simpler menu with options that are known for their popularity.
Reducing costs and prices.
There's already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put any salt in the future.
It seems they're arguing with Let's make more profits, not Let's make healthier dishes and the best value for money.
They think we're pigeons.
Oh, yeah, make sure people don't get too greasy.
And then we'll have someone else make our soup, which is better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
We might as well add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you need to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly improves the taste of the finished product.
Not only does salt taste, but it also affects the way pasta is cooked.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to corporate cooking.
Are there family restaurants and do they offer tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What's happening in the United States is very sad.
A common workplace accident that went wrong.
A promising young apprentice thief was following his father's career in prison for murder.
A man has gone all out and abruptly interrupted this vocation.
That he's sentenced to 10 years in prison seems like the minimum.
Where else are we going?
I totally agree.
What a joke!
The desire to solve this is obvious and hardly excusable and blameworthy at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to do so is hardly excusable.
That's why I have a certain sympathy for a 15-year-old.
During the trial the boy's father complained that he would never see his son again but without apologizing to the relatives of the guy he killed himself.
Who's really the victim in this story?
What are you mixing up!!!?
The boy's father was convicted for what he did.
As to the absurdity of the bullets lost, the accused and the guilty knew perfectly well that bullets are dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he's responsible for!
Ten years is a bit much in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot at this young man to make noise?
It was a noise!
If you have the opportunity, go on holiday to the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winegrowers.
I've been doing it twice, the wine, the scenery and the food are great.
Besides, if you're there for one of the many wine festivals that take place in each municipality, it's even better.
Sorry, the Moselle Valley, I was typing too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
It is important to note that German winemakers traditionally use only one grape variety, which means that they must work really hard to maintain some quality.
Of course, some younger generations experiment with different grapes, like in France, Italy, etc.
It is not only the Moselle region that should be recommended - Franconia, the Palatinate of the Rhine (Pfalz), Baden are worth a visit.
One French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German-style (or maybe the opposite, in short).
The Germans prefer beer.
They traditionally drink wine after a meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites at meals, they now offer many, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional bottled wines are so complex, the sweetness is superbly balanced.
Try the Schloss Vollrad Spatlese with a thermidor lobster the next time you go to the restaurant.
Look for Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used to use them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a good guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover wine, but this is a summary of every newspaper article on German wine since the dawn of time.
From time to time, there's an article about German wines that are coming in, the new Baden dry ones that will now accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly strong, but most importantly, it's not the disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (hey, I really don't think it's always true or evocative, unless I'm talking to the over-40s - who, as I say, have already seen all this).
Closing the Val de Grace would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the pitiful state of the French administration.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the side of my great-great-grandfather and great-great-great-great-grandfather who went to college there.
In a democracy, public health management should be subject to the vote of the House of Representatives: these barbecue-style governmental disputes and decisions taken behind closed doors have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin is right.
We should do what we did in Green Sun: euthanasia at 70.
In fact, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor, poor wealthy people, since they can no longer go to the market.
Actually, find jobs for our unemployed, real jobs, and you won't have any more deficit problems!
For the elderly, it's time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The assets, which are in danger of disappearing, will not be able to handle this demographic transition alone...
So, of course, the geriatrics, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (which has been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole postwar model!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medicine in France: a certain rigor and discipline that is more common in public hospitals.
If this symbol falls, we're really fucked.
First we fucked up because the rest of the hospitals are not up to par.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are getting treatment elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more in increasing public service supply in other hospitals than in keeping a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a French centre of medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
Closing it would be a mistake, another sign of France's march towards mediocrity.
Not to mention the military status, which must be kept absolutely.
The "Hospitalization Day Price", a unit of hospital management, is decided by the Ministry under the local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
And I mean, obviously the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to get a better paid job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-citizen parents is almost always a non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries in making children born to Australian residents citizens.
But Australia is being criticized for not meeting some remarkably high standards, with obviously difficult consequences.
Why ???
I think it's a two-by-two.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to end all the persecution and mistreatment and war that is driving people from their countries and forcing them to come to Australia for help.
If he doesn't want people coming by boat, then we have to solve the problem that drives this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, killing tens of thousands on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country is back to normal.
It all makes sense now, Nimrod!
It's strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe this little hoax when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and the mistreatment that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportation of Tamils with LTTE links, believing that they would face torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum assessment guidelines in December 2012 and recommended that people with LTTE ties be considered at risk upon their return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
It's too late, boys!
Señor Nowak, I've been reading this for a while.
In fact, this guy couldn't even get a chance to make it.
He didn't have health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I'd like to know who's going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas maybe, unless some lab pays for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Especially in Texas .
Ah ah !!!!!!!!!!!
Not long ago, we were told that Ebola kills so quickly that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is a whole lot of scientific literature on the subject, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion from the returnees was zero.
The more we're reassured, the more I'm scared.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Weak or very weak, but not bad.
Finally, it's a scientific reality, the faster a virus is deadly (in general) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host signals its own death.
The combination of the two (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes occurs ex the so-called Spanish flu.
After that, the general quarantine to save humanity.
Is it not obscene to promote in the Western media, of course, brave and virtuous people, but at the expense of thousands of other African patients whose profession, bravery or virtues are unknown?
Of course, this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but repeating the announcements is a terrifying bias.
Freedom of speech, so loved by conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers-in-arms attacking freedom of speech and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined their conservative leanings would rob them of their right to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's one who won't next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, fewer health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A warm-up for when the problem really gets out of hand.
There aren't enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this anymore.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the  war  against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Future Market Fund for Medical Research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, would likely be just an emergency budget black box.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will raise $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer those funds as general income.
I hope that the Australian voters can see this great trick for what it is.
Tony Abbott is a lot smarter than we think.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is offset by the Medical Research Futures Market Fund.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the low income people.
That may be very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, the lying rodent and his Telstra Futures Fund were excellent tutors.
If that's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell at the next election.
The worst thing about Nadine is her old personality, delicious...
I noticed it too, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only that could keep her from constantly buzzing about her.
The worst fate for a late-career politician: not being recognized on the street.
She was not recognized in her hometown of Toul as being sufficiently tall to administer it.
What good sense is there in the provincial sense ?
We live in a hateful time, Mrs. Morano.
I'm against wearing the burqa, of course, but that's not the point.
What this anecdote tells us is the sarcasm of the pure state: the small, mediocre people with the rank of ministers, the confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if Sarkozy could, he would come with his tone on every corner of the road to show that he is a good public order keeper), the grossness and the oversight of the people to their maximum extent.
I propose that Morano, Sarkozy and all these former figures who have become unemployed be allowed to carry a gun and a badge so that they can exercise their self-proclaimed function as justices.
But who is Nadine Romano?
That's the main lesson of the case: even the police turned the page on Sarkozy, maybe they don't even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets embarrassing to him.
I envy that agent who didn't know Nadine Morano existed, if only I could do the same...
Like a bob, for a second.
No, it's not funny.
Nadine, if it didn't exist, it would have to be invented!
It's easy, though, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On this one, N.
Morano obviously did in contempt indeed, in contempt of the police officer who was in front of her, and who probably should have multiplied the curves and the curves Yes madam, of course madam, immediately madam, tell me madam in which direction I must run to grab this veiled woman without waiting
 In one case, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air strike on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too high... 
The Americans aren't bad at it, but I still think ISIS is going to outnumber them or they've already done it, in Iraq at least someone was counting the bodies now here nobody is.
As far as civilian deaths on an industrial scale are concerned, nothing compares to the Western war machine.
I disagree, the UN sanctions (including those against non-Westerners) imposed between the two wars in Iraq would have cost the lives of millions of Iraqis, especially children, the elderly and vulnerable adults.
Most anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions to the war machine.
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions to the order and men on the field?
Very good remark - the UN has acted in incredibly harsh and reckless ways in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - perhaps one reason why they have occasional approval from the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents didn't waste time marking their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission Headquarters that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place hard and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
As brutal and brutal as this bombing was, I was surprised by the shock of people to learn that a UN mission was targeted like this.
Good remark, I actually forgot that.
So add half a million people to the total death toll in Western nations (at least with the recent unrest in Ukraine economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It doesn't help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only even vaguely reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under 5 years old and they are even highly suspicious since Saddam Hussain refused to let objective inspectors check the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of the sanctions.
The most reliable estimates put the number of additional deaths for this age group at between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for the additional deaths in the other age groups, estimates are no better than hypotheses.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths among children under five years of age was about 10 times worse than in the UK, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course, we should fear it, but we should also fear the gift of gametes in general.
We have to stop pretending that people are pure-minded, that love is all the children needed, and that we can do it with strangers that neither parent nor child will ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French do genealogy.
It is essential and despised to know its origins.
Instead of pretending to be obvious and using fanciful arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for a child adopted or conceived with a gift of gametes.
If you learned that your foster parents didn't provide the gametes you came from, you might, I think, regret it, because they wouldn't have committed any crime.
The latest developments in WFP (such as uterine transplant) are at least as questionable as a reasonably-adjusted GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: Does the frustration of wanting children justify these acrobatics and this has nothing to do with marriage for all?
Just like the point.
Obviously, you have to be afraid of the GPA, what is this stupid question
Of course, it's sad not being able to have a child when you want to.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
But it is still less serious than being born or becoming very disabled, getting a serious illness, losing all your children in an accident, etc.
Of all the worries of life, it's not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
It's not just living.
And we can always take care of other people's children!
In a society that no longer tolerates any form of frustration, where children become addicted, I find GPA unacceptable.
The desire for a child is not a whim where one could use the other as one pleases.
Sterility requires thought and acceptance.
