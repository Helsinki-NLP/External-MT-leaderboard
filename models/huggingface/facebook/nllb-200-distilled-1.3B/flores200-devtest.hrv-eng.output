This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a popular theory, but it allows for details that fossils don't usually give, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper part of this animal's feathers was brownish brown and the lower part pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed feather feature called a rachis but had other features of feathers  I and II-order spiders , researchers concluded that the feature probably evolved later than that other feature.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or pointing. The researchers claim that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern shows the color of the adult feathers, not the wings of the young.
The study showed that despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern is part of the adult bird's feather color, not the paper of the chicken.
A car bomb exploded outside the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was supposed to simulate observations of Sagittarius' galaxy.
The effect the team was aiming for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way pull the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have proven that dark matter affects each other just like ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy forms a kind of halo around the galaxy that's made up of many small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally not high-tech: voters are isolated in booths, where they put a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the identity of the voter has been verified by the officials, the voter places the envelope in the voting box and signs himself on the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly regulated by the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that they do not have envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added to them except those inserted by correctly numbered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers under strict supervision count the votes following certain procedures.

The Crown Office, which oversees all criminal proceedings, has informed reporters that it will not comment further at least until charges are brought.
The document will, according to information leaked, relate to a border dispute, which the Palestinians want to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years after the treaty is signed, and the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The hunting of the animals in the wild is a major challenge for the local population.
The Commission has received a request from the Australian Government to provide additional information on the fishing opportunities for the Union fishing vessels and the fishing opportunities granted to the Union fishing vessels in the fishing zone of the Australian fishing zone.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Preservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected to perform the first shooting operation received extensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth temporary election in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission announced the former CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to bring about new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections that were due to be held as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, causing six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
"Last week the Department of Trade and Industry said Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company said were "not serious".
"The State Department called Apple's delay in reporting ""really regrettable"."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has declared no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired a shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an optometrist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins spent his spare time researching preterm birth.
His research showed that hormone therapy accelerated the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators found two flight data recorders from the "black box" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'The Moon was the first queen of extreme, my first manager, passed away in the night of the second month, quite unique, just like her, a strong woman.'"
"Dustin "Goldust" Runnells stated, "The moon was as strange as I was, if not stranger... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place".
From 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share the same view, believing that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and triple jump events at the Commonwealth Games, but a complaint has put his health in question.
He couldn't take painkillers because they're banned at the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known until January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was released on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water on Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets form, especially the Earth, which was struck by comets long ago.
Mr. Cuom, 53, began his term earlier this year, and the governor signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
"He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
He's supposed to run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would shorten aircraft flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older radar-based technology, this system uses satellite technology to help air traffic controllers more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport options will be organised and no overhead trains will stop at Wembley, and parking facilities and parking and use of public transport on the ground level will not be available.
Due to fears of lack of transportation, there was a possibility that the game would have to be moved to a closed-circuit without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within just two generations, although the process was believed to take much longer, due to the crossing of the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza fortes, with the newcomer frog, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, rolled into any shape.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be rolled up and spun, hammered or rolled into planes.
"It can be very thin and stick to other metal, and it can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called 'painted manuscripts.'"
It's called chemical pH. Your indicator could be red cabbage juice.
The solution changes color depending on how acidic or basic (fluidic) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ion (H for pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders together, and then press them into the ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle you and cause a lump to form.
In Harappan and Mohenjo-daro, each house was equipped with at least one flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the buildings of mining towns on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and during Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths where both men and women mingled in society.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, use satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists in space use a telescope because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has brought unimaginable changes to the world, but the greatest change was that the invention of the wheel made transportation much easier and faster.
It made possible the invention of the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat a much larger variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche, a special position that a single cat occupies so that it does not have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
Lion packs consist of one to three closely related adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are also very lethal to their prey.
As a complete athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion's voice, but more like a series of incomprehensible, screaming words.
They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, and almost all the animals that they hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and locate prey by smell, by sniffing out where the prey has been moving on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and move very quietly, hunting prey by blending into the environment and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, when crossing a mountain or a river or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
A new environment means different resources and different competition, so a new population needs different characteristics or adaptations from its previous ones in order to compete for resources.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less and less like another population.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe in and then take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants make food from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaur was the main predator of its time so it was not afraid of anything but other mosasaurs.
His long jaw had over 70 sharp teeth along with an extra set of teeth on his nose which means there was no help for anyone who got in his way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a flared tongue, and his diet consisted of turtles, big fish and other mosaura, and maybe he was a cannibal.
It would attack anything that went into the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would not flatten it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicacies that included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and fleas.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate from the tables, while the rich men enjoyed communal banquets where they would eat from the side.
The ancient Roman diet could not contain ingredients that would come to Europe from the Americas or Asia over the following centuries.
For example, they did not know corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by performing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was restricted to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramids formed towers, called ziggurats, that were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops had counters facing the road.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was seldom inhabited, and Norwegian sagas say that Erik the Red, after being banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west and named it after it.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there.
"Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"The back of the Declaration of Independence said, "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776".
No one knows for sure who wrote this large document on parchment (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches), but it is known that it was rolled up for storage soon after it was made.
So, it's likely that the entry was simply added as a marker.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French from Vichy France, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, an attack known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together  society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which refers to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of society in some way.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, a cultural footprint and equal distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and we don't recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states, through the Articles of Confederation, first established a weak central government consisting of only Congress.
Congress had no taxing power, and with no state or judicial authority, it relied on the often uncooperative authorities to enforce all laws.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and customs between states.
The treaty required the unanimous consent of all states, and states did not take the central government seriously and their representatives were usually absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"Since it is made up of a group of islands, Japan is often called an archipelago from a geographical point of view".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing along the island wrote down its name as Ilha Formosa, "Beautiful Island".
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan in 1624, and began to transform Aboriginal grain production practices and employ Chinese workers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal area and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better introduction to how they originally came to be.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common format of photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size before the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, the same ratio is being used in the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
It's a little confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of width and height of this format (divided by twelve to obtain a ratio expressed as prime integers) is therefore 3 : 2.
Many common formats (for example, APS) are equal to or closest to this ratio of width and height.
The rule of thirds, often violated and ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining some order in the image.
He states that the most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European nations with different languages and customs.
The powerful power of Christianity influenced everything from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty, and that church funds exist specifically for that purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they are adhering to that principle.
Soon after the outbreak of the armed conflict, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented Germany from accessing vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in multiple international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, which also posed a danger to neutral ships.
Given that there was little interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most citizens and nations were pacifist and separatist.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (a former employee of his) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way to represent different time periods; each phase of China or each dynasty that was in power was a recognizable dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was a period of unstable division of provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought among the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; thousands died fighting for the top spot in the great palace of Xi'an.
The consequences are social and political, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that land belongs to the people, not the ruler.
Besides, after the Revolution, employment was made available to all men and the most ambitious and successful were given the opportunity to succeed.
The same is true of the army, because after the revolution, ranks were awarded based on ability, not standing.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond the confines of his boring life. "The cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (the light) he visited to be able to think better".
The cave, which has survived through history, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all even if you know for sure it exists.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.
The Pyramid of Khufu, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or the "Necropolis at Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and a host of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members.
"The sign "going upside down" looks like a V and "going downside down" looks like a clutch or a square without a bottom".
The up sign means to start from the top and push the string, and the down sign means to start from the frog (where you hold the string with your hand) and pull the string.
A raised harp usually produces a softer sound, while a lowered harp is more powerful and intrusive.
Feel free to add your own labels, but remember that the labels for the swing are printed for musical reasons, so they should usually be adhered to.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11 year old Marie Therese and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Elizabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats to the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the windows of the carriages open.
At one point, a member of the crowd in front of the horrified queen shook the head of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war costs of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was exchanged through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profit that comes from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will form the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the Order was born.
The era of these events is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The developed Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is governed by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not worth the cost of just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars leads to higher numbers of road accidents, leading to the discovery of new techniques in health care for treating injuries.
In Romanticism there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, geography-related customs and cultures emerge that are consistent with the physical residence of society, and therefore superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400 C.E. to about 1100 C.E.
The status deteriorated in the twelfth century largely because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were of higher value than those offered by the Byzantine market.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The height of the Gothic style was in the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest discoveries of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons on clothing.
Self-sufficient farming is farming to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds for native ecoregions in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, as they still are in many developing lands.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture special may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their belonging through recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the methods most often used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite the cases of children who have grown up without being socialized by adults, either as a result of neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse.
In some cases, abandonment is the result of a parent's denial that their child has severe intellectual or mental disabilities.
Wild children may experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If fully raised by animals, a feral child shows behaviors (within the body limits) that are almost completely similar to the behaviors of the animal that raised it, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
While learning on a project should make learning easier and more interesting, setting up a scale goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not an educational method, but rather a support for individuals facing a new learning experience, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scales can be virtual and real; in other words, the teacher is the shape of the scale, as is the animated connector that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
The virtual scales are internalized into the software and are designed to examine, instruct and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing, and educational, but it is.
We maintain that the foster system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster home should provide for all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The recognisable features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are cited as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"In researching visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" as new motivational aspects".
Using video has made important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, argues that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge its sincerity.
He suggested that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection is removal from a set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation transfer variability between these two sources.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to meet their need for amino acids from available plant sources.
After all, failure has serious consequences: reduced growth, poor nutrition, and eventually death.
The most available plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest uncooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also contain high amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors "solved the protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do in the savannah today".
Interruption is the process of deliberately waking during a normal sleep period and going back to sleep a little later (10  60 minutes).
This is possible by simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without being fully awake.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which makes you get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive life force there is, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everybody can experience enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga activates kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Divine yoga is at the heart of Tibetan meditation, and through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years before the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and lead to truly empowered armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and rearrange along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered Poland and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is certainly the most efficient way for large numbers of people and large quantities of goods to cross the ocean.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods while at the same time preventing the ability of the enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which used submarines mostly, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany probably would have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and skin.
Pitom goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hillsides and other pastures, guarded by goatherds, usually children or adolescents, as shepherds guard goats.
Horse-drawn carriage tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden railway cars consisted of only parallel planks, they allowed the horses to pull the cars at a higher speed and to pull a larger load than would have been possible on the more rugged roads of the day.
Thresholds were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails could be more efficient with iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels to wear out more.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden ones.
The first known mode of transport was walking, and people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus appeared.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedal gait appears in australopithecines from about 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally consciously, we can join environmental movements, and we can even be activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, it's like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't seek a solution that's only temporary, we need to find the root of the problems and neutralize them.
Clearly, the world has been greatly changed by mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems are being exacerbated by people's overworked and extravagant lifestyles.
After Congress passed the handwritten draft on July 4, signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printer.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made of what are now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap copies known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But many features of birds are similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have shells and claws on their legs, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on information handling that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
Perhaps the best indicator of indoor poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look for specific first-aid instructions on the label for this poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in an official sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the well-known bugs, insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Killer and common bed bugs depend on their hosts for their nests and living quarters.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Couples like that can give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by the scientific method, which is actually the guideline for most scientific research.
In addition to this method, experimentation, or experiments that are tests to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and observing, also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed ties with its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not just a response to external cyclical stimuli, have been discovered in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Your body clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue its period of free cycles even when there are no external cues.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They ran two experiments that pointed to DNA in a radioactive phosphorus phase or a radioactive sulfur phase protein.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the germline cells are affected.
Only mutations in the sex cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and drive to work as they pass those whose work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport scenario, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a private car-based transport system.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed lands, complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rare.
Why are transportation systems the subject of so many complaints; why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something much bigger at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a reasonable degree of consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, links between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from enemies and more efficient in finding food and steam.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along their body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't bend their wings are the fairy horse and the water lily.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were convinced otherwise - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the earth.
That makes sense because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide in places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 miles long, fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids were built until the fall of the Old Kingdom, none of them surpassed the size and technical prowess of the Giza pyramids.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of the country's workers, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People of ancient times knew about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made up of one or a mixture of more than four elements, which are earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new matter to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
The use of the term 'alloy' is not excluded.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil thus became a close friend to a large number of people when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has lost its status and is becoming less common.
People today type messages on computer screens, so they don't even need a pin.
We can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The physics bomb works by taking energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing heavy carts up a hill, and splitting the core releases some of that energy back.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay under mild push or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner in the lunar seas and thicker in the plains.
On the near side, there could be more dark areas because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature and grow.
These theories examine what makes people want what they want and what environmental factors cause them to do or not do something.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when leaders start managing former colleagues.
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, assigning authority, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done so far and do it his way.
The leader of a team is ultimately responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a gap between the leader and others.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often represent the touchpoint to the nearest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which the local administration may not understand.
"The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The invisible team is the leadership team that each member is responsible for.
Why would an organization go through the lengthy process of re-establishing a learning organization?
After all available resources are efficiently spent in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come into play.
The process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet a customer's need.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method by which organisations can achieve a higher degree of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, making the field of study narrower and more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by scientific research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of information science that deals with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research into artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, construction and the military because it is embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a virtual field trip solution where students can tour museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in class.
Virtual sharing of the trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the page changes, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of memorial.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. When students start blogging, they often make grammar and spelling mistakes, but the presence of an audience often corrects them.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them.
A blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to take learning beyond traditional school.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""can encourage students to analytical and critical thinking; by actively responding to material from the Internet, students can define their own viewpoint in the context of others' writings and express their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming capital city and offers a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Slightly further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
All of these things make Ontario feel essentially Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas farther north are sparsely populated, some almost ruled by uninhabited wilderness.
To make a comparison of population that may surprise many, there are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent in terms of flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have links with France and are popular luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which took root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is surrounded by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that women on a trip say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that could be considered harassment and it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Firmly reject men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (that is not okay regardless of cultural differences!).
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and in Phoenician, Roman, and Merenid times, the city was known as the strategic port of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as baked goods, pots, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole host of other trinkets, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by a lion from Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be explored to understand the nature of the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for hiking the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking options in Africa.
A boda-bod (motor taxi) can be used to tour Goma, and the normal (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Because of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu is now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands".
Although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport, Timbuktu is now a poor city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the main places Henry Louis Gates stopped during the filming of the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more of an Arab world than an African world.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park's 12,000 square miles [19,500 sq km] are divided into 14 different ecozones, each with a different species of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the premier South African National Park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and admission.
Some may also find it helpful to buy a joker ticket that allows entry to certain parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is a major center for many tourists.
The display of buildings that make up the panorama of Hong Kong is comparable to a glittering column chart, made even more visible by the sea at Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on land along the northern coast.
This place was taken over by the British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that is located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last sites of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges valley.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and are now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts, small, comfortable, sturdy Japanese Toyota Coasters are used.
Taxi sharing is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 No.) and Punakha (200 No.).
The suspension bridge spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The Commission has concluded that the measures in question are in accordance with the principle of proportionality and are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Transport,
The Guarani were the most important indigenous community in what is now eastern Paraguay, a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer and self-sufficient farmer.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering fruit, and fishing.
After the Spanish conquistadors encountered the indigenous population in the 16th century, Paraguay was born, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies".
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Paraguay has largely managed to retain its indigenous character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
The Argentine national team and the midfielders are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo courts in Las Cañitas
Smaller tournaments and matches are held in other parts of the year.
For news on tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches check the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted in remote islands, but they may accept British and American currency; check with the owner in advance to find out what payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer while it has winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; temperatures of +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of being colder than the thermometer shows.
"There are no particularly 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall is generally the same throughout the year".
Although many animals in the park are used to human visitors, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park guidelines, maintain a minimum distance of 100 yards to bears and wolves and 25 yards to other wildlife!
No matter how obedient they may seem, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they didn't keep the proper distance.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the Mau-led struggle for independence, the Tupue supreme leader Tamasesea Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the town.
With two harbors, Auckland has many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Nearly all the beaches are sandy, safe for swimming, and many are cool with Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches is located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods of central Auckland.
It's a family beach that can get crowded with a wide variety of shops along the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One' the beer is not complex but is pleasant and refreshing the second local beer is called 'Manta'
There are plenty of French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more to your liking.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're afraid, you'll easily find bottled water.
"The concept of 'plain white' coffee is foreign to Australians. Short black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of topping (not foam), and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate is Belgian, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Still, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and follow safety warnings.
Sea otters appear near beaches and estuaries north of the city from October to April 1770, sometimes in other months.
Sharks exist, but they often attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles are not active in the ocean; their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance relieves the traveler of his burden, knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although other forms of accommodation such as camping may be available through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, organised transport to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents needed to arrive at your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants camp on the festival site and most consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you'll have to arrive early to take your seat.
Please note that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are traveling in the northern Baltic in winter, be careful about your cabin choice because the ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city.
Casinos usually try to maximize the amount of time and money that guests spend, usually with no windows or clocks, and hard to find exits.
They usually offer special food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and in the facility.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers recognize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy roads and snow-covered roads, there's little friction and you can't drive like you're on clean asphalt.
During a thunderstorm, soon enough, enough snow can fall to get you stuck in it.
The visibility may also be limited by snow falling or carried by wind, condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, but traffic is generally uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the best experience for many visitors.
In everyday usage, the term safari refers to a journey by land to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannas.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with a telescope.
"Walking safaris (also called "bushwalking", "mountain safari" or "walking safaris") consist of walks lasting from a few hours to several days".
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, the 1964 host city, will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you could be in a bit of a pickle.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation rules have not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were due to be held.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels will rent a washer and dryer even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a hair iron, or if you don't like wearing polished socks, you can also use a hair dryer if you have one on hand.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can lead to clumping or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to treat water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, a minute of boiling water is enough, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you have any doubts, buy bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not used to in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, transmit poison, or cause infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not usually classified as plagues.
Purchases in duty-free shops provide an opportunity to purchase products exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can save a considerable amount of money, especially when buying alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount has the most demanding driving conditions on the Buffalo  Pittsburg Highway, often passing through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware of the steep inclines, narrow passages, and sharp turns.
The speed limits prescribed are visibly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mi/h (56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to the limits is more important than usual.
Interestingly, though, mobile service here is better than many other stretches of road, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery products are quite good and varied in Bavaria, as in the southern neighbours of the Austrians.
Fruit dough desserts are common, such as apples added to year-round desserts and cherries and plums used in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, nuts, and other nuts.
If you want small but lavish snacks, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a herb- and spice-based dish with meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be either "dry" or "wet".
Yogurt is a common curry ingredient in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; coconut milk is the most commonly used in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is the umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines across the country.
But when used without further specification, the term refers to food that is native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine consists of a variety of simple spicy dishes, with Javanese favorites of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
They are steep supports for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they also involve certain safety risks because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse but his leg is caught in the stirrup, the horse may pull him away if he runs away.
First, most drivers wear high-heeled boots with smooth, narrow heels.
Some saddles, especially the English saddle, have safety crossbars that allow the strap to detach from the saddle if the rider pulls it back in a fall.
The Cochamó Valley is a major climbing destination in Chile, also known as South America's Yosemite because of its variety of large granite cliffs and gravels.
From the summits, breathtaking views are offered, and climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes amid the endless possibilities it offers.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow slope using a ski or snowboard attached to the legs.
"Skiing is an important travel activity, and many people known as "ski lovers" plan their annual vacations around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC.
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational ski club.
Backpacking and skiing: also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering although it does not usually include them.
Think of a ski trail as a mountain-like trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover a little more distance than walking, but you will rarely reach the speed of skiing without a heavy backpack on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries, and traveling through several countries would normally mean applying for a visa and going through passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this respect.
As long as you're in that zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen country individually, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiques, but some tax authorities define antiques as goods over 100 years old.
There are geographic differences in definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade items may be called antiques even though they were created later than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami people, and the culture associated with trade is important to many people in other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding. They lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, and reindeer were mainly used for towing.
Today, many Sami people are involved in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami area of Sápmi.
"Although the word 'Gypsy' is widely used, especially among non-Romani peoples, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma".
If the country you are travelling to is on the list of countries for which a warning has been issued, this may affect your travel medical insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can consult with governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
A brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often short, general and oversimplified in comparison with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
The Commission has also identified a number of other factors that could affect the impact of the measures.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world in a variety of forms, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, thunderstorms, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are also forms of the effects of dangerous weather conditions, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal inclement weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of the potential risk of inclement weather in their area as this may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
"If you do an Internet search with the keywords ""course to enemy territory"", you'll find the address of a local company".
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here in more detail, usually with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid lessons, and sometimes weapons training.
Many books and magazines deal with survival in the wild, but publications that cover war zones are rare.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documents for return.
The willingness to issue passports that do not contain an X or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies from government to government.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect such documents also varies from government to government.
Checkpoint searches also became more drastic in the post-9/11 era.

A tidal current is a return of waves that break against a shore, often against a reef or similar.
Because of the underground topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper parts and it is possible to create fast current towards greater depths.
Death usually occurs when a person becomes exhausted trying to swim against the current, which is often impossible.
Once you're out of the electricity, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to swim without being caught by the current again, or, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted, you can wait for help.

"Finland is a great destination for sailing. ""The land of a thousand lakes"" has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagoes".
You don't necessarily need a yacht to get to the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for yachts, sailing in smaller boats or kayaks offers a completely different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, which has one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in 40).
Most famous Baltic cruises involve an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.

As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.

Understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help some to overcome fear based on uncertainty or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for quick delivery, and timing is often crucial when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies have had problems.
If the cargo were to be sent by air, unloading and customs procedures on some routes would take days.
The only way to get through this faster is to send things as checked baggage, because airline rules say baggage can't travel without passengers, and that's where you come in.
Of course, you can fly first or business class if you set aside a large bundle of bills (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: Generally speaking, expect to pay up to four times the usual price of economy class seats, or 11 times the first-class price!
In general, it makes no sense to ask for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that a certain group of passengers are willing to pay a large sum of money for the privilege of a quick and comfortable flight, and they set prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the language of the population is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
