The city of Juankoske will join the city of Kuopion at the beginning of 2017.
The city council unanimously approved the union on Monday.
The Juankoske City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuzniem was also involved in the settlement of the municipality, but its board decided that Tuzniem should remain independent.
The following municipal elections shall be decided separately by Kopi and Juankoski.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the merger of the Juankoske, the population of Kuopi is about 111,000.

Modi's five-day visit to Japan is intended to strengthen economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
The main topics of discussion are the plans for expanding nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused Kiev's leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current leadership of Kiev does not want to conduct a substantial political dialogue with the eastern part of the country, Putin said, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said that Russian-leaning separatists, who Kiev and the West claim to be aided by the Russian military, were trying to push Ukrainian troops further from their current positions where Putin said Ukrainian army troops were shooting at civilians.
The aim of the militiamen is to push these armed forces and their artillery away so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmikorya.
I was surprised to find the group was already here at the beginning of the night.
Visitors were expected within two days, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Hip Hop Festival of the Valley was held for the third time.
I'll do it again next year.
We're still going to be hip-hop festivals, so pop is not allowed, Kangas assures us.
A law restricting the procurement of explosives is due to come into force in Finland on Tuesday.
In the future, individuals will have to ask the police authorities for permission to buy or keep substances or mixtures that could be used as the so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the specified levels are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in cleaning and washing products, but its levels are generally not above the limit.
Nitromethane is used, for example, during the acceleration period.
However, raw materials obtained before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with the Nairn and Pitlochry hotel robberies.
The accused of two rapes at the hotel is awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing in the High Court of Justice in Glasgow.
He is accused of rape which took place at Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of assaulting a woman in her sleep, unconscious, and thus unable to make a decision for herself.
Webster is also charged with second-degree rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairnis, Upper Canada, on May 4, 2014.
The trial, in accordance with the decision of Justice Lady Rae, will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh at the High Court.
Super Raheem was great Mario was in the shadows
Only 19 year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered the future hope of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere when Mario Balotelli's Liverpool, reinforced by the newly formed Liverpool, arrived at Tottenham as a guest.
Super Marion's debut was promising: experienced English reporters saw the 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City's time.
Balotelli was still a long way from its peak.
The Italian lost three quality goals and only gave half of his 16 points to his own team.
The pool bearers who already favored the player are expecting better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been appointed as the second striker for Balotelli's Barcelona tour, alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The team star, instead of Balotelli, was center-field diamond pinhead Raheem Sterling, who knocked out Hugo Lloris in the 3-0 victory.
Sterling, 19, is not only outstanding in his work.
A Britishman who's six inches shorter than Balotelli is between the lines of his opponent than a fish in the water.
The attribute is not common for a player who at best thanks the grass for a speed of about 34 kilometers per hour.
Rodgers deserves a lot of credit for Sterling's progress, too.
The North-East Irishman told the BBC after the match how Liverpool had systematically developed a North West London-born coach from a Wembley-born player into a more complete player.
Susanna Mlkki was chosen as the new headmaster of the Helsinki City Orchestra.
The Helsinki City Council has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next Principal Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times has been asking what band he's going to be next.
Susannah Moll says she's starting her new assignment with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has been a central part of our country's musical life for over a century, including the large number of performances of Sibelius.
The orchestra has been led by the finest Finnish conductors and I have worked with many orchestra members before.
I look forward to our future cooperation", he says.
The governments of the employers' organisations are consolidating their pension negotiations - Country - Regions - News - Kariala
The pension negotiations are being given a new impetus today by the own meetings of the social partners.
The management of the SAK, Akava and STTK of the employers' organisations will discuss the negotiated situation in the morning.
After that, the actual retirement negotiations are to continue.
The labour market organisations have been raising concerns about the age of retirement and life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a job-sharing solution by the fall, but the latest estimate is that it will be available this week.
It's a little bit of a shock.
The women's volleyball team from Rovaniemi, Romania, has lost the league to the Vampura Athletes in the final of the Pihtiputa training tournament on Sunday.
The vampire turned five in a three-way tie for third place.
Last round, WoV lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defense and the pass game, Vampula was a little better, WoV's coach, Teemu Makikiro, saw.
WoV's six-inch was so huge that the 6-foot-tall American lady Jennifer Keddy was stuck in her back.
Sara Niemi was the center.
Despite her thumbs, Karolina Kyllönen was a player and formed the most powerful combination of WoV with Johanna Pekkari.
Jenna Middle, who started as a hitter, was given the opportunity to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the final 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampire was the skilled Russian passenger and the free Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who was circulated as much as possible by WoVo.
WoV's preparations for the league will continue next week when Hämeenlinnan HPK arrives at training camp in Rovaniem.
The team will meet Saturday at the "Trade" at 6 p.m. for the official practice game.
Sunday's the day they're scheduled to rehearse at the gym.
Lidl is a big hit in Finland .
The company's sales of Finnish retailers increased by almost 25% to almost EUR 1.2 billion in the financial year ended at the end of February.
The company released its results on Monday.
Lidli now has a total of 142 stores in Finland and plans to continue its expansion.
Lidl also said that it paid almost EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland in the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4 200 employees in Finland.
More ovarian cancer deaths in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video to honor their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers examined the patient data of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
NEW medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers reviewed the seven-year history of women's health.
Dr. Susan Jordan also said that the woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, past illnesses, and socioeconomic status also affected her chances of survival.
The risk of survival was lower in older women and when the cancer was more widespread.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible causes.
Gynecological oncologists are the best at treating this disease, and their reception centers are mostly in large cities, Jordan says.
In addition, while remote care is becoming more widespread and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher suggests increasing mobility for doctors to allow specialist doctors to treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients treated remotely.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographic location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is being published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old Gold Coast family mother named Elisha Neavel was diagnosed with a malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the park's activities in the Friendship Park, located next to the Pohjanhov Hotel.
The City Council decided on Monday to make the proposed station building for the Friendship Park and its surroundings publicly accessible at the service point in Osvitta.
The draft proposal is being considered by the Environment Committee and the LIFE Centre in Lapland.
The city wants to allow the continuation of tourism-related motor-vehicle activities in the area through the transformation of the station.
The site is to be a parkland, including the area between the present Friendship Park and the river.
The proposal suggests that the site be permanently closed to motor vehicles for a maximum of 200 days between 15 November and 30 April.
The area may also be equipped with refuelling points for a given part.
The new park area will also be serviced.
The city of Rovaniemi has leased the area of the Friendship Park to safari companies for winter motor racing.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and will be valid until spring 2018.
The cork-parking activity and the changing of scenery have also attracted strong opposition.
Residents of neighboring apartment buildings have been both concerned about noise and emissions.
However, the emissions from the area have been investigated and no findings beyond the guideline have been reported.
The restored furniture is a little more low-emission than the old one.
The idea of a friendship park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point were moved further away, the hotel's safari customers would be transported to the departure points of the safari by buses, which would be an estimated 15 departures per day.
The area and surroundings of the Friendship Park are also large enough for the inhabitants, according to the city, and are better than the places proposed as alternate starting points, such as the boat factory on the east side of the Ounas River bridges.
The Friendship Park is also a good location, and in future activities may be extended to the Ounaspaviljong area.
The consolidation of the park is part of the urban strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, which aims to create a good business environment by providing adequate quality areas for logistically and operationally affordable places.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for motor traffic in the city's parcel of land, which has not yet been approved.
The decline in housing is evident in the garden shops
The decline in homeownership, particularly among those under 35, could lead to a decline in turnover of garden shops by tens of millions as today's young consumers reach the age-specific target for garden sales. Financial Times reported on a study by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) in the United Kingdom.
According to the Financial Times, homeowners spend only 55 percent of the money homeowners spend on gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in highly urbanized homes without gardens, and that the size of the garden is shrinking as the front yard is increasingly covered with parking space, and that these factors also threaten the garden sector, which is estimated to be worth around £5 billion a year.
In the Greater London area, housing ownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, and it is the country's lowest per-household expenditure on garden products.
However, according to the HTA and the British Horticultural Society (RHS), increasing the rental of housing or reducing the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's chief gardening adviser, says that for example, plants grown in portable farming containers are particularly popular with residential tenants because such farming containers can be adapted if necessary.
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a booming period for reselling in the garden sector, as ownership and wealth of dwellings increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will increase this year due to improved weather conditions, which worsened in March and April last year.
Turkey is questioning U.S. diplomats over a spy report .
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on the US and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulentin said the US Embassy's affairs manager and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online newspaper The Intercept have written that leaked documents by former National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was a major spy base for US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the report, saying that all the major states have spied on each other.
A previous report on the German intelligence agency's spying on Ankara has sparked a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze is in a new Finnish film
Marie-Josée Croze, a Canadian actress who has appeared in several successful films, has been cast in the female lead role in a new Finnish film.
Croze will star in director Mikko Kuparisen's film 2 Nights at the Morning, which is set to begin filming this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her role in the 2003 film Invasion of the Barbarians.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's Munich and Julian Schnabel's Butterfly Glass.
The man in the movie Two Nights in the Morning is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
The police chief of Magaluf , Mallorca , accused of corruption
The reporting agents presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvián City officials at the Mallorca Attorney General's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvian, a resort town on the Mallorca island, has been arrested following corruption allegations by businessmen and bar owners in the Magalfu region known for a humid celebration.
Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was placed on probation after several Punta Ballena street business owners filed corruption charges against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the people who reported the case presented evidence of a blackmail by police and Calvián city officials at the Mallorca anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and are being questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
Nationwide ABC newspaper reported on the angry bias of the authorities of the nightclub owners, which greatly undermined their business.
There is no longer money in the matter, but survival, one business owner told the court.
You're not gonna ruin our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was on the headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video went viral online showing an 18-year-old British vacationer having oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawling.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrollable behavior of Magalufi holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcoholic pub crawlers.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub where the oral sex video was filmed was closed for a year and the owner and pub crawler Carnagé were jointly fined €55,000.
The popularity of the Magalfu resort, especially among young British tourists, has been the balcony trend, which has caused several alcohol-related accidents when people jump from balcony to balcony to hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after a summer of bombing raids, when rockets and grenade launchers bombed their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and schools were closed as the region recovered from fighting.
The opening of schools caused excitement and excitement in the missile bombardment of southern Israeli communities, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, workers at the Pashosh daycare center removed fragments from the walls and sliding objects before the children arrived when the rocket hit the daycare center.
"We're a little scared but also excited", says Ronit Bart, who lives in a Kibbutz community in Israel called Saad and works as an English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area are in dire need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks going back to school after a long time feels weird.
"We've had some difficult times when we haven't left home", she says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the start of the ceasefire last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saadi had remained indoors or fled to safer areas beyond Gaza to escape the firing of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Strip are skeptical of returning after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, the fair ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border that was the target of a heavy Palestinian occupation.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that their education and safety would be taken care of.
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire agreement last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not solve many key issues, such as Hamas' demand to remove the islands of Israel and Egypt and reopen the air and sea lines of Gaza.
Israel wants to strip Hamas of its weapons and return the body of an Israeli soldier killed in two wars.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has been at odds with the death toll, saying at least half of those killed were soldiers, although it has not had any solid evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
In the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza troops fired 4,591 rockets and grenades at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, for its part, carried out more than 5,000 expressions and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter in over 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelter and fighting continuing, school officials moved the start of school last week.
"I hope that the school opens soon and we can go back to school, just like other children in the world and like Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old refugee at a school in Gaza City.
The most commonly used measure is the highest increase in housing prices in the Australian winter months in seven years.
RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, a home price benchmark in the Australian capital, rose 1.1% in August, RP data showed on Monday.
The increase in prices during the summer, July and August period resulted in a total increase of 4,2% or more than in the same months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10,9%, more than double that of the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
Tim Lawless, RP Data's research director, said Sydney and Melbourne were at the top of the price hike.
RP Data's results show that housing prices increased by 16,1% in Sydney and 11,7% in Melbourne the previous year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the most active, with average price increases of 5 to 6%.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose only 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that started in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
Given the rise in auction house sales, the generally high sales rate and the continuing low interest rate, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months, says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted recording audiences to its grounds.
A new museum and art gallery has attracted record-breaking audiences to the Band this summer.
By the end of August, over 70,000 visitors had visited the Serlachius Museum of Art.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has featured, among other things, classic works of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
On Monday, the local photography company said it had recorded a record attendance of 14,500 at the Moment event this summer.
I'm not used to these readings.
People have closed doors and windows", says director of the Serlachius Museum Pauli Sivonen.
The website estimates that this year's number of visitors to the Serlachius museums will approach 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppulas, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
The director of the museum, Sivonen, reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent", he says.
I hope the artistic period continues well into the summer.
In the fall, the museum opens new exhibitions.
Police are investigating four robberies in the last four days in Kajan.
Sunday night, a business building on North Side was broken into by a window.
The perpetrator had a small sum of money with him from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, a truck tank was stolen from the fuel tank on the Deep Line.
Between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its trail engines were taken from the port of Betanisi.
The warship was a Pisces-marked, purple outer hull and yellow inside.
The inside of the window was written "OIVA" on the cleft side.
A couple of suspects from theft, the police already got a lock on them.
On Sunday night, a business property was broken into at the Tikkapuranti.
A police officer was tracked down and a 20-year-old male from the police department was found hiding under a bush in the woods.
On Monday, police arrested another man in Paltamo, suspected of the same crime.
The missing amphetamine was the cause of the murder in Kajan
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamine resulted in the murder of a fisherman born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man went into the apartment with his open-door partner and another man and shot the suspected drug dealer, a 34-year-old Cyanese woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man he was carrying was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police guard stopped a passenger car with a group burning blood work clothes.
In addition to the burned clothes, a rifle was found in the car.
The Court of Appeal will rule on the case later.
August was a rare summer in many places.
According to the Meteorological Institute, August is the warmest month in the world, averaging once every ten years.
Statistics from the Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
In most of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
The July and August temperatures have made the summer warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the summer was measured in the first week of August in Poros, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never controlled me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a Jamaican immigrant family of seven children in Dudley, British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently training for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is based in part on a fictional conversation he had with his father and which is based on a Radio 4 series.
The sound barrier is a mixture of reggae and rap in the upbeat sense.
Henry's been going through some painful childhood memories.
She's been in therapy a lot since her mother died, and she's been thinking a lot about her relationship with her father.
Dad was very hard to read.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, "Stop the noise".
Leave your sister alone.
- Get out of here!
I'm watching cricket now.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to a pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of beer training or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about that kind of thing.
For most of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal factory in Dudley, and thus gained insight into what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than they were then.
Today, the sinks are a little brighter, but they are practically dark, smoke-filled, maze-like depths, with flames, smoke, and smoke that evoke the spirit of hell.
My father used to go to the bathroom and just lie down in the shower, and slowly he started singing himself while washing the dirt from the sink.
As I walked around the pool, I realized that she had been working for years to get us food at our table, and I began to appreciate her more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood was lacking in the closeness of his parents.
My father never asked me, and he never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother got sick a little before she died that we started telling each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter Billie with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he lacked in himself as a child.
Do you have to keep fighting, "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
I'm with Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She 's a great mother .
Henry is still a good friend to the Frenchman, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons my mother died.
When I began to suffer from severe obesity and diabetes, my doctor told me to make a complete change.
After that, I started doing a lot of exercise, and I also had to start a strict diet to reduce symptoms.
It 's very difficult .
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's famous, short beard may be a picture of his change in career.
After receiving a lot of positive reviews from critics for her role as Othello, she has immersed herself in theatre.
The next turn was the Comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences (Aidat).
Making theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has made throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the business when he was only 16 years old, working in a factory.
A midwife spotted him doing a set of impersonations and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's television career began in the mid-1970s. "For a long time, I was the only black TV impersonator and comedian", he says.
Henry learned it while he was working.
I had to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn to make jokes from the slide show in 1975-85, while I was a star and I was on TV.
Lenny New Faces in the talent show in 1975
Henry's manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light-hearted entertainment show where characters were dressed in black, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never been part of it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and offensive, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to treat audiences.
Yet the award-winning, multi-year favourite and light entertainment programme on British television was a "lovely parody of black people".
Henry worked in the '80s on another comedy series that both mocked and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was best known for his role as Chef Gareth Blacklock on the sitcom Chef!
Henry spent the next decade in commercials, documentaries, TV shows and movies, but after his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len?
The next round was the Radio 4 documentary series Whats So Great About...?.
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us in school properly, and I think it was a white middle class that wears socks and has money.
That's why the Shakespearean theme made me so afraid.
All the people we interviewed on the show -- Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench -- they said to me, "Try it.
Don't give up the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You date words and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt almost like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put back.
That's what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your language, do a little background research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was actually done.
The play was a success in the end.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't.
Soon after, Henry played the lead role in the comedy The Wrongdoers.
Suddenly, I was playing at the National Theatre of Great Britain, and I couldn't believe it was real.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed".
Once, there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
A little voice in my mind told me, "You're gonna have to do this for 10 minutes alone until the computer goes back to work".
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me was sighing for relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
You're part of the show, stay in your role.
Henry Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the words of the mountain to the Fences show was challenging.
Panic is a good thing. It makes you more resilient.
This play was well received, too, so it was like a sign from the gods; this is what you have to do.
Henry, of course, says this in a CUMBLE voice.
So I decided to stick with this.
I really love this job.
I love the practice rooms.
But Henry is still basically a comedian: little humor boys constantly interrupt our conversation as he switches from one imitation to another.
To refrain from standing-up comedy is a matter of will, for receiving immediate praise from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to impasse.
I spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theater when I feel like it, but generally speaking, it doesn't inspire me the way it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting .
It's really fun.
The show keeps telling stories, and I love it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya prepares a register of officials to remove the 'haunted' workers
Kenya has begun to produce a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove the 'happy' workers from the government's payroll.
Workers who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will continue to be paid salaries after they leave office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to curb public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
Earlier this year, an audit showed that wages and other financial abuses were at least $1 million per month.
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left office, BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reported from the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials must register themselves in the identification centres within the next few weeks to ensure that their information is stored in biometric registration form, the government said in a statement.
The information shows that anyone who fails to do so without a proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
This measure will significantly streamline the public sector, as it will determine how many people actually work in their jobs, and will also clear the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of 'workers' in the labour market', says Anne Waiguru, a Cabinet official in charge of decentralisation and planning.
The Commission therefore concludes that the aid granted to the City of Wallonia is compatible with the internal market.
The current budgetary draft estimates the annual budget deficit at around 9.4 million.
The potential means of efficiency were to improve the scale and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale and granting of assets and the increase of tax and payment revenues.
The total investment target of EUR 10 million is EUR 8.5 million.
The situation in the municipalities is not going to be relieved.
The new obligations imposed, insufficient growth in tax revenues, rising unemployment and a 5% cut in government contributions further weaken the outlook.
The aim of the Economic Seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city council is unanimous in its view that the savings must be made.
The ship must be converted to a strategic objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, the chairman of the city council.
The city government returned the presentations to the management team for preparation.
The proposals of the City Council will be the basis for the budgetary preparation at the City Council Economic Seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the town hall seminar, the budget proposal will be forwarded to the town hall and the city council through a panel discussion.
Ten Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of 'revolving against the government'
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of plotting against the government, local media reported.
Police did not immediately comment.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some of the police were involved in corruption investigations last December, which targeted government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large criminal gang and monitoring phone calls.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) said the police actions were part of the planned actions against him and other leaders of the Islamist leader Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children go back to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiting reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace in all Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire vast Ukrainian army, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is the head teacher at the Slaviansky school where Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that the children can learn something that will benefit them in the future.
Traditionally, the first day of school includes the handing over of children's written shirts, balloons and flowers to teachers.
Perry from Texas said the slanderous tweet was not a good one.
A slanderous image of a Democratic district attorney was posted on Twitter on Sunday night from the confirmed Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry amid allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by another tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent from my account.
I do not accept the tweet and have deleted it, the subsequent publication said.
Perry's back-up forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it's unclear who posted the image.
The first tweet included a slanderous smear campaign by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month as Perry was being charged.
The headline of the tweet was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times the permissible number of bars... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing fingers".
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg Bureau did not lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio Special Prosecutor appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political conspiracy.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge handling the case to drop the charges, saying the law that charges the longest-serving governor of Texas is obscure as a reflection of the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state funding to the state's public integrity agency, which operates in Travis County and handles public-sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-leaning monitoring group to file a formal complaint.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated  and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth in Iowa's 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the race by posting a picture of himself running around the lake on Twitter with the text "From here to South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is back to normal.
One of London's leading builders has warned that the housing market in South East England has returned to normal activity.
The capital city of London has seen huge demand for housing and a sharp rise in prices, while fearing widespread credit scarcity, which led the Bank of England to impose housing limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-end builder Berkeley, said on Monday that since the start of the financial year, markets and trade have returned to normal following the 2013 peak, adding that this has allowed for a stable operating environment.
The London housing market went well during the recession, when foreign investors flocked to the capital.
According to the register, the prices of housing in the city increased by 18,5% in the previous year alone, thus clearly exceeding the average of 6,7% in England and Wales.
The average selling price of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by around the fifth quarter of the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, a stronger trend has made London less attractive to real estate in recent months - partly because of new property taxes and political rhetoric about the potential for a 'card tax' ahead of the May general election.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported tighter loan terms, would lead to lower market growth in both sales and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England's recent data showed on Monday that the number of loans approved declined in July, which is a sign of a cooling housing market.
Property broker Hamptons International has cut its 2015 forecast of London property prices by 3%, as the index of homeowners' opinion on prices has already begun to weaken.
The number of deals made in London's most expensive areas of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen by a quarter a year ago, real estate broker WA Ellis reports.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a boon to Berkeley, which has increased revenues from the sale of properties by more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that demand for the best-designed, right-of-the-kind product in the best locations has remained stable and therefore sales have remained steady.
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40% year on year, thus amounting to £380 million and turnover increased by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Mr Pidgley said on Monday, ahead of the company's annual meeting, that the results of the year at Berkeley were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before tax for the full year is £450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold at a flat rate on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon for £23.96.
A hacker leaked nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence to the Internet .
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to have photos of 100 other stars leaked nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games confirmed the photos were authentic and condemned the hacker for "proudly violating privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The images, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo publishing site, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to a weakness in Apple's iCloud storage system.
It's not clear how many of the images are authentic, but Scott Pilgrim vs. the World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"To those of you who are watching photos taken years ago in private at my home with my husband: I hope you have a good mood", Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickelodeon's "Carly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that the so-called nude images of me are FALSE, don't you understand?
Let me end this right away .
BuzzFeed reported late on Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
We're the only ones who have a copy of Howard Jacobson's acclaimed novel about love and the letter J.
They slipped, it captured the best of what happened, and gradually they split apart like a box of pan out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from the woman that he was too serious, overly hardworking, intense, disconnected, and perhaps even a little bit spicy.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yeah, he was a spider like a silk.
His last victim of his sting was an early relationship, but one that had been promising; it seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might even have brought some content to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had unadorned hair and was a tender tender, tender beauty with a cheerful heart, from a northern village that was even harsher and farther from anything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion whom Kevern assumed was his aunt, who had inherited a house in a humid but paradise-filled valley, aptly called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, the ants had left their mark on the windows, taking over the whole place, and the garden grew rich grasses that resembled giant pot heads.
The cottage was like a bunch of children, threatening and magical at the same time, a garden full of secrets.
Narrated by Howard Jacobson, whose novel J is shortlisted for the 2014 Booker Prize for Fiction.
The proposals will be published next week .
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailynn in broken steel chairs in the middle of a long grass, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening to the reception through which the whole country heard soothing music and calming news, as Ailynn's crossed, sun-browned feet brought to Kevern's mind a song sung by a long-forgotten black performer and often heard by his father on the flame of a cottage beneath the ground.
Your leg is too big.
These songs were, in principle, too aggressive and were no longer played at the reception.
They weren't banned  nothing was actually banned  they just weren't played anymore.
They wanted to forget them, just like the word itself.
Public opinion produced what laws and proclamations had failed to achieve: just as in literature people chose to read heroic memoirs, cookbooks, and romance novels, they preferred ballads to music.
As the day went wild, Kevern began to tap the imaginary piano and sing serenades to Aileen's big legs with a cocky, comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller, Kevern told him, and he raised his two fingers in front of his mouth.
That's what his father had always done before the book of JJ got out of his lips.
It started as a game between him and his dad when he was a little boy.
His father told me he played the same game as his own father.
If you put a word in your mouth that starts with a "J" and you don't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you're gonna have to pay a penny.
It wasn't a fun game back then, and it wasn't fun anymore.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of that.
And the jazz wasn't even officially banned, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was out of fashion.
There was only room for one if-word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing happened to the witch.
The unpredictability of it made people nervous.
And jazz was the art of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Jr. by the age of 10, he had become acquainted with jazz music through his father's semi-classical CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Aileen's age, it's likely that she couldn't remember a time when popular singers weren't black.
This one, too, didn't need any laws or coercion.
A learned society meant that each of its members accepted as grateful  grateful, that they were like a savings made by the trading of happiness  the principle that each group did natural things for itself.
Because of their temperament and physical characteristics, people of African-Caribbean ancestry were best suited to entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian subcontinent, they were naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so their job was to make sure that every family had a working phone to handle matters.
The remaining members of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When THE FIRE, the FIRE, came true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not escaped in a frightful way in fear of being accused of sparking flames and of being caught next opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning a water pipe and continued their lives looking down on the ground, bored and depressed.
Let each one of you act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and he had difficulty understanding how the offensive words Kevern had just sung could ever be put into music.
Music was the expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", Kevern said.
Except maybe the big-footed people think so.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
Not a word would pass through the soundtrack of the giant leafy leaves of the pine trees.
But Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was gonna say this whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailyn.
Ailinn thought he was a freak already.
"It was funny to my father", he said instead.
Ailinn nodded his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
All you see in the world is Ailynn's huge, hairy, hairy face.
That's all she wanted to see.
If you say so, he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
The driver seemed to be really confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little bit...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you", but it was too soon.
I think you're attractive because of your fat ankles. She was trying to fix it.
I'm a bit twisted in that.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to amuse himself, the effect was quite different, for he, like his father, lacked the persuasive charm that can control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite her faint eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got up from his terrace chair, dropping the receiver and pouring the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was made of only a backpack, so he couldn't use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to vibrate like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
And your fat head is what's so pervertedly attractive to me about you, he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
The Government regretted Ailinn's actions, both for his own unnecessary cruelty and for the fear that appeared in his eyes when Ailinn decided to stand up to him.
Did Ailinn think he was gonna hit?
He had never told Kevern about life on the good northern island where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it was basically the same as life here.
The same huge, boiling sea that waved against them.
The same mixed men, though more slender and demonic than their smuggler and heretics after their assassination, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat up any woman who dared to resist or bully them.
- A fat head?
He'd still see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
Kissing first had become the most common word to describe erotic encounters between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads that pump out the receiver first suck and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, too, because sucking was itself hostile.
Ailinn Solomon's body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn felt exhausted too, but Kevern's depth of grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him as he went, just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go up through the window of the man who was the cause of his difficult life.
Adam was leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt compassion for Keverney and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to attack.
A backward, shy, shy, beaten man who had lost all battlefields... why did he feel that sight was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember ever having seen anything like it before?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, the brilliant and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the private Opinion Measurement Institute in Ofnow, conducted a brief study of the continuation of low- and moderate-level violence in areas of the country where violence reduction, or its end, was most likely given the money and energy spent to end it.
 Much has already been done, and much remains to be done, he wrote, to balance the natural aggression of the people who have fought and often won for thousands of years, especially in those abandoned and remote places where, despite the church towers that span the peninsula, human kindness has been rarely known over time.
But there are some things you can't completely eliminate.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
The people weep with sentimental ballads, they mourn stories of triumphant adversities, and they swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time, old-fashioned cruelty holds both rural and urban communities in its unquenchable grip, and there is evidence of a new, more vicious conflict in our homes, at our jobs, on our streets and even in amusement parks.
You must have a regrettable tendency to dramatize, his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down.
And I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't have to answer that question to believe", Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to the right not to answer personal questions.
What, a feminist?
There's silence again.
"I don't ask", Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
This is not a workplace bias.
We are the servants of a society without prejudice.
While some kind of hypersensitivity is itself completely acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, like the ones you just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the church, and what you call cruelty or malice is usually referred to by others as natural energy and physical strength.
Testing THAT WAS FIRED, FIRED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it ever happened, destroys the fundamental life force of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum was looking around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingo-red LED light declared the direction that Ofnow had been giving the country for the past quarter century or so.
Smile at your neighbor, respect your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, and a word sung is better than a written word; but love is not overcome.
I understand what you mean, but Esme Nussbaum responded in a quiet voice, when she was sure that her mentor had quit, and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we think we are.
I'm worried that if we're not warned, we'll find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to YOU being killed, being killed.
This time, though, we will not spill our hatred and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz built a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far", he said, "by making mistakes about the things our grandparents may or may not have done.
You're also going too far when you say they spilled their hatred and distrust on others.
Someone in a position like yours should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about us or the past.
There was no "we" or "other".
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
If we are to be completely honest, in this chaos, Esme dared to go on, no group in society can say that they behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done, was done, whether it was good or bad.
That was then.
We don't need to talk about it anymore. We agree.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, it is also unnecessary to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is some way to do them.
But what is the past for if it's not learned from it?
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing--
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
I'm going through your report, and he said and said it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as he was going to work as usual, he was hit by a stray motorcyclist on the sidewalk, described by passers-by as "crazy and furious".
Accidents are happening.
Lesotho's army denies plans to strike; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials in the Lesotho army have denied planning a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against police who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had besieged his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maserou.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after being told he had received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack, saying the army responded to the threat from political fanatics.
Lesotho's defense forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics who are ready to cause trouble, he told Voice of America.
According to Clayson Monyela, the president of the South African government, the military's actions looked like a revolutionary undertaking.
"While no one has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces show signs of a revolutionary campaign on all sides", he says.
Lesotho's army officials said the soldiers would return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital was in a calm mood.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjo Metz is in charge of the government while Thaban is away.
Thabane says he believes he's being targeted because he's been trying to fight corruption.
Tensions have been building in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions over disagreements with the government of a large coalition.
He denies that he has belittled the government's authority, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft is setting up a data centre in New Zealand
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in New Zealand, where the company declines to specify its location.
In a press release, Microsoft stated that it would not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
Microsoft says the center is already fully equipped and connected to the grid.
It's a multi-billion dollar investment for Microsoft.
In public, the center was formerly called Oulu or Kajan.
Microsoft is completely shutting down its Oulu office, taking about 500 people out of the job.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will be laying off a maximum of 1050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, communications director at Microsoft, told STT that the company would not comment on how many staff the new data center will employ.
The establishment of a data centre for New Zealand was announced by the Business Journal on Monday.

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you have a number of different equipment options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera, like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I took these pictures myself at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are some rules to follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are waterproof.
In addition, set the camera's camera settings to match the images or videos you're shooting.
Some cameras or a combination of camera and video camera have a setting that optimizes the conditions for underwater shooting.
 Also, before jumping into the water, make sure you can get your device to the depth.
Some cameras can only hold up to 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
Check out our purchase guide and digital camera reviews for both standard and waterproof models.
Take multiple pictures  many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have LCD displays that allow you to view the image, whereas action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and image matching can either succeed or fail.
So take a few pictures.
If your camera also allows for curving, which means taking multiple images at once in different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly dimming deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when photographing in a swimming pool, lake, or sea.
This also gives you more color in your pattern; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is important advice when shooting on land, but even more important underwater because the lighting conditions are low.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning that the camera must be close to the target to fill the entire frame.
China won't let Hong Kong choose its leaders
The Chinese parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters should not vote for candidates in the 2017 elections despite growing unrest demanding democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a glimpse into the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business district as activists begin planning and implementing protests only hours after the decision is announced.
The Chinese People's Congress' decision gives the Communists the power to virtually eliminate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still outrageous", says Democratic Party Chairwoman, lawmaker Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with an autonomous government.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese administration, saying that a general candidacy for the election of the Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised the people of the region that it would choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
China's leaders said Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough, as it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also made clear that China wants to tightly control the election process through a committee appointing officials from Beijing.
According to the new sentence, only candidates who love their country and love Hong Kong will be accepted.
In the summer leading up to the decision, some of the largest and most high-profile protests in the region in years were held in Hong Kong.
The pro-democracy campaign was largely behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business bloc unless Beijing grants Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was announced, hundreds of supporters of Occupy Central gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong headquarters.
In the protest, the organizers announced that the movement would enter a new era of non-citizenship and that they would cause waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently for fear that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a press release posted online, the organisers said that the movement would keep the Occupy Central movement as a last resort and would only be implemented if there was no hope for dialogue and no other way.
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has been lost and the conquest of the centre is about to take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security was tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, the unrest fuels the feeling that the people are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has created competition for products and services.
There is also a fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement for its manifestations of a threat to Hong Kong's lifestyle  business world.
The protest they are talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it will last says legislator Regina Ip, who has long been a critic of the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grasp.
I think that's a bad image for an investment.
Chinese state media have also reported stories that Hong Kong's democracy activists are the vassals of the Western powers of the revolutionary Lithuanian Republic.
This summer, activists organised an informal voting rights referendum, attended by 780,000 people  over a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
The American prom tradition hits British universities: private jet for new students
We are excited to meet this demand by launching the first luxury travel system in Britain for today's students.
In addition to the private jet, the company also offers other transport vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure a memorable arrival at the university.
Stewart said the service also has a security aspect.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their possessions across the country in loaded cars.
Combined with the many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students the easiest and highest possible transportation to the university.
The company representative said that reservations had not yet arrived as the service had just been set up, but added that students would start making orders in the coming weeks.
The company believes there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay £9,000 in tuition fees.
Today's students are very different in terms of their expectations and aspirations from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago, and it's more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Association criticizes the service, which is unrealistic.
According to Megan Dunne, Vice-President of the organisation's College of Education, 'this service plan seems to be very far from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are shocked by the level of living expenses, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has been left behind by the sharp rise in basic costs.
Ipswich's 'scattered house' for sale
Realtors removed the sales envelope of a house for sale in Suffolk after noticing a large pig lying in the living room of the house in the picture.
The one-bedroom house, priced at £120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The ad included a picture of the living room where the pig was lying on the couch.
Realtor Connells says the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
The image was accidentally entered into the notification and has since been removed, the company's representative says.
In the notice, Connells describes the former meeting house as a unique one-bedroom house.
Even though the real estate agency removed the image from their website, it still appears in the ads.
The sale of the house has generated interest on social media, asking if the pig is part of the house price.
Torres's departure is confirmed. Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund.
Spanish striker Fernando Torres was confirmed to be leaving Chelsea, but the substitute came in with almost the same opening.
Chelsea announced that they had signed a four-year contract with French-based Loic Remy's QPR neighborhood.
The price of the transaction is reportedly EUR 13 million.
Torres, 30, is moving to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool for a record £50million four years ago, but never lived up to expectations.
The final decision was also made by the failed tour of Japanese player Shinji Kagawa to Manchester United.
Kagawa is expected to return to German Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund, where he made his breakthrough before moving to ManU.
According to the press reports, the transaction price is around EUR 8 million.
Kagawa's newest contract is a four-year deal.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the League of Legends.
Now I'm happy to be the man of Dortmund again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment, Kagawa said.
The second Bundesliga club, the Duke of Berlin, is reinforced by the Balle de Salomon.
The Ivory Coast team's striker will move to Hertha from Lille, France, and the transfer is estimated to be worth around €3 million.
Before Lille Kalou, 29, played for Chelsea from 2006-12.
Eight dead in the Paris bombing
The death toll rose to eight on Monday after a flooring explosion in the Paris suburb.
In the accident that took place on Sunday in the suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois, 11 people were injured, four of them seriously.
Rescue workers are still searching for survivors from the ruins of the house on Monday, but hope for survivors has faded.
The initial cause of the explosion is a suspected gas leak.
The explosion occurred early Sunday and was so powerful that it knocked buildings over a hundred yards in radius.
Our whole house was moving. We were shaking in fear.
The explosion was so powerful that our ears rang", said Maryline Yyvo, who lives near the site.
On Sunday, an emergency shelter was already being built for the residents of the house near the school.

Bulgarian prison staff hold a national protest
Hundreds of prison workers throughout Bulgaria demonstrated in front of the Justice Ministry in Sofia, the capital.
In a peaceful protest, they expressed their desire to restore the old working rules, which were recently amended.
The increase is also to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
Prison officials have been symbolically protesting against new working hours for a month now, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite a meeting between the prison workers' association and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, according to Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, the head of the execution department, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told BNR.
The prison workers' union is expected to include members of the trade union of interior ministry workers.
Basketball: Fans almost over-motivated: Sasu Salin was fainting on the field
Basketball, Sasu Salin, was the embodiment of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his US-led fight and bleed Ukraine's second half with his stalemate.
But Salin gave all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I was going to faint on that field at the end, that encouragement was so great.
I could see nothing but the fog.
The noise and the white audience was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments kept nine surfaces in a fast-paced fashion, balls, plates and a scratch everywhere it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow state where everything worked out.
They'll just come from somewhere, now, somewhere very important, Sasu said.
It's my part.
Do all that stuff.
Now it was great to see the others getting their hands on the plot.
It's all over the gang.
Salin is the team's cheerleader and creator of spirits, so it's no wonder his example took the entire team on a flight that was too big for the big, tough-ass Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of absence: The previous game was remembered as a brutal refereeing match
Heikki Montonen (oik.) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men's national football team last played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish striker to play in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second-team coach and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing from the tournament, like yesterday: it was a fiery match against France in the opening round.
"The refereeing game was a rough one on the deciding balls of that match", Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams were already in the back row.
Suddenly, the game was resumed.
We lost it 2-3 and then the shit went crazy even more", Parkkali said.
Finland played under head coach Heikki Montosen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is once again among the world's favourites, as the World Cup in Poland kicks off on Saturday.
There's been a lot of dramatic change in international football in 32 years.
The strengths of the players are about the same as before, but the quality and skill is more.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is even faster", Parkkali thought.
But what about Poland?
The Finnish players' equipment has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I hope Finland can continue from the initial stage.
Then you can get tough", Kosonen says.
The Seppo Circus
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were on strike in a victorious match against Tunisia.
The current player agent, Jouni Parkkali, was a general player at the World Cup.
Let's hope we're cheating on the 17th.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down", Parkkali said.
Lajilegenda Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Korkö were the fans of the Tunisian game.
The sauna and evening practice at the Church of the Sailor in Buenos Aires were part of the national team's program for the 1982 World Cup.
Kari (oik) was training with his teammates.
The final of the Young Star Song Contest contested ... no victory for South Karyana
Veera Vento and Veeti Tikkanen, who reached the final of the Young Star singing competition, did not advance to the competition.
Other investments were not published in the competition.
According to Teija Immosen, a singing teacher, the competition has been popular.
It's a good experience.
The finalists will still be recording the songs of the competition.
"Immone always has a great memory of competitive time".
Finnish tourists rescued Cita from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the credit"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog were stranded in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini courageously offered to help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen searched Facebook for "international heroes" to thank his supporters once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook post that the Cita dog he was with on Thursday in the mountains hurt his pocket.
The injured dog could no longer walk in the rough terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure it in and pull it a little forward, but it just didn't carry its feet, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said no help came from the police, no hotel nearby, no passersby.
By the time it got dark, the situation was starting to look threatening.
Fortunately, two walkers who were willing to help arrived: Antti Soini, a Tamperine, and her father, Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway, Galdhøpiggen, and were heading for their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm about the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini says in a message to the Night-Tell.
Soon a German man with a tourist boat was also present.
The bed on Cital was filled with pairs of pairs that were attached to the injured dog.
A German man arrived a moment after us, as we were thinking about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the alley for a moment, Soini says.
The sound of the sound of the trumpet
The dog was brought down with a scooter.
Soin said the performance was not physically heavy, but in difficult terrain, the carrying was slow.
However, after about an hour and a half, Cita was successfully brought down.
After that, Mikkelsen continued to search Facebook for "international heroes" so he could thank them once again.
The sounds did respond to him on Sunday, but the German is still apparently missing.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I haven't thanked them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, and I will be forever grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the Sounds were already on their way home.
They had received a cheerful response from Mikkelsen, saying, "Cita is already feeling better".
Susanna Mkki is being introduced as the superstar of the Helsinki City Orchestra

He is an internationally renowned chamber music master and won the Pro Finlandia medal in 2011.
John Storgårds is currently the principal conductor of the city orchestra.
The beautiful and brave series The beautiful and the brave is back on the air today after the summer break.
The name that suggests the opening season raises questions.
The most popular soap opera in Finland ever, The Beautiful and the Brave, is back this summer.
The name of the return period is, impliedly, "Oral happiness with Eric".
The evening programming description of the episode is as follows:
Eric and Donna discuss family relationships, order a piece of pickle, drink white wine, and recall their love stories.
Eric is loyal to his necklace style.
He's chosen a white shirt that lights up for lunch.
Ridge is offering Katie support in dealing with the trauma caused by Brooke and Bill's relationship.
Ridge hasn't gotten over his problems yet.
Bill's in Brookline working out his own differences.
Brooke doesn't like a man going in there trying to get her back.
"I want Ridge, not you, Bill".
A genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman had been afraid of death for years because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers spent most of her youth thinking that she had only a few years to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited diseases that damage the brain and the external nerves of the spinal cord.
According to the charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from CMT, a disease that causes motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and tingling of the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he'd be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and dead before he turned 30.
Now a 51-year-old mother of two, she says that as a child, I knew I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and I took longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
At the age of 13, Rodgers underwent several acupuncture operations to straighten his legs, and after the doctor left the room, he quickly reviewed his research papers, which said he had FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA", she says.
When I got the information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the time I turned 18, and I'd die before I turned 25, and in between, I'd gradually lose all my functioning.
I went through this myself, and I designed my own funeral.
Rodgers relates that by the age of 17, he realized that his walking had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair already".
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Some genetic tests showed that he had CMT.
"When I was told what CMT is, I thought I was postponing it", she says.
Charity CMT UK is organising a CMT month to raise awareness of the disease.
One hundred migrants found in a coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a coal-carrying train, the interior ministry said on Monday.
The Salaam refugees were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late on Sunday in Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from and where they were going", said Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about EUR 3,000 each to get to Greece and another EUR 800 to 900 to get to Serbia.
A couple of million people pass through Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody Syrian civil war.
The Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai supporting Scottish independence
The Popes Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined the supporters of Scottish independence.
According to the Guardian, the bands will be performing a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence movement.
The Scottish independence referendum is due to take place on 18 September.
In his press release, Mogwai said the vote was an opportunity for Scots that only happens once in a lifetime.
In the past, actor Sean Connery has supported independence.
Instead, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to the Scots to remain part of Britain.
In the Gallupe, the independenceists have been losing.
The hardships in the department stores continued through the middle of the summer
The downturn in the goods trade continued in July, says the daily grocery store.
It also noted that the sales of the supermarket chains and the supermarket chain decreased by 3,2% in July.
The worst hit was the sale of home and leisure products, which declined by more than 7% year on year.
Apparel sales were also significantly lower than last summer.
On the other hand, the value of daily retail sales increased by almost 3% in July from a year ago.
The biggest sales were in small shops and supermarkets.
During the whole year, which ran from January to July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets decreased by more than 2%.
On the other hand, sales of everyday goods have increased by almost one percent.
Joan Rivers' family wishes the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a hospital in downtown New York, but her daughter was hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian would recover.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers wrote today.
We hope for the best.
His mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday for cardiac arrest, and sources said the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic in Upper East Side, a nursing home at the time, had declared an emergency at the hospital.
Doctors will intentionally calm him with medication and monitor his condition until his current serious condition is stable.
The case has generated a wide public reaction, with Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa, for example, offering support online.
Areva-Siemens: The three-stage reactor will be completed in mid-2016.
Areva has provided the Industrial Power TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3.
According to the Areva Communication, the recent delays in the project have been mainly due to the approval of the reactor's automation systems.
The project is already years behind schedule.
In May, TVO did not provide any estimate of the time frame for the third reactor.
Nastola donated a 1.4 hectare beach estate to Bottaks worth about EUR 60000
The municipality of Nastola donated a formula truck to Valtteri Bottaks for a 1.4 hectare beachfront on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi from Villähte.
The Municipal Government has shown fairness in its sporting attitude and has been unanimous in its decision.
The noise was not heard at the meeting when the land was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
The Bottas gift shop has farm buildings, seven pieces in all.
The city will be dismantling them again this year, with one exception.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the estate within two years.
We're all so taken to the fact that she's enjoying her nanny and wants to be here in return.
Every year, Valtteri has been to the elementary school telling the story of his sports career and life.
And I hope it continues, says the mayor.
The mayor estimates the cash value of the beachfront at EUR 40000-60000.
The beach is low and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for a good ten years.
Nastola has, with varying success over the decades, kept the sporting successes in the municipality with gift baskets.
World champion Aki Parviainen and world champion Windy Matinsalo in aerobics built their own houses and built their own empty houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola. They sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola to pursue their work and then moved to another place after the change in circumstances.
Bottas is a teenager by birth and his situation is different, Syyrak is a little bit of a bitch and believes Bottas will stay in his home town.
The madman beat the attacker with a record amount of Hernandez's team.
Valioliigaseura Hull invested the club's record amount in the acquisition of Uruguayan national team player Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez is trading the Italian firm Palermo for Hulli for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
It's a three-year deal.
Last season, Hernandez scored 14 goals as Palermo won the Serie B and advanced to the Italian top flight.
He has scored seven goals in 14 matches for the Uruguay national team.
Last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came on two matches in a trade.
"Abel is a fantastic acquisition and a testament to how far we've come in a short time", said Steve Bruce, head coach of the Hults.
On Monday, Hull announced that he had also acquired Senegal's captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
The Russian spacecraft failed . The geeks sent on the sex trip died .
Five small geckos sent to Russian space to reproduce have died, the Russian Federation's Roscosmos space agency said in a statement.
The geeks traveled on the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning, Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless environment.
One male and four female participants participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment may sound bizarre, it was meant to be.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of eggs, for example, in goats.
The effects on geeks can be used to predict the effects of weightlessness on humans for longer periods of time in a similar state, illustrated by the New Statesman in July.
Roscosmos says the time of the geeks' death and the cause of death or causes are being investigated.
According to Interfax, the passengers who were "crossed" as "sex-geeks" froze.
Another surprise is that the fruit flies on the same Foton-M4 fleet survived the journey without difficulty and also received a boost.
France arrested a suspected terrorist at Nizan airport
France arrested a suspect in terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of recruiting a jihadist group operating in Syria.
The French authorities informed us on Sunday.
Authorities tracked down the man after he had lured a 16-year-old girl to Syria with money.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her intentions, and told the authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
Authorities say the man is from Chechnya, but he's now living in France.
The French intelligence had followed the man's actions earlier.
In France, the authorities have expressed concern that radicalised youths who have been drawn into the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Officials estimate that about 800 French citizens or books in France have travelled to Syria during the last conflict, returned from there or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
We have a good chance of winning.
The basketball team's future hopes are at stake as Finland meets Ukraine in their second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening bid was expected for the United States, Ukraine would be among the countries from which Finland would continue to receive the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicted.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first match of the tournament on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who is in charge of Ukraine's offensive basketball team.
The key player in Ukraine is the head coach Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the three-year-old world champion in the 100 meters.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter is a quick guy, but we've played against guys like that before, and we need to get our standard defense in shape, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttöla has promised that Finland will play better than they did yesterday in their loss to the United States.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee you'll see a normal wolf pack on the field, said the Mottó.
The alleged nude photos of Hollywood stars are being circulated online . Part of them confirmed to be real .
A number of nude images are circulating on the Internet that are said to depict well-known public figures.
Among other things, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "naked-out campaign".
Entertainment website TMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence's representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a gross violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted and anyone posting stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, officials threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the photos she's taking are authentic.
She took those pictures years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the terrible trouble that was seen for this.
I feel sorry for everyone who was hacked, she writes on her website.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice says that her own name is a fake.
There are also real or fake nude photos of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grand, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsk and Teresa Palmer.
The honka-painting guard criticizes his own people: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
The football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliga.
The comments by painter Walter Vitale after Sunday's VPS match illustrate the current confusing situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeping coach in four months.
But everything has to adapt", Viitala said after the fight ended in a 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
The goalkeeper Viitala wasn't too happy about playing defense.
The number of players in Hong Kong has been very high this summer, and that is why the defenders in front of the Viitalan have also changed at a steady pace.
With the advent of roulette, many young players have also been given opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some don't work hard enough to get out of here", Viitala said without naming any individual players.
Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and play games and have fun and think you're a betting league player and don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team", Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that position and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players cannot expect immediate success when their peers are constantly changing.
This season has not been the same meeting twice in a row.
Especially on the defensive line, the gang's changed.
That's the main reason we're here", Kuqi said.
Honka's a series regular after the loss of the VPS, tied for second with the last TPS.
There's seven rounds left in the Super League, so the Espoo's still got time to avoid falling to Division One.
I've never put a team down, and I'm not going to put a team down.
We're definitely not going to drop out of this series", goalkeeper Viitala threatened.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after a break of decades
Film director Lars von Trier is planning to return to television as a producer.
A Danish director is working on a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
The series was announced by Louise Vesth, who produced Trier's films, at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
According to the Zentrop production company, the series should start filming in 2016.
Trier is reportedly set to begin writing the series this fall.
The series is in English.
The mystery is also the subject of a press release by Trier's longtime partner, producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen, known for his tough sales pitches.
He said that a similar series "has never been seen or will ever be seen".
"Hold your breath", says Aalbæk Jensen in the press release.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known for his recent high-profile media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the television series Kingdom.
The Finnish side appears to have been taken over by Lidl, at least if the results are to be believed.
The turnover of Lidl Finland Kommandittiyhtiö, the Finnish trading group operating Lidl, continued to increase during the financial year ended at the end of February.
The company also increased its revenue.
Pre-tax income was EUR 79.6 million, up from EUR 56.4 million earlier that year.
The turnover increased from EUR 960 million to EUR 1.2 billion.
It's up 25 percent.
The company, which increased its market share, also improved its turnover from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The profit margin was 7.1 percent.
The accounting period for Lidl, a German company, runs from March to February.
The company said it paid EUR 13,7 million in tax to Finland for the financial year ended in February.
The company, which has continuously expanded its retail chain, has announced that it will invest EUR 100 million in Finland this year.
There are currently 142 Lidl shops in Finland and it employs over 4 000 people.
The first stores opened in 2002.
A participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge is cutting his or her position
British Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when she was hit with cold water that she damaged her facial bone.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to hospital after she screamed at the Ice Bucket interview so loudly that her spleen was reversed.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when she was hit by icy water that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just screamed, but as I screamed, I felt my lymphoma start to get stiff", she tells The Mirror magazine.
Ice is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident .
I tried to shut up, but I couldn't, my leuka was locked up, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sisters noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the ER.
The 20-year-old Briton, who took part in the super-supported challenge on Tuesday, was taken to hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
The video has become an Internet sensation, and it's been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
View of wolf howling: How can the increase in fan numbers be explained?
I had a really great day today.
That was the statement made by basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995 when Finland played France in the final of the European Championship in the Athena Marousse ball.
I'm not exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about 100 Finns who shouted 20,000 spectators to the hall, otherwise empty.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later, after the World Cup match between Finland and Ukraine?
In Bilbao, the Finnish army of 100 is eighty times that.
The 1995 European Championship was the golden age of Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final race by winning, among other things, the Russian knockout at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That win would open the door to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Motto.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann put Möttöla on the limelight for the finals team.
A solution many disagreed with.
Now, you could say that Dettmann was far from wise, even though everything didn't go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team went under.
At the Athens Games, the Finns reportedly attended a little over a hundred.
Among them were journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are reporters, relatives, coaches in Bilbao, but there are fans.
And there are many of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I don't think anyone can tell you the exact number of Finnish tourists.
The estimates have ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever number was in between, it's a totally incomprehensible number.
Here's an explanation for the sports sociologists.
In a global economy, businesses are moving across borders.
The sport still has a chance to see how we're doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can start to see how our daughters and sons are doing in the world", says Hannu Teakonen, a professor of exercise sociology.
I'm sure there are Finns in Spain and in Poland who are looking for a living.
We have a common experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
Sports itself must be attractive.
Crying is a part of sports culture.
There's a lower threshold to go to sports lectures than to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses can't move.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and the players to get into the top-tier of the sport professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the ground crew was put on the pedestal.
The pilot made the same move a little earlier.
Now they're both enjoying the fruits of their labor.
As Tearner says, both breeds have succeeded in producing their top sport, which is governed by the Holy Trinity: sports media sponsors.
That's when the audience gets interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnivalist support is, Tears reminds us.
Can the ball sport also spread this massive interest to home games?
On average, the game of volleyball and volleyball is played with hundreds or slightly more than 1,000 spectators.
Crying considers the question a good one, and it may not necessarily give an answer that promises very good things for the species.
The other school group believes interest is shifting.
The other one is the one who doesn't want a full stomach of sweet.
This team is ready for the World Cup, but in their basic minds, they're not interested in the home series.
It's a challenge for the people who follow you in the middle of a drug deal.
Security for Bottas farm, almost 1.5 hectares of lake shore.
Nastola is rewarding Formula One driver Valtteri Botts with a beach-side ticket.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of the 1.4 hectare plot at its meeting on Monday.
We're gonna have a holiday home up there in the future.
The Bottas' success has been traced in the Nastolas since the days of karting.
He's a good ambassador to market the Gulf, the Gulf region and Nastola.
The gift box is located in Koiskala, on the shores of Lake Kärk.
It's now owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
The region has seven buildings in disrepair, six of which will be dismantled by the end of this year at the expense of the municipality.
Bottas won his fourth prize in the Belgian Formula One Championship this year.
He's fifth in the points standings.
Bottas is a teenager who spent his childhood in Villähte.
He's now living in England, but he goes to Nostollah whenever he's free of formula.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth facilities.
Smart design clothes are coming , but hardly for the poor .
It's presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York.
Ralph Lauren's intelligence testers are the ballplayers on the field, but so does Marcus Giron, one of the most highly-regarded amateur college players.
She says the shirt helps her monitor her own development and regulate her recovery.
The woven silver sensors are woven into the fabric of the shirt and transmitted to the smartphone or tablet computer.
The sensors measure heart rate, breathing rate, stress and steps.
The central unit shall be removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given an exact date for the shirt's launch, nor has it even hinted at its price, Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren isn't the only company that's investing in smart clothes.
Athos, California, has brought smart shirts and smart shorts to the market.
They measure your blood pressure, breathing, and muscle work.
The cost of the clothes is $100 a piece, and the center unit the size of the thumb they require is $200.

A Smart Way to Save in Textbooks
The cost of college in America is over $1,000 for many students, so soon-to-be second-year student Matt Schroeder came up with a clever way to save on expenses.
He developed a system where students of the next year borrowed their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them immediately.
"My math book would normally cost $180, but I paid $10 for the entire semester and spent a sandwich", says 19-year-old Schroeder, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester's books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on it.
According to the university's board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce those costs.
Students are increasingly using online shops and creative approaches like Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, which allows them to use the book throughout the semester and pay for it significantly less than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc., which owns more than 250 campus bookshops, book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Statistics for the sector reveal that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were leased last spring, says Trevor Meyer, chairman of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here's the simplest way to save money.
Online shops
In online stores, you can only get a new book for a third of the price it would cost at a campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler's book Calculus is nearly $290, but the online specialty book store Chegg.com offers a price tag of $239.99.
Buy as used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other people's notes or outdated appearance.
For example, the Calculus book is available for $93.49 from Chegg.com's online store.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he bought the book Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business for just $0.42 from an online store on Amazon.com.
If I had a new book, it would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if past pressures can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms in the new edition are not essential to teaching.
In this case, the old print can only be found at a fraction of the price that a new one should pay.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is a popular secondhand bookstore.
Rental
If you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course, renting them out is worth considering.
You can save more than 80% on the price of a new book by renting it.
For example, renting a Calculus book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Learn the rules of the rental company, such as notes, use of the credit card and expenses incurred.
If you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price.
E-books
The question of obtaining e-books instead of regular paperwork may also be raised.
Sometimes these books are rented out to pay for the e-book's access to the owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg, or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg's shop will be able to get a Calculus e-book for six months for about $61.
Bracey says that many literature students save the most because many classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors is worthwhile, regardless of the choice.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start Pepperdine Law, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it can help ensure that you're looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is in the warehouse, says Gault.
He learned this from the way he was carrying it.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to buy the book at full price from the university bookstore.
The Tampere Legionateater is 20 years old
The theatre, founded in 1994, is an anti-unemployment, exclusion and passivity movement.
The event is open to anyone who wants to make a performing art.
Provides a free, free and open-air leisure activity for the long-term unemployed aged 17 to 35.
The performances often take a stand for society.
In recent years, it has been featuring such subjects as depression-related depression, moderate depression, and I Like It! humorous narratives about narcissism and classic advice.
He believes that every human being can change his own life.
Almost double the number of people killed in fires last year
This year, fires have killed nearly twice as many people as last year.
According to the media survey by the Finnish Salvation Society's (Spek) Central Organization, 55 people have died in 49 fires so far.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, were men.
There have been 11 over 65.
The organization's fire death statistics show that the worst case was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
Most of the deaths in fires are in the apartments.
There have been 17 fires in the apartment buildings, 21 in the private houses, and seven in the row houses and other small houses.
The speck reminds me of a repeat of home fire safety.
At least the fire alarm system in the home should be working, Speck says.
In addition, all should check that the starting switches are easily deployable.
There must also be an unobstructed exit route from all premises.
Children should also be told what electrical devices they can use when alone at home.
The first protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was called the anti-aircraft rally.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events of the weekend and spoke to protesters who had arrived as far away as Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
TWO teenage hikers were taken to safety after being trapped at night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went for a walk after noon on Sunday at Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
The family were concerned about the young ones who had not returned home and called the police at eight o'clock in the evening.
A search party of local police and aid workers was sent to search for the young men, and two were found around 11:00 p.m. near the Bridal Veil Falls.
She had hurt her knee, and he had fallen and hit his head.
The cops spent the night with the couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian troops withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
The Ukrainian army says the soldiers were ordered to withdraw.
Ukraine says the paratroopers have been in a tight clash with Russian tanks in the field.
A military spokesman said the enemy's fire was so precise that it was likely Russian professional soldiers who fired the gun.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
A Ukrainian patrol vessel that was hit by cannon fire yesterday in the Aswan Sea off the southeastern coast of Ukraine sank this morning, the border guard said.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Patrol wasn't sure where the ship was fired from.
The separatists said on social media yesterday they shot the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian troops should withdraw immediately to positions where they cannot fire on civilians.
The Foreign Minister said that the Minsk negotiations today should lead to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between Russia, Ukraine and Ethiopia.
Lavrov also stressed that Russia will respond to any new economic sanctions.
First, we're going to protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains flooded Malmö and Copenhagen
On Sunday, streets in Malmö and Copenhagen were flooded as heavy rains swept through southern Sweden and Denmark.
Flooding cut off several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars in the desert.
Officials estimated Sunday that the flood control could last, even though rainfall was forecast to stop on Monday.
Heavy rains came as a surprise to the Swedish authorities, and no weather warnings were issued for the rain.
Meteorologist Ari Mustala, a friend of the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimates that the landslide that affected the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stable.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should be silent and help France, says Francois Hollande's chief supporter
Valls called on the deeply divided left to show his feelings towards a struggling socialist president whose new government was not approved by the French majority.
The president deserves all the respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side", Valls said, earning him a standing ovation.
In a calming move, the Prime Minister demanded that the government leave the French 35-hour working week alone despite a controversial proposal by the new finance minister, Emmanuel Macron, earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to work with the government of the joint session.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused a split by the appearance of a meeting of dissenting Socialist representatives and by criticising the Socialist Party for allowing France to give up hope for the future.
Marine Le Pen, head of the National Front of the Trade Right, mocked the socialists' continued disunity and said she did not believe the new government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not last even a summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter", Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to dissolve the parliament and held his party's election victory in early elections certain and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The ruling party in France suffered a crush in the March municipal elections and the far right held a leading position in the May EU elections.
According to a survey by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may split into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Paris, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and to raise unemployment to record levels.
There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to quickly realize that change is happening, he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
The show was badly betrayed by the Finnish planners Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda.
Tomorrow Finland has posted a funny video on its Facebook page on Thursday.
In the video, the planners Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the next day's broadcast of the Tomorrow Finnish advertising buff, but the recording does not go to waste.
Alm-Siira is confused when he tries to say the word budgetary, and his confusion causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their temper again and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live even tomorrow, says the Facebook update for Tomorrow Finland.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared on Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked in the newspaper's photography office, placed third in the series of portraits in 1972.
The picture is of Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
In May 1971, a meeting of the Socialist International was held at the House of Building Masters on Helsinki's Fredrikinkaad.
There were many heads of state at the meeting, and security was huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven guards went with her.
But at the beginning of the meeting, we had plenty of time to film.
I took this picture four or five meters away.
The light and the background were in place.
I knew right away that this time I had it.
From the looks of Meir, it's clear that Middle Eastern leaders have had a hard time in the past.
You'd be able to compete with a famous person or event with pictures taken.
It's great that you can now be successful with other images as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is a picture of Lasse Viren falling from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send that to the contest.
Claim: The Aarnio investigation has already paid more than EUR 5 million
The legal investigation of the activities of the Helsinki Police's drug unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30 to 50 years of staff work.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki said in his paper on computer science at the University of Jyväskylä.
The Commission considers that the Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of electronic communications networks is not in line with the objectives of the directive.
The limit is that modern technology allows for multiple uses of criminal material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where the information collected for the investigation of a crime is automatically an electronic evidence supply that fills the chain of evidence, while enabling comprehensive law enforcement.
The complaint will be reviewed on Saturday.
General: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken on the vegetable diet"
A photo of a special message on the wall of the Uppsala Women's School caused a stir on social media, Yle reports on its website.
The vegetarians!
The vegetarian diet includes fish and chicken.
Only when there's meat on the list, do we make a vegetable alternative!
That's what you see on the school wall, forgotten, 15 years old.
You can see the picture from here.
The image spread on social media has led people to send angry feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Director of the Food and Sanitation Department, Arja Vaarma, tells Yelle that the note left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came here, there was this idea that was discussed with the health care community.
Every student gets a meal they want, he tells Yelle.
Today, in Pirkkalan schools, students are only offered a vegetarian diet option with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or healthcare professional.
The risk justifies the solution to Yelle by suggesting that the plant-based dietary experiments of young people may leave them undernourished and that the lack of meat or chicken may arouse the curiosity of the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise is close to a $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, the world's third largest cruise line, is in talks to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion, based on information from people closely involved.
The sale would allow Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, to use Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise and wealthy customers in its continued competition against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The sources say that information on a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, but it is also possible that the negotiations will not lead to a result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations are not going to be public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and an Apollo representative declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, which operates in Miami, has 13 cruise ships covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13% between 2012 and 2013, when it had a turnover of US$ 2,57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, up 6% from the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of middle class economies in the coming years, such as China and India.
Companies are competing to be the first choice for these new customers when choosing cruising.
Prestige Cruises has registered its first issue of shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned the majority of the company since the 2007 transaction, valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 as part of its current merger with the merged cruise company Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the latter being the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
According to the disclosed information, Genting's stake in the company was 28%, Apollo's 20% and TPG Capital LP's 8% from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise of North American cruise capacity is 82%, according to the registration document published on the occasion of the issuance of Prestige Cruise shares.
The Tampere city council is considering the matter today.
The animal is asking the city to give its strongest support to the initiative.
According to Salla Judgment Risk, Director of Animal Activities, who is working on a PhD at the University of Tampere, the dolphinarium period in Finland and around the world should end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, the view has become widespread around the world that the concentration of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither animal-friendly nor ethically sustainable.
I hope that this view will be taken up in Tampere.
The Commission considers that the Commission's decision to withdraw the aid from the scheme is not only a matter of animal rights but also of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination.
The verdict says the death of the sighted dolphin confirms the requirements for the low-life dolphin.
I see this death as a sad continuation of the dark history of the Dolphinarium of the Swallow.
It is time to put a stop to deaths, close the dolphin prison and start figuring out how to move Tampere dolphins to a bordered marine area, a sort of dolphin shelter, the judgment demands.
The sight did not have time to return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins in the Swallow will have time to experience life beyond their unobstructed concrete, Judge Hazara hopes.
Animal Welfare Union The aim of the Animal Welfare Act is to prohibit the use of all wild animal species in circuses as a whole.
This includes dolphins.
To support the request, the Animal Director, Judgmental Danger, is taking part in a demonstration on behalf of the dolphins on the 1st of September.
The demonstration organised by the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take place against the ongoing period of dolphin hunting in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are cruelly captured or killed each year, either for use as dolphins or for food.
Putin demands that Kiev open negotiations with the eastern Ukraine on a new state
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government end its fight against separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the separation of the territory, Russian news sources reported.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-held eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine would need to be reconsidered in order to empower the Russian-speaking population to defend their rights and interests.
Putin's demand for negotiations with the Kiev government as an equal partner to the Russian-minded rebels is in line with his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared Novorossia independence so that it can move to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state TV channel Channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military's attempts to recapture separatist-held eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which separatists seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula itself on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently christened the region as "Novorossiya", "New Russia", a term that recalls the glorious days before the Russian Revolution.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tassin, Putin said the planned peace talks are a "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians campaign for the October 26 parliamentary elections and government forces attack civilians in separatist-held areas.
We must immediately start wide-ranging negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the role of the state in southeastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there, he said.
Mr Peskov said that Putin's reference to 'statehood' was linked to wider independence, which had been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership in an attempt to ease fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Member States is not yet in force.
The Kremlin representative's interim remark, intended to correct the misinterpretation of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian administration is dealing with the separatist insurgency in the Eastern regions differently from Crimea, which in practice is considered to have taken over a region with an ethnic majority of 2 million people.
Moscow would find it much more difficult to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because pre-conflict opinion polls showed that most of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give the local authorities of Ukraine the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin in practice the power to take over the territory that connects Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main navy, commercial shipping ports, and historic coastal sites.
The area between Rostov and Crimea in Russia also includes mines, factories and metal insulators that produce vital products for the Russian military.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that after the new elections, Ukrainian legislators consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making power of the regions that are moving away from the Ukrainian core region on their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence appears to be sharply different from that of the Kremlin and perhaps the armed and unarmed separatists of Moscow.
Putin made his latest demand to the Kiev government to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops penetrated eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region on the coast of the Sea of Azov.
The security authorities of Ukraine fear that the capture of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsk is the beginning of a larger effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal region as far as Crimea.
This has led to the massive civilian and military buildup of Mariupol, a city of half a million people known as a steel-producing port city, located between Novoazovsk and the Crimean peninsula on a narrow strip of land.
Mr Poroshenko spoke to the European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for further action to prevent further Russian attacks in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return", Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any direct action decisions; the leaders proposed additional sanctions to be introduced should the crisis in Ukraine recede under uncertain circumstances.
Ukrainian troops were forced to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 troops moved to the Donetsk region last week to reinforce the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first Russian to land on the island of Ilovaisk, 63 Ukrainian soldiers were exchanged for 10 Russian parachutists who were captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago.
The opening painting for Milan was done by the Japanese driver Keisuke Honda in the seventh game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was hit first and a little later, Jeremy Menez was hit by a penalty kick.
Laziok was also given a hard time in the final seconds of the game after his shrinking, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez refused to fire Antonio Candreva.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In the first training session of Milan's former attacking icon Inzaghi, the San Siro stadium was only halfway.
The match was watched by 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the wake of the nude scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he was embarrassed by hackers who may have stolen his fiancee and nude photos of Hollywood A-list star Gabi Greck.
The entertainment industry has been booming since a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted online following a widespread public image hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of Star Trek star Lawrence and other superstars, including top models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grand and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Greco from Melbourne have also been apparently stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grec last month, told Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting.
All personal contact and photos should be kept private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and distributed.
Grecko, New York, is reported to have commented on the case in an online magazine as "embarrassing" and said the victims "feel themselves despised".
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of Palmer in an uncovered pool at the edge of the lake.
Palmer's film credits include Love and Honor with actor Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman told TMZ that the incident involved a blatant violation of privacy.
Actor Seth Rogen was angry with the hacker in his tweet: "Publishing stolen photos on a mobile phone is no different than selling a stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, just from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like home and won a sensational victory over Cuba in the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fan booze.
Katowice, Poland, was white on Monday: not a Polish red white, but a Finnish blue white.
According to STT, almost 2000 Finnish players followed Finland's victory at the Spodek Arena.
I felt like I was playing on the home court.
That's how much influence the fans had on our game, Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland had already lost the match by a margin of 0-2, but they had won by a margin of 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland scored six points behind the rest of the field.
Cuba led 16-10 but then the Finns got the charm.
However, the Finnish airline Parisataa was disappointed when the charter plane was unable to land due to the heavy fog in Katowice.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the game.
The Finnish football fans have been conquering Europe at a rapid pace in recent days.
At the World Cup in Bilbao, Spain, more than 8,000 Finnish fans are present.
As if every Finnish ball had been a match winner, US star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish fans after the match on Saturday.
The Council meeting is not broadcast live due to technical problems
The meeting of the Kouvola City Council cannot be viewed online today as a live broadcast.
According to the city, the shipment is not possible due to technical problems.
The city of Kouvola is sorry for the situation.
The backup can check in a couple of days from the meeting.
The meetings of the Kouvola City Council were viewed online at the beginning of the year.
The Commission will also consider whether the measures are compatible with the internal market.
The videos of the Council meeting can be found at http://www.kouvola.fi/index/adult population/partnership/official website.html and on the YouTube channel of Kouvola City.
