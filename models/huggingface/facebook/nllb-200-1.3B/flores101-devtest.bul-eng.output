Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's now widely accepted, but it also gives details that fossils generally don't provide, like color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists believe that the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed handle called a rachis, but do have other feather features  branches and hooks, the researchers conclude that the rachis is probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature control or parade, and according to the researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult specimen, not chicken feathers.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not the pubic hair of a young individual.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that it affects ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around a halo-shaped galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

They are colder than the neighboring surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal state is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Traditionally, voting in France has been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth, identify their chosen candidate on a pre-printed sheet of paper and place it in an envelope.
Once the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, he or she places an envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral list.
French electoral law is quite strict about the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are released except for those of duly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

But the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the crash happened has been temporarily closed so that emergency services can get the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adecco has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any testimony could be discredited because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs as potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems journalists are moving in a dangerous direction if they distribute pictures and so on of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for prosecuting the case, told reporters that it would not comment further until charges were filed.
According to the leaked information, the document will relate to the border dispute that Palestine is seeking based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other subjects discussed are supposed to be the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both sides, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
After signing the agreement, Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agreed to have such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was observed and its efficacy assessed.
The Australian Shooting Association hunting programme has recruited skilled volunteers in partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooting Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at the National Park Service, the four shooters selected for the first shot have been given detailed safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in to the nine-member new interim election board yesterday.
This is the fifth interim council election in Martelli in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous election commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country to new elections.
Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October was the commission.
Violent protests have sometimes been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 incidents of iPod devices malfunctioning, overheating, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "a real regret".
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 07:19 am local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency has reported no damage to the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are now at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and adults, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm birth in her spare time.
His research shows that if you apply a hormone, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lung.
Government investigators discovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
It was a tribute to Luna and fellow fighters.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moona was the first Queen of Extremism. My first manager. Moona went away on the night of the two moons.
"The moon is as strange as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place", comments Dustin Goldust Runnels.
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose the idea of Australia becoming a republic have risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
After all, 29% of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and compete in three relay events at the British Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his physical condition is in question.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to deal with the pain, because it was banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest known prime number yet.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various software and hardware before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, after comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to enable flight controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and to determine the exact location of aircraft.
No additional transport is provided and no ground trains will stop at Wembley, and there is no parking or parking with the possibility of leaving the vehicle.
Fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A new bird species has appeared in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, reports a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process took much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium-sized earth finch (Geospiza fortis), and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape, it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled as a thin wire, which can be knitted and twisted, and then it can be forged or wrapped in sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books known as illuminated manuscripts.
This is the pH of a chemical, and using the juice of a cabbage, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is, the juice changes color.
The amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons, with electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, you'll feel it a little strange, and it'll form something like a shell.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-daro had running water toilets in almost every house, connected by a complex sewer system.
In the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, remains of sewer systems have been found in homes.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women in mixed company would gather together.
You use satellite when you're calling someone thousands of miles away.
The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly bounces it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The bike has changed the world in an incredible way, and the greatest thing we have because of the bike is much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, the special job that each cat takes on, which keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called pride.
The larvae consist of one to three adult blood-related males, along with up to 30 females and juveniles.
The women are usually close-knit, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides act much like pack wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a well-rounded athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, make huge jumps, and pull with the strength of five healthy people.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that are known to roar.
The tiger's roar does not exactly resemble that of a lion, but rather resembles the utterance of roaring, screaming words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and find prey by their sense of smell, by sniffing about where they've been on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move very quietly, and they hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and rushing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it passes through a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations from before to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, the two populations will be so different that they can't be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and take in carbon dioxide, which humans expel (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants, and we make our clothes out of them. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosaic was the supreme predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosaics.
His long jaws were sewn with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the top of his mouth, meaning there was no salvation for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water; it couldn't compete with even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had some rather strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called sunflowers
The other difference was that while the poor men and women ate, sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to make banquets together, lying on their sides while they ate.
It is not possible that ancient Roman dishes included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a grand temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which was open only to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid towers called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family happens outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the shops were just shelves with a view of the street.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited, and in the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and travelling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it his name.
But despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there by this time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland differed greatly.
You might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you've seen the movie "National Treasure".
It's not a treasure map, although there's something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, the text appearing at the bottom of the document upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the beginning, after it was created, the large parchment (29 3‚ÅÑ4 inches by 24 1‚ÅÑ2 inches) was rolled up on a scroll for preservation.
It's most likely that the notation was just added as a label.
With the D-Day landings and the ensuing battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not.
It's run by the French of Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies entered southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
Within just two weeks, American and French forces liberated southern France and headed for Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large and significant group of people working and living together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means "civil", and is related to the Latin words "civis" or "citizen" and "civitas", which is also "city" or "city-state", and that in some way determines the size of society.
The city-states were the forerunners of nations. Culture in the context of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and natural diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, with Congress as the sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since it had no national judicial or executive power, it relied on government agencies, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
Nor does it have the power to veto tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The clauses required the unanimous consent of all states to be amended, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has as a geographical concept, it is often referred to as archipel
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes in local grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty troops (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, the Intihwana, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the boundaries of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they came to be.
By 1976 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues today.
The most common still format in the world, for example, is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its image format is inherited from the sensor image formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the sides of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer denominator) is therefore 3:2.
Equal to or very close to this ratio are very common formats (e.g. APS group formats).
The much-abused and often-mocked rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most appropriate place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines separating the third-party photograph vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had already become rich and powerful, was under criticism.
The Christian religion has united European nations for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
A basic Christian principle is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty and that the church's money funds exist for that very reason.
The central power of the church has continued in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been observed.
Britain began a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
Although this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain mines international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted war effort with submarines.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
Nations wanted to avoid a war situation again in the future, having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I.
To accept a job with Edison in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poetry and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different time periods; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
Between each of the two dynasties, there was also a period of unstable provincial division, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, and in the struggle to sit at the top of the grand palace of Xi'an, thousands of people died.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, classes were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the division in the army being class-based, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other repressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life, and to meditate, he often visited the cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, conveys a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists, once you're inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists.
Erected by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the late Pharaoh.
In the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, on the Giza Plateau, or "Gizza Necropolis", there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are in honor of his wives and family members.
The upside-down sign looks like a V, and the downside-down sign looks like a telobod or a bottomless square.
Up means you have to start at the top and press the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and then pull it out.
The up-pointed bow usually makes a softer sound, and the down-pointed bow is stronger and more confident.
Feel free to put up your own signs, but remember that the printed bowstrings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women in the marketplace.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, one of the crowd waved to the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The Filipinos themselves paid the military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The colonial regime of the United States forced them to pay taxes to cover much of the expense and interest on the bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banks.
The surplus profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of Templarism, one must understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The period in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The actual Middle Ages were preceded by the Early and followed by the Late, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by logic, related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two common ideas are shared between most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself goes on a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, or technology itself affects inherent rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network will not be economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership has also led to higher rates of road accidents, which has necessitated the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a large element of cultural determinism, originated by writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged associated with that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury dates from around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
Its status declined in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and silk, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At this time the title of "Capital of Fashion" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of the slow communication, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was starting to develop its own style, and as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to tie their clothes, which was one of the great developments of the time.
Agriculture for subsistence is agriculture which is carried out to produce sufficient food for the sole needs of the farmer and his family.
Market farming is a simple, often organic system, often using preserved seeds from the same ecological area, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by societal standards. They allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical nature or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used tools to illustrate the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, mistreatment or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during the child's growing years.
Some untamed children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the rejection of severe intellectual or physical disability of the child by the parents.
Wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by animals, the wild child demonstrates behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the particular caregiver animal, as well as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scale building is not a training method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals going through a new learning process, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scales can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scales, and so is the little guy with the clamps in Microsoft Office.
The software has built-in virtual skeletons that are designed to ask questions, remind and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, caring and educational, but it is happening.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving people to care for, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care is supposed to provide everything necessary that was missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the use of the satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'lasting relationships' were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Imay and McCord (1998), when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
It is claimed, in particular, that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his work "The President's Speech", Oliver Sachs points out how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able to perceive a sincere attitude.
He even suggested that similar abilities to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination blur the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it's difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to satisfy their amino acid needs through available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to access would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of legumes, but they are difficult for us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it shouldn't be surprising if our own ancestors solved their protein problem the same way the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep time and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning the clock off in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive the life force, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and our own tension and negativity are the only things that stand in the way of that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is extended by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana way of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the energy of kundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations and mantras.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga, and by visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the mind is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were already enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years, and a real battle was fought through mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan, and many other places.
By September 17th, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian platform and reassess their organization.
These plans, however, were invalidated almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after taking over eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way to transport huge numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy is trying to stop this traffic, mostly with the help of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain, like the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually reared in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goats, who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to reach greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the more uneven roads of the time.
Travers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails would be more effective with a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known way to move was by walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sakhalanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally consciously, join an environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce some of the negative impacts in the future.
In many cases, it's just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4th and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the manuscript was sent to John Dunlap's printing press, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read out publicly by John Nix in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops on July 9 in New York.
The 25 one-sided Dunlap copies of large sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Because they have feathers and they can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But there's a lot about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and scales, they walk on their hind legs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex and lay eggs.
Almost all computers in use today operate on the basis of manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal intoxication doesn't always manifest itself immediately, and symptoms like vomiting are too common to diagnose immediately.
The presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term bug is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from a long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both flying bugs and common bugs are colorless, living in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among youths and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple may be the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most of the scientific research.
It's not just experimentation, although experiments are also used to eliminate some of the possible hypotheses, and asking questions and using guides also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perform a free-moving cycle even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material was the experiment performed by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the DNA of phage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a wide range of effects.
Only mutations in cells from the germline can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive for people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
Activities that can be carried out here include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, to get to their workplace, people travel from small rural towns by car, and they pass others whose work destination is the place the first ones have just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is to some extent connected to and maintains a transportation system through private cars.
That this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years is now being shown by science.
Every person is part of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day, are transportation engineers just incompetent, or is something more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Since driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty, studying traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus traffic flows have some logical sequence and can be represented approximately mathematically.
For a better representation of the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics are defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links help in the planning, design and, finally, operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly has helped them to avoid their enemies more easily and to find food and to breed more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back over their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and unicorns are the only insects that cannot fold their wings today.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people think he's right, but many are of the opposite opinion - that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying over eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide in places.
The Amazon provides as much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The Amazon River is the largest river in the world, and thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the stone pyramid craze continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained unsurpassed in size and technical superiority of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has a population of about 800 people, making it the least populous state and the smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.
All the Vatican's subjects are Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, since they can all be found in nature in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to shape what we see.
Alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Metals are elements like calcium and potassium, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter, which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
So when it first came out, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods came along, the pencil was reduced to a lower status and use.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens and don't have to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The nuclear-plutonium bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill, then splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which is why they tend to break down with a little push or no push.
The lunar surface is made up of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick from the near side and 100 kilometers from the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There might be more sea on the near side, because the crust is thinner there, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness are focused on finding what makes people respond or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation are the two popular theories of content.
Generally speaking, once managers start managing their former colleagues, two behaviors are possible to emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to stay "I'm one of our boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty in implementing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating the activity, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
You become, at the other end of the spectrum, an unrecognizable individual who feels that you have to change everything that the team has done and make it your own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
This behavior often leads to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as normal teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "Invisible Team" is the management team to which each member reports, and sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can manifest themselves.
As a result, the organisation's workflow to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovation process in service of the client's needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organisational training and knowledge sharing.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher results.
The physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognition is provided by neurobiological data, which narrows the field of study and makes it much more accurate.
The link between pathology and brain behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies has allowed us to see and study brain structures and processes that had never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is of great importance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science dealing with learning, behavior and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines that can perform tasks that require intelligent behavior automatically.
Some examples are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These problems have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system, which is embedded in several home computer and video game software applications, is already commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs.
Excursions are a big part of schooling, and very often the teacher would want to take his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a web page about their trip to the state capital, and every year, that web page is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketchbook.
While students often start their blog experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes this fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog, in order to avoid criticism, has started to seek to improve his writing.
Also, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture the interest of the public inspires students to be interesting and smart (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs  it can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to Internet materials in the context of other people's writings students can define their positions and also outline their own points of view on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, home to a number of art galleries and museums that will take you through Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of Muscocca and the surrounding lands.
All of these things establish Ontario as a model of what is typically Canadian for foreigners.
The large areas to the north are rather sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabitable deserts.
One population comparison that surprised many: the number of African-Americans in the United States is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and is a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it had a great influence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route of the Cape of Good Hope, the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling should declare that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to realize that cultural differences can create situations that they consider to be harassment, where they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Beyda, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established their trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, like bagels, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of snacks, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyaragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets and especially the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyaragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle-taxi) to get around Goma.
Timbuktu, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has gained use as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it has become a tourist attraction because of its reputation and its airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1990 because of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS show by Henry Louis Gates, "The Special Wonders of the African World".
The city is markedly different from other cities in the country because it has a more Arab than African look.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe, and the Crocodile River is its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres, divided into 14 separate ecozones, each with a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Normally all South African national parks require a daily fee for park entrance and conservation.
It may also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which gives access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists find worth visiting.
The series of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong resemble a glittering column diagram that stands out because of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely spread over reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 kilometres (50 mi) off the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This part of the forest, which is located in Indian territory, is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, with almost one third of this area covered by water and swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer now live in the area.
Buses depart all day from the Inter-District Bus Station (beyond the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumtang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of travelling short distances, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapoque River to connect the cities of Oyapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapoque in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 meters, 378 meters long, with two sails of 3.50 meters each.
The vertical span under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be put into operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous tribe in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who have survived by hunting, gathering fruit and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with the local groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to retain much of its unique character and identity since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and individual polo players in the world.
The biggest annual tournament is held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
Check out the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo for news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Lira (FKP) with a value equal to one British pound sterling (GBP).
The money can only be exchanged at a bank in Stanley against the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and US dollars are also often accepted within the Stanley credit cards.
In the outermost islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and American currencies may be used; talk to the hosts in advance to find out which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there, winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; normal temperatures in the summer months are above +30 ¬∞C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer would indicate.
There are no special rainy or dry seasons: throughout the year, the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals still remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, bears and wolves should be kept at least 100 yards per meter, and all other wildlife at 25 yards per meter!
No matter how docile they may seem, buffaloes, deer, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so don't go into their personal space.
In addition, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking flavored food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of almost 40,000.
Apia, which has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1850s.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a scandalous naval encounter when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Maoist independence struggle, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of the Tupu√° leader, Tamasese Leal√≥fi III.
Because Oakland crosses two ports, there are many beaches, the most popular in three areas.
North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all are protected sandy beaches for swimming and most have shade under the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are near the Whitewater harbor, on the outskirts of the expensive Mission Bay and St. Helens areas of Central Oakland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One". It's not a heavy beer, but it's nice and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There's a lot of French wines to sample, but New Zealand and Australia might go better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're scared.
The idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. The short black is "espresso", the cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets the Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many of the hikes to the reef are year-round, and accidents to the reef caused by any of these reasons are rare.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cubic jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the city, and can sometimes be found outside this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the passenger the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you may find other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast included, airport transport or even combined air and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a vast majority of participants decide to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you'll have to get there early to get a campground close to the music.
Remember, even though the music for the main stages may be over, there may be festival scenes that will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping spots for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as for the most affected, crossing the ice causes quite a noise.
Cruise to St. Petersburg includes time in the city.
Usually, casinos make a lot of effort to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
To keep guests in a good mood and to keep them in the room, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment offers.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who drives at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or minus temperatures.
The ice and snow are not as friction-resistant as the road.
During thunderstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blizzard, and by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, freezing and snowfall are normal in many countries, and traffic is almost continuous year-round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and is the ultimate destination for many visitors.
The term "safaris" in popular usage refers to a journey over land to see the amazing African wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars and get a good view with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are best observed with binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "desert walk", "tourist safari", or "walking") is a walk that lasts for several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, since the 1964 Games.
If you've booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement of the season is announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with the regular ones costing about ¬•7,000.
Many hotels have a bar and an ironing board that will take care of the problem even if there are no ironing boards in the room.
If you don't have a skirt or don't want to wear a pair of socks, you can try using a dryer, if there is one.
Do not allow the tissue to become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
Water can be purified in a variety of ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have varying efficiency, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unknown to them in their native habitat.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals per se that can injure or kill humans by force are not generally classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers travelling to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated extreme areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are the norm.
The declared speed limits are significantly lower than in previous or subsequent sections, where they are usually 35  40 mph (56  64 km/h) and strict compliance with them is more important than elsewhere.
Curiously, though, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and Bavarian pastries are quite rich and varied, similar to those prepared in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples being added to cakes year-round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other wood nuts.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the ones that, depending on the region, are called berliner, pankuhen or krapfen.
Curry is a dish of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, curry may be either dry or moist.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella covering a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
But when used without further definitions, the term usually refers to dishes originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Today, the cuisine of Java is widespread throughout the archipelago, and includes many simple, spicy dishes, with the predominant flavours favored by Javanese being chili peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of flavored spices.
The beams are suspended on both sides of the saddle for the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
In the event that a rider is thrown by a horse and his leg becomes caught in the groove, he will be pulled if the horse escapes.
First, most riders wear electric riding boots with smooth, narrow soles.
Then, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow the saddle's skin to fall off if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley, Chile's top climbing destination, is known as South America's Yosemite, with its abundance of large granite walls and canaries.
The trails include breathtaking views from the summits, and climbers from all over the world are constantly building new routes through the walls' endless potential.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending over snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, better known as ski booms, planning entire holidays involving skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first ski club in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called skiing, ski touring or ski tourism.
They are similar but do not usually involve alpine-style ski tours or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Look at the ski route as similar to a tourist one.
