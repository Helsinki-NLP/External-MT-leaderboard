A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the steps of a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says he knew no one who wanted to harm his brother. "He had finally gotten his act together".
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old Frank Galizia of San Francisco, according to the San Francisco Coroner's Office.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he was hired as head chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A representative for Sons & Daughters said that the death was a shock to all of them.
"We are a small, close-knit team, like a family, and we miss you very much", says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and friends".
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank first lived in hostels, but he finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who would want to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and generous.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us", says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the injustices in the world, she was a diamond in the rough, shining every day", he says.
Anyone with information about this case is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Striking junior doctors demand new struggles at work
The representatives of junior doctors in the UK (who are mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission for new labour struggles in the dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC), a trade union representing doctors in Britain, is calling on the whole government to support additional work-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC considers that the problems relating to the agreement have not been resolved by the ministers.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with the BMA in a vote in July.
The vote was taken by 58% of Members who voted against the agreement.
On Thursday evening, Ellen McCourt, chair of the JDC's Junior Medical Committee, tweeted a letter to JDC members saying the government had "persistently remained silent" about the issues that McCourt said led to the rejection of the deal.
The letter reads: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the new agreement proposal entirely and demands that all our concerns be formally renegotiated.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board has today made a formal request to the BMA board asking for permission for gradually expanding labor struggles beginning in early September".
The dispute has led to six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first complete layoffs in the history of Britain's public health system.
The BMA's Chief of Junior Physicians, Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and would apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands for reconciliation and to officially end eight months of war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg Palace, I had the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties shook hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he barely lost his heat even with his own restrained gauge.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin  five times, according to one report.
I didn't keep track myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return to a state of even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally saw his enthusiasm as the opposite.
But the constant coldness of Putin's face showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
The reaction in Moscow at the time of the incident was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara in the strongest terms and accused her of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from an alleged friend.
Regaining real trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media waged a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were behind everything.
The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has vehemently denied the allegations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only arranged so that Putin could get the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
This would give Russia some kind of victory.
The benefits of a hard-line ceasefire are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost ousted from power in a failed coup last month.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic implication of the settlement.
The Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the ban on charter flights, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely sigh with relief when air travel can finally resume.
They're putting their faith in the late-night rush to the Mediterranean.
And just this week, state television predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables would fall as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to resume.
"Tourists go, tomatoes come back", said an article in the business magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it believes the West is reacting with a vengeance to the coup attempt.
Not to mention the old grudge over Turkey's rapidly advancing EU accession negotiations and Putin's lack of involvement, who is eager to exploit the cold snaps and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara for expressing support for elected officials after the coup attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, which has its own deep-seated concerns about the change of power.
Thus, at their summit in a lavish seaside palace, Russia and Turkey were able to convey what one analyst described as an "alignment of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Despite the public's goodwill, the two still have major differences.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It is telling that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told a press conference that they had not discussed the issue at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer a question about the differences between the countries, while Putin emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus among countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a total catastrophe caused by the shooting down of a Russian warplane by NATO member Turkey, it is certainly better that, after months of open hostility, the two heads of state are at least speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of RBS, the bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced to a business-only service, i.e. back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank's global objectives.
The bank was forced to backtrack when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
In the meantime, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It has sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it's been seen as the right thing to do to let more national brands into the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but will not use the abbreviation RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWest, except for the head office and the listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain more weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: 'RBS is becoming an investment brand and therefore the one we have our staff working for, because we are now becoming a much more diverse brand bank.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand as well.
Now our efforts are no longer global but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands".
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
'Now is the right time to move to a multi-brand bank, because the question is essentially how can we make it better for our customers,' says the bank's CEO.
"Three years ago, it would have been very clever to say that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and to introduce brands.
But the way we work and focus on our customers' needs instead of our own has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right".
Frankie Dettori rode the Predilection to victory at Newmarket and topped his 3,000th win.
Dettori is spraying champagne after winning two consecutive Newmarket races, which earned him $3,000.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British Touring Car Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night at his local track.
Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in flat track racing.
He has previously been joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
I'm feeling really bad because my family's here, too.
I'm very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly normal Friday night, 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and humbled".
Dettori receives cheers with Predilection after their victory.
Two jockeys have achieved a milestone in the event, champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, has won 4,493 races.
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that few have.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical prowess is what sets him apart.
He is a fantastic representative of the sport of horse racing, and his enthusiasm and determination have brought fans to the sport for years".
"I told Frank a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races already if he hadn't been racing only on weekends and only in the big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the British Championships has been a winning one for almost 30 years, which has been a great thing to watch.
He's a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he's an incredible jockey".
Frankie Dettori, in his trademark way, exaggerated his achievement by leaping from his horse.
"From flying goal earners to flying nudes, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British thoroughbred horse racing for two decades.
It's been a bumpy ride.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous 1996 Ascot victory in the "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and been banned for doping.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had some initial difficulties getting started, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his doubters and came back at his best.
And he's not going to be out of the race anytime soon. Dettori recently said he wants to race until he's at least 50".
Putin fired the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a trusted member of Putin's inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a statement by the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but did not give reasons for the dismissal.
He was responsible for the repressive actions of the 'Donetsk People's Republic' and 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
The victim, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later he headed the Presidential Protocol Department and the Cabinet Office, according to the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment, saying: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the main task of the administration is to support your work as head of state, which means drafting laws and monitoring how the instructions you give are implemented".
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his own resignation and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are those smiles real?
This move has caused a stir in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close associate of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has a KGB background.
As the head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, both said Ivanov was stepping down at his own request.
Despite the smiles on the cameras, the explanations are hardly convincing, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are you firing me because of some sort of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has reacted with great suspicion to the official claim that a man hailed as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
According to the Kremlin website, Ivanov's words to Putin are: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
I have now been the President's chief of staff for four years and eight months".
He was appointed by the President of the Russian Federation on 1 January 2014.
Before that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
During his time as head of the FSB, which replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Mr. Putin appointed Mr. Ivanov as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
At the time, it was thought that Ivanov might become Russian president after Putin's second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected to a third term.
However, the task went to another member of Putin's inner circle, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, and then he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds  FBI Investigator star Thomas Gibson was fired for beating up a producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent altercation on set in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced the firings in a joint statement.
Gibson, known on the show as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had apologized Thursday before his firing was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I am sorry this has happened", he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the FBI agents in the next season will be released later, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Gibson, 54, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
"I was hoping to see the show through, but it's not possible anymore.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our amazing production team and most importantly, the best fans the show could ever have".
The 12th season of the series will begin in the United States on September 28th.
The mysterious fish wash up on the shore of Banff Gardens
Kevin Bain, a resident of Banff, has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind fish that have washed ashore in the storm.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the coast, posted the images of the sight on Periscope in the hope of finding an answer to the appearance of these five-inch fish.
The Queensferry Overpass is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north span of the Queensferry Overpass to the land bridge, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "crow's nest" that are now nearly complete around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister for Finance, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Overpass.
We are all witnessing a really significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, which has taken over 30,000 concrete and steel pieces to build this section alone.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a delicate operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire deck is now in place and the rest of the deck is being poured into concrete at Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted".
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: "The completion of the first section of the bridge is always a major milestone in all bridge construction.
In this fantastic project, this section represents the pinnacle of the road and water construction industry.
After the last section of the roadbed was installed and connected to the North Tower pillar, we had to close the remaining north (i.e., land) gap.
This was done by pulling the northbound earthen dam 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive operation, but one that required great precision.
Massive, for the earthen bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be towed up at an angle of about 3 percent.
And it required great precision, because the tolerances that the work team had to follow were very small  only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, all went well".
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Centre tells the story of three men miraculously rescued from the sea.
Three men who had been stranded in the water off Anglesey on their fishing boat were miraculously saved.
The Moelfre RNLI Maritime Rescue Station issued an alert at 1.20pm local time on Friday after its crew spotted an accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men tried desperately to swim to safety as their boat continued its uncontrolled course.
"We saw the boat go right by them and we thought the worst", says Vince Jones, who was driving Moelfre's lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them".
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted, clinging to a buoy and without life jackets.
They were all taken on a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says: "It's a miracle that these three men who were in the water are still alive and well.
The boat's engine had an emergency shut-off cord, but for some reason it had detached from the man who was driving the boat during the fall.
They were really lucky on their trip".
Pokémon Go chasing brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go gets people off the couch and moving.
At first, screen time was limited to watching television, then video games and, most recently, smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
This is of course referring to the Pokémon Go franchise, a game application whose characters originated from video games created in the 1990s (which were later made into a comic book series, trading cards and other side products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this one also stopped for a while before the new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries was delayed by the huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as popular as Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In a nutshell, players go out to search for Pokémon on their smartphones, which are tracked by GPS, and when a Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using the screen of the phone) or "captured".
The wildness has taken the younger generation of video game players with it and lifted their butts off the couch.
In the United States, gambling has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Cardiogram app on the Apple Watch, which found that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people who exercise for 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45 percent to 53 percent. Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company doesn't know which users are playing Pokémon Go, it only sees raw activity data.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day have resonated with deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regular exercise reduces the risk of cancer and depression.
Exercise helps to control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a host of other benefits.
And that's the great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to go out and do something they enjoy.
This will help to achieve three basic health benefits: exercise, fresh air, sunshine, and joy.
During the hunt, it's even possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes disgusting revelers.
And yes, someone can walk into the door while playing.
What's the big deal?
The break-in has been made.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit might have tracked your activity before, they didn't give you a reason to get out there like Pokémon Go does.
The fascination with novelty is fading, and use decreases over time.
However, the success of Pokémon will lead to more games that combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity, increasing the exercise of people who go hunting and improving their fitness and health.

Simone Biles won gold in the women's individual all-around competition.
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic jumps.
It's easy to pack.
You're gonna have to use a mouthful of that.
She was brilliant at everything.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast won the world championship in the all-around on Thursday, increasing the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
Her total score of 62.198 was significantly better than that of her team-mate Aly Raisman, who placed in the silver medal Final Five, and Aliya Mustafina, the bronze medalist from Russia.
Simone Biles of the United States performs on the pole for the women's individual all-around competition final on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth American woman to win the all-around title, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, if not the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his final tally came in and his long journey ended at this moment.
This achievement takes the sport to a whole new level, raising him to the same level as other superstars in the sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been a dominant force in his sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, 10 of them gold, earned with such ambitious and precise programming that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest track and field athlete of all time".
In Brazil, there was one final contest, which was between Biel and himself and the burden of over-expectations, not so much between Biel and the rest of the world.
Coming home to Texas Springs with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States hug after winning gold and silver in the women's individual all-around competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles won his first gold medal on Tuesday as a point-over-point for the departure of national team coordinator and now retired Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought of anything ahead of time during his long time on top, that's not entirely true.
Part of his permanent program , which includes his signature series of volts , is set to Latin music that could be heard on the streets outside Rio's Olympic Stadium.
It's not a coincidence.
The adoption of her grandparents as a baby and the discovery of her mother by coach Aimee Boorman have made her a force to be reckoned with.
He hasn't lost a single multi-event since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak will likely continue as long as Biles wants it to.
Despite Mustafina taking a small lead with two laps to go, it was like a stiffening.
The only thing left was the bumper and the permanent, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He returned to the lead after scoring 15,433 points and topped the final score list with 15,933.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final scores  which was a mere formality  and tears began to flow around Biles's sparkling red, white and blue border as a dream she once wrote in her scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small rematch of the competition four years ago, when he first shared third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the repechage.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who the Americans call "Mummy", was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flying kisses to the audience after his permanent show, thus rising from a losing position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As for Bilis, a widely shared tweet from the 19-year-old earlier this week has taken on a whole new meaning:
Police say three people who were listening to music in their car were killed by a serial killer .
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's deadliest mass shooting in a decade as the victims sat talking in their cars and listening to music as they were shot, police said in a statement Thursday.
Authorities say a car parked on the side of the road on June 12 was hit by shots fired at Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The gunman was standing on the passenger side of the car, firing eight rounds from his handgun and then fleeing in another car, the statement said.
Police suspect that the triple homicide was not a robbery because the assailant did not take the handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of the other adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says police are now investigating whether the deaths are related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks, mostly in Latin American areas, in the last four months.
"What these events have in common is that they have happened in residential areas in front of homes", Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to be in possession of several vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers are reluctant to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are connected and that the perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were killed instantly.
A witness told police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
Police also released a statement saying that an empty van was shot at just 30 minutes before the triple murder, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Forensics found shells and recovered bullet fragments from the car seat and the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes to sing, play with toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital small-headedness, caused by a genetic disorder of his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, of which he was unaware while pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was, 'I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not committed to this.
Which is not true at all  of course you are committed to it", he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be institutionalized.
"My initial reaction was that I didn't think that was a practice anymore", says Picciuto.
Edmund walks on a treadmill.
Edmund got up and started to squirm when he was three, and he still can't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
She loves to play with her two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund to a reference he invented, which he means "sing to me".
"We are teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not refer to ordinary sign language only. It includes sign languages invented by Edmund himself.
There are a number of different conditions that can cause microcephaly, from hereditary, as in Edmund's case, to viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
There's a huge variation in symptoms and prognosis.
It is too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with Zika.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
"I kept thinking, 'What's going to happen to us,
What will happen to us?"
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time because I don't think anyone can give it to me".
But Picciuto has hope of giving advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things usually work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you".
Heavy rains and flooding triggered a massive rescue operation in Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency Friday due to heavy rain and widespread flooding, with more rain expected to fall on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are overflowing and spreading over a wide area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, says the agency is receiving requests for flooded vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, Tangipahoa County alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flash flood warning is in effect through Saturday for most of southern Louisiana.
According to the weather service, another 76127 mm of water may come to the area.
A flood warning was issued for southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are forecast to reach record highs.
According to forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along the banks of rivers in the suburbs of Baton Rouge could be flooded.
He also says that flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat because the flooded rivers are slowly draining into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state line, the Tickfaw River had risen higher than ever by 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue efforts continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 400 feet [120 m] from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
She had been warned by her other half-brother, who lived nearby.
"We got up, and water came in with a constant supply", says Hansford.
"It reached my waist".
His wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family have all been injured, and he is the only one who can swim.
Rescue workers had rescued all three in a large military-style truck and taken them to the Gloucester fire station, where they were sheltered on Friday.
Forecaster Krautmann says flooding will spread rapidly as heavy rains continue and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports that a nearby observer in Livingston reported nearly a quarter inch [350 mm] of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil has been heavily dampened since the rains began on Wednesday.
Authorities report that heavy rains and flooding of streets forced residents of Tangipahoa County to evacuate their homes and forced school classes to be canceled in five districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa city council had told WWL, a CBS-affiliated television and radio station, that 200 homes were inundated.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now both have been flooded.
County Superintendent Robby Miller says authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in the floodwaters.
Evacuees have been given safe havens in the towns of Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to recede", he says.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly 20 streets were forced to close because of flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last time we had a major flood was in March", says city councilman Lacy Landrum.
"This flood seems to be similar".
In Mississippi, the rains continued steadily along the Gulf Coast, says Rupert Lacy, chief of the Harrison County emergency department.
Lacy says that on Thursday a handful of flooded houses were reported, but as of Friday there had been no reports.
Keith Townson, the manager of Shopper Value Foods, says he's lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and it keeps raining".
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown , who was shot multiple times , survives a shooting in Philadelphia .
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, the second 6-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia that the boy is Mahaj Brown.
According to his grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to the buttocks, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when taken to the hospital.
"He was hit a lot, his little body was full of bullets", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television station.
"I can't believe this is real".
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the network that they think the boy will survive.
He was about to start first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Two 29-year-old men and a 32-year-old man were also shot.
The condition of the other 29-year-old was reported as critical and two others were in stable condition, reports CBS Philadelphia.
According to the network, the child was found in the front seat of a car with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was filled with assault-type shells from various assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shells in the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been several armed fighters on the scene and they have been actively involved in the shooting", Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many homes and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and we've been told that police are reviewing surveillance footage.
The second shooting victim in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl who was hit in the hand by a stray bullet while playing outside her home in West Oak Lane on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I call the Olympic women's gymnastics team, and there's more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as dominant as it is now.
Second, the three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many girls of color.
The team's lineup, complete with Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also reinforced the visibility of black and Latino women at the top of the sport.
For the last four years, the number one female gymnast in the world has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and two.
This is so awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas emerged as the surprise winner of the games, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible feats of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez and their surprising and championship track and field programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
Team mate Aly Raisman won silver.
The view is like this at the peak of the sport, but it's not the same at the nationwide gymnastics sessions.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed in the footsteps of Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the final five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that outdoor gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts mainly train in private gymnastics clubs run by their parents, who pay for training costs, accommodation, travel, accommodation, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
Most gyms are located in affluent residential areas that can support the activity.
Training of gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez' coach Maggie Haney have both been coaching amateurs since they started boxing.
We must provide more affordable and accessible gymnastics training for the countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organizations have provided free or reduced-price outdoor gymnastics training to more than 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latino), some of whom have gone on to national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to our home city of Detroit to provide high-quality outdoor gymnastics training for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Bodybuilding develops strength, agility, and coordination, and it teaches hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has inspired thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnastics, and it's absolutely amazing.
Participating in sports is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for the true "girl power" you showed by winning Olympic gold and for motivating so many young girls from diverse backgrounds to begin their paths as healthy, strong, successful young women.
The junior doctors have rejected Jeremy Hunt 's proposal and are preparing for another strike .
Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over changes to pay and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), the trade union representing doctors, but 58% of the 37,000 junior doctors or specialists who voted rejected the proposal.
Health Secretary Hunt announced plans in July to force the deal, saying the UK's public healthcare system (NHS) was "no one's country" and that any further delays would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will be transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve healthcare during times of social unrest.
The chairman of the BMA's Junior Physicians Committee, Ellen McCourt, issued a statement last night saying: "The junior physicians remain very wary of the proposed agreement, with particular concern that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and not treat all doctors fairly.
There are only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred under the new agreement, so we must move on now, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute through talks, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even unresponsive to talks.
I did this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, reverse the implementation of the agreement and address the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors are ready for new measures of occupational struggle".
The previous strike at the end of April delayed almost 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were called in to support the striking doctors on guard duty.
Ministers hoped to settle the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be affected by the deal.
The NHS's chief of staff, Daniel Mortimer, appealed to junior doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer says: "Work-struggle measures achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on already fringe teams and services and cause anxiety, distress and disruption for patients, healthcare workers and their families.
We have been in discussions with the junior medical committee for the last two months and together with the Ministry of Health and others we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the exposure of irregularities.
Employees were hopeful that continued positive commitment to other important issues  such as development, flexibility in training, further training for returnees, training costs, mutual recognition of curriculum, tuition fees and gender pay gap in the healthcare sector  was a sign of how seriously the employees, Health Education England and the Department of Health intend to stick to the agreements they made with the BMA in November, February and May.'
A drug that costs about $2.40 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are now receiving the drug, which costs about $1.50 a day, when authorities recommended it be given to more people and for longer periods of time.
The anticoagulant tigergelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
It is currently given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a unit of the UK National Health Service (NHS) that assesses the introduction of new treatments, has recommended that patients should be given tigergelor for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a part of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) that is evaluating the introduction of new treatments, has recommended that tigergelor be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them have a relapse or stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fat buildup in the walls of blood vessels that creates plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot to block blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack.
And if the clot breaks, it can travel through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a second heart attack is higher in people who have had a single heart attack.
A tiger gel made by AstraZeneca in the UK, marketed under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of clots.
A draft NICE guidance published today recommends that the initial dose of tigagrelor be 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose should be reduced to 60 mg and aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), says: "Despite effective treatments that effectively prevent disease progression and symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack have another attack or stroke  often with fatal consequences.
Fear of being reborn can have a very negative effect on a person's quality of life.
We have shown that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of tigergelor will provide treatment options for thousands of people who will benefit from it.'
Since the efficacy and safety of tigagrelor  particularly with regard to the risk of haemorrhage  is limited when used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of the treatment method for longer periods.
Due to the political correctness atmosphere, voter fraud in Muslim areas flourished
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was sacked last year for corruption, prompting the government to issue a report
The political correctness climate has led to a general turn of the eye on widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, a government report released today reveals.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles harshly criticized police, election observers and city councils for turning a blind eye to electoral fraud "because of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Pickles, a former minister of local government and now a prominent anti-corruption figure, said that the religious intimidation of voters was so bad that police should have been allowed to set up security chains outside polling stations to protect the intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At this time, all a voter needs to do is provide their name and address.
The report also proposes that after voting, one should dip one's fingers in the unused ink so that no one can vote twice.
Sir Eric says whistleblowers should be given more protection.
He called for improved access for journalists to Cabinet documents and decisions of informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that encourages them more broadly in local government", he says.
The British Prime Minister has requested a report from the East London office following the Tower Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered the removal of then Mayor Lutfur Rahman for corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "seriously distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to "base his campaign on the religious obligation of every Muslim believer to vote for him".
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulent, with the voter impersonating someone else.
Sir Eric said evidence of fraud was found all over the country.
He was particularly concerned about postal fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community were alleged to have pressured people to vote for their candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring identification at the polling station.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and youth, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the wishes of older members, particularly in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin".
"There was concern that . . . the state institutions had turned a blind eye to such activity because of the 'politically correct' oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballots to prevent "vote harvesting".
The report by Theresa May, which is currently under review, also calls for stricter checks on registration to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present identity documents before voting.
Soaking your fingers in unused ink after you vote so no one can vote twice.
systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
The Commission will also be able to take part in the discussions on the draft directive.
Prohibition of political activists from processing filled-in postal ballots and postal envelopes.
The right of police to form chains of guard around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier to bring intimidation charges under the 1983 Representation of the People Act, which extended voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only English allowed at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff supervisory rule of one person at a time is respected.
Sir Eric is a harsh critic of the London police and says it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The electoral court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for corruption and numerous illegal practices", he says.
"He was found guilty without a reasonable doubt, "and the criminal threshold was exceeded on many counts".
He also criticised the ineffective 'load checks' in the electoral list departments of the city council.
"Last year's decision in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call", says Sir Eric.
'Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud and its suppression by some parties.'
The Olympic cyclist 's resemblance to the Duchess Catherine and the other twins at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have been going wild this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is staggering.
But according to discussions on social media, the 24-year-old Olympic delegate is far from the only champion athlete who bears a resemblance to a famous person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the familiar faces flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of all the Olympic delegates who bear a striking resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the United States men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the Duchess Catherine's double on the bike paths, many people have noted on social media that an archer could be the twin brother of actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison of the United States men's archery team caused a storm on Twitter after pictures of him were posted that made him look shockingly like the star of the movie Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media hype and admitted that he'd heard since he was a child that he reminded him of DiCaprio.
"I personally don't see the resemblance as much, except maybe the beard and the mustache", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take that as a compliment".
At the 2012 London Games, British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were scorned for their similarities, which will no doubt be brought out even more in these competitions.
The big-eyed Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been described as a double with Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the swimming trails, for years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison of Glee.
This user says Nathan Adrian is "the athletic version" of the actor from the movie Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, highlighted by their strong eyebrows and lips, has long been noted.
The silver medalist in swimming, Yulia Efimova of Russia, is reminiscent of actress Annalynne McCord, not just because of her beautiful tanned skin and blond hair, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team is described by fans as "the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levit".
These two women of iron, soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their facial shapes and eyes.
Not only that, this Twitter user was happy that others saw the similarity.
This user is wondering if there's a good reason for the resemblance.
One tweeter recently expressed joy that "there is a consensus on the Internet that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter look alike".
The football star and the Dexter actor are truly strikingly similar in their facial shapes and eyes.
Many have also noted similarities between the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the broad smiles of gold medalist gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna Returns star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for calling Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay stunned viewers of the CBC live Olympic coverage on Wednesday.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) has had to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost his stink" and "died like a pig" during a race.
News anchor Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to shout his opinion at the end of the women's 4 x 200 meter freestyle final.
MacDonald, who was brought on the CBC news team to bring in color, was heard to say: "This little 14-year-old Chinese chick is your egg, baby.
He was too excited, he ran out of the car and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that".
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg in 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds behind Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to catch up.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly, shocked by the commentator's tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese mother died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air".
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, who swam in the final of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay, was described as saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese chick is a dick, baby.
Twitter quickly filled with angry comments critical of Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his resignation.
Twitter users were not holding back when they heard how careless Byron Macdonald was.
The tweeted Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like racist people. #disgusting".
CBC host Scott Russell was quick to apologize for MacDonald's remarks: "We apologize for the comment about the swim performance.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we regret that this happened".
The CBC eventually had to apologize over 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
And it took fellow commentator Scott Russell to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
The CBC then copied and pasted its apology to over 90 other tweets complaining about MacDonald's remarks.
The TV company also quickly issued a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and their being broadcast.
We made a quick apology to our viewers on last night's show, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the record, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not about him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is deeply sorry for his words".
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to defend his remarks by saying that he didn't mean it personally.
"I want to apologize for my comment last night after the women's broadcast", MacDonald said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
Needless to say, I meant no offense, and I am very sorry".
In Primark , a woman who was uninhibited in her underwear in the middle of a store shocked customers .
Customers didn't know where to look when she undressed in the middle of Primark to fit her underwear.
To make matters worse, she evaluated her appearance in her underwear, took it off, and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to tour and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at a boutique in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark store in Folkestone Bouverie Place, where a woman tried on her underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the same time, relates that after trying on the underwear, the unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He relates what happened: "The people could not believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own sweater and underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do so in a disguised way.
Everyone was watching as she took off her underwear, which she had been trying on, and apparently did not like it because she put it back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding that he didn't like any of it, got dressed, and walked out.
She didn't seem to care about the looks  or the person who would eventually buy the underwear she had tried".
Davidson, 33, from Kent Town, adds: "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that someone else has worn and not washed".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the store staff tried to remove the items from sale after she left  which is correct.
It would be terrible to take your new underwear home and find that someone else tried it on without washing it", adds Davidson.
A Primark spokesman commented: "Primark is aware of the situation that occurred at its Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.
All products in question have been withdrawn.'
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga .
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, a New York City-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, and asked for advice on how to deal with a gun-wielding robber or assailant at close range.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker is approaching from the front or from behind.
If an attacker is approaching from behind, the first thing to do is turn around to see the attacker and get out of the line of fire, says Mizrachi.
Then, grab the weapon so that it is between your elbow and shoulder girth and hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker in the groin with your knee, and when he goes from pain to pain twice as much, slap him in the face with the barrel of the gun and retreat with the gun pointed at him.
The technique is similar if an armed attacker is approaching from the front, you have to move away from the line of fire, grab the weapon, and then turn it around so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, put your weight on the weapon and punch the attacker in the chest, turn the weapon away from the attacker's grip, back away and keep the weapon pointed at the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video of Mizrachi doing it.
But remember, the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Ian Wright , world traveler and tour guide , licks the dirtiest places in Europe .
A British world traveler put his resilience and gag reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a Suffolk presenter and travel guide author, wanted to prove his resilience by licking a euro banknote, a handmade Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a Russian pay phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and to show the audience what he was sticking his tongue into.
The experiment was made into a documentary film, Ian Wright  The Power Within, and the results were surprising.
The thought of licking the flush button in a train toilet may seem repulsive, but the reality is that there are more germs in the kitchen sink.
While traveling around Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening the good bacteria in the gut and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing she licked caused anything but a bad taste in her mouth.
Ian Wright first became famous for his travel program, where he tested his gut's resilience by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt, licking the handmade railroad stationery and the toilet flush button challenged Wright's resilience.
Wright says in the documentary: "I have been quite careless about my health since I was a child, putting everything in my mouth, including dirt, worms and sewage".
In the movie, he really proved himself worthy of his reputation.
The only way to cross the border was in a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured over 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, freshly washed hands usually have less than 60.
The border came in a Russian public restroom, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units.
Wright is co-producing the documentary Ian Wright  The Inner Power, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
It's so disgusting, I'm not really licking anything in here".
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright  The Inner Power Trail in collaboration with Valio.
Wright was given Valio Gefilus, a herb containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut's good bacteria and immunity.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the Valio snack, juice and fresh products category, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that's fascinating to watch and at the same time tells you about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we came up with the idea of asking Ian to come along".
Gastrointestinal health has become a global trend.
"We wanted to talk about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to immunity.
Intestinal health has become a global trend and this document will help us to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, the film's director, adds: "Let's just say I would have lost respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is also shown in the film.
Of course, some of the objects were easier for Ian to lick, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licking on tape".
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with gut health and 58% reported at least occasional use of products containing lactic acid bacteria.
The troublemaker family destroyed a townhouse in Saltash, Cornwall, before they were evicted.
The troublemaker family left £50,000 in damages to a townhouse they owned after they were evicted because of the terrorism in the neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple were forcibly removed from their apartment, the representatives of the rental company were shocked to find that the apartment was in a state of disrepair.
The walls were drilled with holes, the floorboards torn apart, the trash spread on the floors, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The couple have now moved out and are believed to be living in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears the house may no longer be salvageable.
He says: "It has been a nightmare for the people who live here, and no one should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to consider, as the property is likely to become known as a not-so-pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is as infamous as its name".
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment on and off, and police said the family's violence included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of neighbors, drug use and delivery, and loud shouting, fighting, and swearing.
A 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed a lease, was issued an injunction for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house under the demolition, old debris was found.
The house had been used to sell drugs and the floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting in the street and that police were regularly called to the scene.
The Cornish Housing Authority evicted the couple this week after giving them 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction  they said their life had been hell on earth.
Says one neighbor: "They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been hard.
The police have been here an incredible number of times".
"We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It'll be wonderful now that they've finally been evicted".
Adam Fitzpatrick, the director of enforcement for the Cornwall Housing Authority, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were called in regularly.
Trash and old toys were thrown against the wild wall of the tenement house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is unfortunate that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last resort considered by the Cornish Housing Authority.
This case was very difficult, because the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my task force, the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community who took part in the work and courageously volunteered to give us information.
I hope this step forward will improve the wellbeing of neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour is not acceptable.'
Fitzpatrick says that the family's three sons had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already in their 20's.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms of the house after the eviction .
Housing workers now have to clean up the garbage around the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies, and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possession of a class B drug with intent to sell.
He claimed the money was for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband are said to have moved into a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were covered with graffiti.
Police say they're gonna have to evict tenants who break the lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police says this eviction will serve as a clear warning to tenants who continually defy the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can do whatever they want without being charged, as well as to those who suffer from this behavior", says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying military jet that crashed onto a beach scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced a shock in their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion crashed at a staggeringly low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and that there was no safety risk.
The image shows the moment when the tourists panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a crowded beach.
Dramatic images show a military plane coming within close range of sunbathing tourists on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Understandably, holidaymakers were upset by the jet engine noise that began to sound before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who posted pictures and videos of the dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice at a very low altitude, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash".
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane was going to fall on me".
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a startlingly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which caused the plane to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke from the nearby forest fires was interfering with visibility, but the Air Force said that this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight during which the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
The first half of the year is better than expected
The South Karelian Social and Health District (Eksote) exceeded its target of EUR 3.4 million in January - June.
Expote's profit was EUR 4,3 million in the first half of the year.
The results were particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has helped to break down institutional care.
The guarantee of care was implemented in all operations.
This year, the Exote will try to cut the lines.
The ex-ante surplus covers the deficit that was previously created.
The remainder may be used to reduce queues and purchase procedures for patients.
The full year's result is expected to be EUR 4,6 million better than planned.
The ECOFIN Council will consider the half-yearly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards took the oath of military service in Imola
Seventy enlisted men from the Coast Guard and Coast Guard Academy took the oath of service on Friday.
The military ceremony for the Border and Coast Guard School of Cadets was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Patrol Whaling School was held at the Garrison Sports Ground.
70 of the soldiers took the oath of allegiance.
Border specialists are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat roles.
They serve 347 days a year.
This year, 310 young people applied for the special border patrol.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border guards have been trained at Immola since 2007.
The ceremony was attended by five wartime veterans of the frontier troops.
The average age of those involved is now 90.
The oldest veterans who have attended the event were born in 1918.
A little bit of a robbery ahead - Crime detection helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has operated an RTA, or Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible to the outside world.
The Hämeen police station has a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinn.
It's being pulled by a sergeant stationed at the Bay.
The head of the unit is the Lieutenant in the Bay.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinn.
They all work in civilian clothes.
The unit has shown its usefulness and its necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the other police.
In the process, it has obtained information on asylum seekers, among other things.
The most recent reform of working practices
The creation of the analysis units is the latest reform of the police's working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, so that the police will rarely go to the scene and call only when they receive an alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will direct daily policing activities where they are most needed.
The reform of the police administration led to the establishment of a single crime-intelligence centre, three national units under it and a separate crime-intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in the Vantaa area under the auspices of the Central Criminal Police, is responsible for national operations.
The PTR units are staffed, as their name suggests, by people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas allocated to police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local and national police forces.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory.
Whereas an individual officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit is aware of what is happening throughout the police station.
Intelligence also extends beyond the confines of one's own agency, as does crime.
The people who work in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the regular police.
The unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive or similar crimes by means of registers, alert database and observations.
This is called ranking, and it's one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
Every person has their own way of doing things.
You can see the fingerprint on the job, whether it's honest or criminal.
The way it's done, it creates a certain image of the perpetrator.
Sorting can be done either by the method of crime or by the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA employees don't walk around town with their collars up, but their work isn't exactly public.
The methods used by both the criminals and themselves are not disclosed, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to hinder police efforts to combat crime.
The police shall make public the methods used if they foresee that they will pose a threat.
One such case was the one reported in the early summer of the use of the "empty sign" in home burglaries.
In it, the perpetrators placed a stick, a button-point, or a piece of tape on the apartment's front door to test whether the residents were really traveling.
The investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties.
The analysis unit has found that even the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest of them will order a court report, which may reveal, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go after the thieves with gloves on.
For the case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppäs Hämeen from the police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepolaa from the Eastern Finland Police, Crime Commissioner Sami Joutjärveä from the Joensuu Police Station and Crime Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Crime Police were interviewed.
The police collect and analyse information to help them plan their actions.
The background is a decline in the labour force and in funding.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage reform of the PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation is aimed at collecting information from outside the institution and the Finnish borders.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria .
The news reports that one in three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee says the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the Islamic State's base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"Hopefully, this will serve as a warning example and testament to people's understanding of the real risk of going to a war zone - and that will make people give up on leaving", Akunjee says.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a flight to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court if she is elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
The Republican Senate has refused to confirm Garland's nomination since Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a telephone interview Thursday that he predicted Clinton would elect Garland "with a fairly high degree of certainty".
Reid's spokesman later clarified that this was all speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether he would name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" by picking someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid says the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "partisans" and "promoters" of presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He says Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine , nude calendars are as much for women as they are for men .
Treats is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to launch a calendar inspired by Pirelli and set in the style of the 1970s for 2017.
Instead of celebrity models, they want to find next-generation top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his strip differs from the old-school Playboy magazines in that, according to him, "Playboy is for men.
I do this for women".
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We need to bring back the timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, can feel free to enjoy and be inspired by these images that glorify the female body", says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"I'm sure the women will want to be part of this project because it's going to be a beautiful work of art".
Those who want to design a calendar can submit their pictures online or participate in open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
The appeal of vinyl: who buys records?
Single, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write your angry objection in the comments section under the heading Not AllSingle Middle-Aged Men, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the research company YouGov, the much-talked-about new vinyl boom is not a millennial boom, with millennials wanting to feel a physical object in their hands, but a nostalgia for middle age.
The most likely age of a person who recently purchased a vinyl album is between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely to buy.
It is also not just the desire of fans to cuddle up to records, but the significance is emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a television news broadcast, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy Soho Street, wearing a plain gray suit, and I would be buzzing, bending my hand into a cup, and saying something traditional, like, "Let's find out".
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and elegance as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase have taken over formerly private-owned premises, a handful of specialty record shops still remain.
I would probably ask the cameraman to pause the camera for a moment while I take a close look at the men who visit these stores and try to assess their age and character by observation.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from the Sister Ray shop (two young women, three middle-aged men, currently customers) to the Reckless Records shop (eight middle-aged men, one probably a woman in her twenties) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends his extra time checking out the stores.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I think I am", he says.
"I have about 3,000×4,000 records".
These records fill the wall of his living room, as you can see in this picture.
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly because of his disposable income, which now enables him to buy records he could not afford when they first came out and to buy again things he had to sell when he was young and penniless.
"I get a lot of late '60s and early '70s stuff that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get it", he says.
He agrees that vinyl buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my bad".
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
But he has discovered a new kind of crowd, influenced by the media hype, who have heard about the resurgence of vinyl records and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"From my discussions, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back", he says.
This could explain the boom in vinyl stimulants for certain ages.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
It takes seconds to realize that in a movement like Phonika, they provide a comforting community for like-minded guys.
Weiz said that some of the older customers are particularly upset with the contactless payment system.
The digital world may be puzzling to some vinyl fans, for whom a return to familiar record covers means permanence and reminds of the happy days of youth.
"I think sometimes it fills a hole or material possessions are acquired as some kind of consolation", says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I think many others do too.
It's an easy way to distract yourself".
"We're like social workers!" exclaims a colleague of Weiz's from behind the cover.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of those who had bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also revealed that 41 percent own a record player they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl buyers do not own a record player at all.
At this point in the newscast, I'd probably be putting on a serious face while I browse through a staggering collection of bossa nova.
The resurgence of vinyl records is also associated with the "cup phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, a salesman at Sounds of the Universe (who was a customer of three middle-aged men at the time).
"A customer recently came into the store and said he didn't have a record player, but he wanted to buy a Radiohead record so he could put it on his shelf", Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not large, but they are there.
They're more interested in material things than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers just starting out".
The clientele is much more diverse in Fopp, which I'll be going to next, and they've dedicated an entire floor to vinyl.
Customers include couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys, and middle-aged women.
The diversity of the customers is delightful, even if the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous shops: instead of the roaring jazz from the speakers, the sex-filled synth pop of Wild Beasts' latest release.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but the psychological trauma of being in a room with someone for 30 seconds is hard to tell.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various discounted records.
He's more interested in watching than shopping.
He says he's a low income, so it's not possible for him to collect records.
"They're expensive.
Music is easy to listen to on a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of vinyl is ...' he sighs with delight and continues:
"I can't explain it. They're so unique".
My final stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who you would imagine jumping in jeans, but instead they're just kind of crowding around Polaroid cameras for a moment, and I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, the walls of which are filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical, the key records in any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just decorative elements and some are so high that they are not even reachable.
They're all pure art vinyl.
But considering all the ways to get attention for these records could mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there's little to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the population group most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group that spends the most money on luxuries, such as vinyl records.
While my research shows that YouGov's findings are correct, at least for Soho record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be very close to school or work.
They certainly do not spend Thursday mornings browsing Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old pretending TV host who stares at unsuspecting middle-aged men with a scary stare.
The holler, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate  Video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on earth is the ice shark.
According to researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was found to be 272,512 years old, a female six-foot-long [5 m] shark.
The French court dismissed the application for the winding up of the forest colony shops
A French court has rejected a request by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants and to house thousands of refugees in a jungle camp.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be allowed to dismantle 72 temporary shops in the refugee camp, which sell a variety of products to camp residents, from tobacco to energy drinks and haircuts, while temporary restaurants can buy tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for a few euros.
According to the Calais prefectural authorities, these shops and restaurants must be closed because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp because the free meals provided by the state-sponsored organization and others are not enough for the camp's growing population.
They say that convenience stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 shopkeepers but considered the prefect's concerns "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the camp's food stores, cafes and restaurants are of far greater importance than simply providing food to people who "live in extremely precarious conditions".
He says they provide peaceful places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the places under the demolition barrier was the camp's Jungle Book Kids Cafe, a nonprofit that provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum counseling for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp who are the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition demanding that the children's cafe be preserved.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, closing it "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to a record high of more than 9,000.
Food prices in Finland fall significantly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply, much to the delight of consumers and the chagrin of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost 5% in three years, compared with an average decrease of 0.9% in the EU.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has risen in price by 1 percent.
Over the past three years, Finland has seen the second-highest decline in food prices among EU countries with similar wage levels.
Only in the UK, a comparator country, has the price of food fallen faster than in Finland.
The information comes from an article by Ilkka Lehtinen, head of development at the Statistics Centre, published in Tieto & Trendit.
The newspaper compared real prices, i.e. prices which are proportionate to the general trend in consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to 1994 levels.
It was a very alarming situation.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that EU membership brought", says Lehtinen.
Then came the turn, and food has become cheaper year after year.
The price is now being weighed by Russian food import bans that have halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
As a result, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term", says Lehtinen.
The price decline has also been affected by increased price competition in industry and trade.
The big retailers S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been shown in the form of glamorous advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a centre for affordable food, despite a substantial drop in food prices.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to the newspaper, the value added tax has a significant impact on the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the countries in question had the same rate of VAT, Finland would be the third cheapest food market in comparable countries.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the rate of VAT in the countries in question were seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell food cheaper than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we need to halve VAT to the EU average and keep up price competition", Lehtinen writes.
The magazine notes that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
School ain 't what it used to be .
A returnee to school may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools and will be introduced at the beginning of the term in all primary schools.
It is the guideline that all schools in Finland follow.
The schools will decide the details themselves, but the plan states the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been in the works for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
For example, the teaching of fine writing will be abandoned and coding will be taught in schools.
Swedish is taught from the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies from the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is in the role of the students.
It used to be thought that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone must be active and learn from one another.
This is a way of trying to make school more interesting.
The world 's longest-living vertebrate has been found . A glacial shark can live up to 400 years .
The Greenland shark, also known as the ice shark (Somniosus microcephalus), does not reach sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
After that, it can live another 250 years, reports a new study.
The numbers make it the longest-living species of vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is surpassed only by the Icelandic clam, whose oldest known specimen is 507 years old.
The Greenland shark swims across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, growing up to over five meters.
Because of the slow growth rate, only about a centimeter a year, the adults have lived a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon dating of the eyeglasses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 1,493- and 1,502-centimeter-long [493 and 1,502-cm] Amazonian catfish, turned out to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice-capped parrots do not reach sexual maturity until they are over four meters [4.5 inches] long, the researchers estimated that they are about 150 years old.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired almost 300 people. They're not cutting sales.
Nearly 300 employees are being laid off at Stockmann department store.
The cooperative societies in the company in difficulty were terminated at the beginning of August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of some 300 jobs, most of them in the form of redundancies", says Stockmann in a press release.
It states that the number of shopkeepers will not be reduced in order to avoid a loss of customer service.
In addition, some 80 support staff will be offered new sales jobs.
Stockmann's negotiations involved some 3 000 workers.
At the time of their introduction, the reduction was estimated at around 380 employees.
The reduction in population is intended to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme aimed at achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The reason for this is Stockmann's difficulty in making a profit from the goods store.
Although the Group's adjusted operating profit improved to EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, the goods business continues to be loss-making.
According to Stockmann's CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Norwegian authorities on the restructuring plan.
The improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good performance of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second quarter turnover and profit.
The operating profit of Lindex increased by EUR 9,5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group had a loss-making turnover of 4,1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover this year will be lower than last year.
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be the wettest day in the north with temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country.
The center of low pressure over northern Finland predicts rainy weather on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
The central parts of the country will also experience rainy spells, but the south will experience a dry spell.
The temperature is no longer summery, with mercury below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the northern rainy areas, it's gonna be 10 to 15 degrees.
The Kenyan national team is rocked by a doping scandal. Strange explanation for the kidnapping of their coach.
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah had tested positive for doping as a national team athlete.
The Associated Press reports that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform for is 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan national team, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotich in a surprise test.
The doping officials went to the Anzrah authorities to report him.
According to the report, Anzrah was sent home because he "committed a crime against the Kenyan national team".
He was pretending to be an athlete, giving a urine sample, even signing papers.
We cannot accept this kind of behavior", said Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee.
The Olympic athletics meet is on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known if the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at last year's World Championships and is already the favorite to win in Rio.
Reuters reports that a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the competition village.
When the anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being discovered", the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio 's athletic stadium is ruminating on its emptiness .
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to watch a sporting event.
The medal battle for the world's top athletes began in Rio on Friday, but they were able to show off their skills to a bewildering audience.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
The other was four years ago in London, where the stadium was buzzing with cheering crowds.
The final is sold out in Rio.
The spectatorism of the Rio Olympics has been noticed even before the sport of track and field.
For example, in rugby, water polo, and horse racing stadiums, thousands of empty benches have been seen.
When Brazil's medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played Russia, and the 12,000-seat stadium was only about 30 percent full.
The reason for the poor performance is at least that Brazil, which is struggling economically, is far from European and Asian competitors, and many Olympic sports are foreign to Brazilians who are used to soccer.
True, even the first game of the Brazilian national soccer team failed to fill the stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the organizers, said over the weekend that 82 percent of tickets had been sold, a significant decrease from four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell", Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets are under 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this is not yet allowed because the organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats in Rio Stadium this morning.
Even a beach volleyball on the sands of Copacaba has not caught the eye of the public.
The middleweight contestant competed in London 2012.
There were plenty of people at the leaflets.
A new way to protect nature - acquiring land rights
The Helsinki Foundation is contributing to nature conservation through new means.
The foundation, which was established last year, is acquiring ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and entities can redeem land rights with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to pay for the right of ownership.
The owner of the land gets a veto over its 187-square-foot plot, which means that in practice, no approval is needed from every owner if the land is to be converted.
You can also get fairy rights for more than one block.
The acquisition of a right of administration is something tangible that can be passed on as a legacy or given as a gift.
No need to go out and carry banners or chain yourself up to protect nature", explains Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the management rights to his company.
The person who has obtained the right of administration receives precise location information from his block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website provides a fascinating list of the names of the rights holders on the same map as the block data.
The only risk to the conservation project is that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a non-profit foundation established to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation will act in some way that is unethical or commercial, but that should not be possible.
The Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is based on the idea of protecting natural areas so that they can be left intact and peaceful.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of rights of ownership, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims to expand beyond Finland and plans to import from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Trade Fair on 13-19 August.
Bicycle thieves are the worst scourge in the big cities.
Bicycle thieves are the worst scourge of Finland's big cities.
This year, more bicycles have been stolen there than in nine other major cities, for every person in the city.
The Helsinki Report found that the number of bicycle thefts reported to the police in the ten largest cities in Finland in January-August this year was as high as the number of bicycles and bicycle parts stolen per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were placed at the top.
Police reports indicate that there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In contrast, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
"Other cities have twice the number of burglaries per capita", explains Tommi Reen, a police inspector with the Police Department.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bicycles have been stolen in Turku than anywhere else.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of thefts can be affected by how much bicycle traffic there is in the city and how many bicycles there are", says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The number of bicycle thefts varies greatly depending on which cities are study and which are cycling cities.
The market is a tightly-closed place, with short distances and plenty of turns for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a very different kind of city, where the city centres are far apart and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport", says Reen.
The number of bicycle thefts reported by the police in Finland as a whole has slightly decreased in January-August compared with the same period last year.
Still, there's no reason to be too happy.
Despite the decline in recent years, just over 20,000 bicycle thefts are reported to the police each year.
That means 50 to 60 filling stations every day and about 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They are large amounts", says Reen.
In reality, the thieves steal more bicycles, since only a fraction of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bicycle theft, even though fewer than one in ten reported cases to the police are solved.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one where the police get word of the theft immediately and the thief is caught red-handed.
"Cases are also revealed in other investigations, such as when stolen bicycles are found in a drug case", says Reen.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught weekly on the spot or during a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He says that bicycles are stolen from, for example, bike racks in shopping malls, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars - practically anywhere they are usually kept.
Of the individual models, the most frequently stolen are the Jopo, as in previous years.
A U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bicycle for short-term personal use, for example, but a large number of the stolen bicycles end up for sale, for example, online.
They're staying on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been made aware that the stolen bicycles are rarely exported", says Reen.
The police say the buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
I'm sure some of you buy a stolen bike without even knowing it.
Some of you may have doubts.
A buyer of a used bicycle must be careful, for he may be guilty of a concealment offence or violation.
"Alarm bells should ring if a good bike is sold at a significantly under-priced price", says Reen.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsa to the Kallion Library in Helsinki during his workday.
He has had five bikes, but none have been stolen, Hirvi says. "Never been taken, so far as a good monk goes".
"Maybe this is not so attractive to thieves, it may not even be hipster", reflects Hirvi from Helsinki.
At a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, a quick-witted Siiri Valve locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the bike is banging against the kiosk wall, but usually Valve locks the bike to something solid, like a wheel rack.
"It's a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own", says a student in Helsinki about his white bicycle, which cost about $500 for the body alone.
"I hear from my friends all the time that the wheels have been stolen".
"Especially bad wheels, like the Junk Job".
Valve himself had a bike stolen from a real estate company yard a year ago.
But the wheel hadn't been locked, so Valve was looking forward to stealing it.
Under 15s to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with US-based peer jury
In Helsinki, so-called peer jury trials are being conducted to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
The trial will initially be conducted on children under 15 years of age, who will now be free from criminal liability.
A jury of his peers will be brought to the scene of a first offense committed by a juvenile.
The idea is that a jury will discuss what happened with the offender and then decide on a penalty.
A week later, the offender can join a jury of his own to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Tommi Laitio, the youth director, says the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All of them guide the young person's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake", Laitio explains.
The peer review system is modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first offense, a youth is not put in front of an adult panel but reflects on what happened with others of roughly the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu, who monitored the trial, says that the abuse was successfully dealt with.
Especially for those under 15 years of age, first offences may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to keep going on the path you've chosen", Lovio says.
The peer review body is part of the Helsinki project of the Immigrant Youth, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me-Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of working are being offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, which had obtained a draft of it for viewing.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signers want party funds diverted to the congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the dissent caused by Donald Trump, his carelessness, incompetence and record unpopularity, threaten to bring a swing to the Democrats in this election", the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all available resources immediately to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump-decorated anchor around their neck.
The letter says the decision shouldn't be difficult because Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are getting smaller by the day.
Politico says the letter is due to be sent out within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is apparently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and is not about endorsing anyone.
The letter lists several acts by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials wrote an open letter saying they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States .
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released details of her economic policies on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so that the American economy will be good for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy will be good for him and his friends", Clinton said in her speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion, five-year program to improve America's infrastructure -- roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases from the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a hand-hold for the American workers who suffer as factories move to low-wage countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a builder nation. We must get back to building!
Clinton said it.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway when he said the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax evader, it has to pay the exit tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
According to speculation in The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program of Republican Donald Trump, announced on Monday, as "favoring only millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed screw-up of the corporate tax cut has been called a "Trump loophole" by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of the small business owners whose bills Trump has not paid and the clothing that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America", Clinton sneered.
The race has not kept Finns on the sidelines, but the mobile app is interesting
Sports teams usually appear in television ratings as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached the amazing spectators.
The competition attracted a maximum of 12 per cent of the population: the swimming was watched by 615,000 viewers on the Olympic Channel in Yerevan on TV2 on Tuesday night.
For comparison, a month ago, the European Championships in athletics attracted almost 800 000 viewers at a time on TV2, while the European Championships in football attracted just over two million.
The most popular events so far have been Sunday night cycling and the opening day of the fifth day of track and field, both of which reached nearly half a million viewers on the Olympic Channel at a time.
The Commissioner for Sport, Panu Pokkinen, welcomed the results and said that the Olympic Games in Rio will be the first time that the audience will be divided into multiple venues.
In addition to television, the Finns are watching the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased that a large proportion of television viewers are choosing the Olympics in general.
On the television side, viewers are divided between TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting event to be dedicated by Yle to an entire channel.
When you're on 24 hours a day, and you're watching from 20,000 to 500,000 people all the time, that's a good base.
Viewership is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts are in Finland at night.
The second reason for the lack of interest - if anyone thinks it is - is probably the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal at the opening games, interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, the sport of outdoor activities is just beginning, as are the other sports that Finns are interested in: sailing and horse riding.
The initial ratings have been close to what was expected, according to Pokkisen.
When the game starts, the ratings are gonna explode.
Yle launched Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the Games, which rose to become the most downloaded free application in Finland in the first days of the Games on Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're about 200,000 loads in the air by now.
"We'll get the numbers later", says Pokkinen.
The Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come in and the bugs have been fixed.
The Rio Arena has been subject to delays and other minor technical problems in the initial phase.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen on the YLE channels and in the arena more than any other sporting event ever before.
Yle Fem can follow some sports, and Yle Spehe broadcasts races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most hardworking YLE ever, but also the last to be watched only on YLE channels.
From 2018, the Olympic Games will be shown on both YLE and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 metres at Kristinselää.
It could be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-meter [20 sq m] pressure vessel at the bottom of the lake, which the dive computer showed to be 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by echo.
The method may not detect a small drop within a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Inari Lake (92 m) and Suvasvesi (90 m).
The Saimaa, Toisvesi and Main Lake are over 80 metres high.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Vertigo.
The bottom of Lake Inari in particular has not been thoroughly mapped.
"There may well be unknown passages", Kannela muses.
If the deepest lake is defined by its average depth, it is the Great Juka Lake, 75 feet [23 m].
In this way, your Sun falls short of the top ten, and the Black Sea is even further from the top.
Correction of 12 August at 14:29: Corrected last paragraph where the deepest lakes were wrong.
IHN: Taxation of pensioners still more tight
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the problem was brought to light during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to that of salaried workers.
The board's motion does not include any such thing.
We think it should definitely be there.
The European Union is committed to a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Middle East.
Earlier this year, workers received a reduction in their earnings, which eased their tax burden.
The issue was heated up by opposition MPs who charged then-Financial Secretary Alexander Stubb (R-UK) with election promises.
Purchasing power is being secured, not increased.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure that the tax rate is maintained.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The Commission is also proposing that the EU should be given a mandate to implement the EU's nuclear programme.
He says that sticking to the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It is a social contract and it must not be marred by question.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own belief in the future.
In the midst of prolonged unemployment
Ihalainen is calling on the government to tackle longterm unemployment in the budgetary gap, at least to stop its growth.
The number of longterm unemployed in June was about 17 000 higher than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will fall.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, a very large social decline is in the offing.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in attacks on Thailand
In Thailand, at least four people were killed in bombings last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists who are going to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
Westphalen said there were very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although it was difficult to estimate their exact numbers.
The Finnish travel season to Thailand is timed to the turn of the year.
Most of the tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in particular in Hua Hin to obtain information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be going well, says Westphalen.
No information on the perpetrator
Westphalen says we still don't know who did the attacks.
The Ambassador believes the events may be related to political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was approved by referendum.
The referendum was not a transparent, democratic process.
Among other things, the country arrested people who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population is raging, says Westphalen.
Muslims want more autonomy.
However, previous attacks have not been directed at tourist destinations.
Westphalen says there's a big local celebration in Bangkok today.
He says the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks affect the course of the day, so the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police: attacks not international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from regular terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, reports the AP news agency.
At least four people have died in Thailand in the last 24 hours as 11 bombs exploded in various parts of the country, including the tourist-favorite cities of Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded overnight on the resort island of Phuket, a popular tourist destination for Finns, reports the Bangkok Post.
The information we have so far indicates that they did not require casualties.
Two of the bombs went off at Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, injuring one person, the newspaper said.
In the popular tourist destination of Hua Hin, a total of four bombs exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
Both twin bombings killed at least one person.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in Surat Thanh village and in the city of Trang.
Both attacks killed at least one person.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many travelers, as it leads to the resort islands of Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan, and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, head of the military junta in Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We must not make people panic any more, he told reporters.
According to the Deputy Minister of Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators' intention was to destroy the country's tourism industry because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns who are going to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Injured Europeans
The attacks that took place during the Finnish night and the victims are still very little known.
We've had time to get a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
The attack killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded near the famous clock tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have sealed off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
The governor of Surat Thanh province said the bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
We have at least one wounded.
The police chief interviewed by CNN said that the attack on Surat Than was also accompanied by two bombs that exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs went off outside two different police stations.
Biles of the United States won the women's quadruple sculls.
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Aliya Mustafina of Russia was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the Rio Olympics, where he will be the world champion in the pole vault, long jump and pole vault.
Biles has been a dominant force in women's gymnastics for the past few years.
He's got eight individual world titles from three seasons ago.
He's won the four-man and the four-man championships three times in a row and the pole position last year and the second year.
The U.S. team at Biles has won two World Team Championships.
You know, there's a lot more World Cup medals in Biles than jumping and bouncing.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: 'The iceberg has no effect on tourism'
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think anything more remarkable will follow, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for some twenty years.
A seasoned entrepreneur, he has seen up close many of the tragedies that have befallen Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year, the bombing in Bangkok.
If these have not driven out tourists before, this one hardly.
The courthouse office is located a few hundred yards from the explosion.
The court heard about the attack from one of its own employees.
The employee called about 9:00 a.m. local time and said that it was a bad idea to come to the office.
The courthouse says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed due to the attacks early in the morning.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were put in place for the queen's birthday, says Huovila, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere in Patong was calm, and shops on Main Street were allowed to open at about 10:00 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
By 3:30 p.m., Thai time, traffic had returned to normal in Patong and most shops had opened.
Judging by the impact site, the explosion was quite small, says Huovila, who was at the scene.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
Patrol spotted two men matching IDs hiding in a nearby bush.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and aggravated battery.
The police are grateful to those who gave us the tip.
The head of the investigation on the change of leadership in Russia: clear displacement
Russia's highest-level leadership change in years took place on Friday when President Vladimir Putin fired his administration's chief, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino, of Estonian origin.
He's an ex-diplomat who served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent the powerful people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that reversing leadership roles is one way to exercise power.
This is a way to prevent people from accumulating power for themselves independent of the president.
According to Kangasbro, it's also possible that Ivanov may have had a run-in with other senior officials or screwed up.
Reduction of rank to Ivanov
Mr Ivanov, a former Putin insider, will be moving to special duties in the environment and transportation departments.
In a video broadcast by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov had asked to be transferred to other posts and suggested Vaino instead, Russia Today reported.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's perspective, this is a clear demotion.
Environment and transport are not very high on the Russian agenda.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has been a key member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old cards, such as governors, have been changed in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the successor to Ivanov is that Putin is changing his inner circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields as they retreated into Syria.
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars that took them to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS, last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected from earlier 7:30 PM news: We previously incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, but in fact ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
The Interior Ministry's document disclosure policy is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's policy of making documents public is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The Votilainen told STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authority's own guidelines, but on the law.
The Ministry of Interior has previously refused to hand over the list of participants of the Minister of Interior's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified his decision on the basis of the instructions of the Cabinet Office and on the grounds that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's communications director tells STT that the Ministry has identified a need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt 's final Olympic appearance begins in Rio .
As in years past, Bolt has been racing against time under the weight of the competition.
He injured his backside in his junior year and had to miss the Jamaican Olympic trials.
This hasn't been perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's key", Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included strippers and fan-turned-reporters.
The porina around Bolt underscores the Jamaican's rise to stardom in an era when the sport has struggled with doping scandals and a declining interest in skating.
Bolt's last Olympic defeat came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the preliminary round of the 200 meters in a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promising youngster slowed by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began with the 100 meters, where he broke the world record and the confidence of the competitors despite finishing with a time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached his career high by measuring a clock.
The world records set in Berlin for the 9,58-meter and the 19,19-meter dashes are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his goal of breaking the 200-meter world record by 19 seconds, but no one believes it will happen except Bolt himself.
Bolt's toughest challenger in the 100 is 2004 Athens Olympic 100m champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt beat the American by just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has not lost a final in his reign since he started in Beijing, if he's ever been on the road.
In Daegu, 2011 World Cup final of 100 km, Bolt was disqualified for cheating.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's game, and the Rio Olympics are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set his career's final goal for next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in a Sports Illustrated interview.
Rio revelations: two athletes suspected of doping
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, 18-year-old Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
A Chinese drug dealer named Chen Xiny was found to be doping with banned substances.
I also suspect that Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is involved in a doping offence.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic trainer was sent home for giving a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with evidence of the hormone epo.
She placed fourth in the women's 100-meter butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese national has taken his doping case to the International Court of Justice for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample provided by Xinyi on Sunday would have found traces of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have been other doping cases in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female obstacle racer Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with evidence of the hormone EPO.
Kenya, on the other hand, has banned a Rio athletic trainer from his home for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample in his name.
According to media reports, the suspect is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps will stop at nothing to bring historic gold to the show.
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, the American Michael Phelps, swam the 200-meter medley in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
Phelps also became the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in the same event for the fourth consecutive time.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mixed doubles, ahead of China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun. The BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with the Evening Standard.
The story about Helen Skelton (ed.) on Monday is the most read story on the website of the Evening Standard this week.
And next to her is the news anchor Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get too stressed if there's a little buzz in the press or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
He says television is a visual medium.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a short dress, which I'm sure will at least have enough exposure for many conservative British viewers.
However, there is no prospect of any backtracking.
It's important to look good, and little boobs are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to calm down and maybe even shock, but he insists he doesn't want to be the lead.
He says it's not about me.
We're watching sports here, and we need to focus on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the height of the swelling?
I can't, but anything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers work and how great sacrifices they make is fine with me, Skelton grins.
You know what, man?
It's a fuss over nothing if it comes to the dress code.
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests on suspicion of terrorism.
Rio police announced Thursday that they have arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made the arrests as part of a security detail for the games.
The police made five other arrests in the same context and interrogated two persons before their release.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news website, the terrorism arrests are from the same group that police arrested in July.
The suspects are believed to have ties to the Islamic State terrorist organization.
The arrested were known to have incited violence on social media.
The violence was spread through popular WhatsApp, among other sites.
There are 85,000 police officers in charge of security at the Rio Olympics.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their opening game of the Rio Basketball Tournament in an empty arena on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball court and closed the venue to the public.
Police let the crowd in after they controlled the detonation of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled explosion.
Police have closed the arena after a suspicious package was found in the area.
The crowd was allowed in after the police had controlled the detonation of the package.
The crowd did not arrive for the game because police closed the arena after a suspicious package was found in the stadium.
The police detonated the package and then let the audience into the auditorium.
A drink woke up the Spanish team, who had started the race in a sleepy way.
Spain, which had started the tournament with two losses, beat Nigeria 96-87.
In the last two games, Spain won silver.
This is the third time police have carried out a controlled explosion during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to detonate a suspicious find near a road bike end was last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria opened their opening game of the Rio Basketball Tournament to empty spectators.
Argentine lady knocks out the Traitor Siren , Finnish woman thinks about protesting
Wind Traitor Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The Wind Traitor Sir was having a rough Thursday.
The Argentine lady wore the Wind Traitor Siren on Thursday at the opening ceremony of the Women's Surfing Day in Rio.
Clearly, the wind was broken.
The opponent admitted to the violation.
He was trapped in a car accident and the others fled, Finland's head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete thought long and hard about protesting.
Well, it wasn't worth doing, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
"I should have fallen into the water to get my reparation", said the Traitor Siren.
The Finn hung on his board until the end because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finn was 27th in the race after the accident.
Overall, the 2012 London Olympics silver medalist is eighth.
The head, it's not like the crash had any effect.
Friday's the big day. We're running the 10th and 12th.
Modified 0.39: Contrary to initial reports, Traitor Siren did not protest.
7 Unusual Things That Science Says Can Extend Your Life
Science has explored everything that exists between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some of these are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health and prolong his life.
At other times, things beyond one's control can add years to one's life.
These include a tendency to be overweight or have a social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don't have to go to the bathroom every time. Just go to the bathroom and get a can of milk.
The secret of longevity has been explored in many studies.
Medical Daily has seven of the strangest studies ever.
Science says all these things can add years to your life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with "a reduced risk of death", especially in the case of neurological or heart disease.
Again, in favor of alcohol, studies show that moderate use - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one researcher found that wine drinkers lived longer than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by up to six years, reports one study.
The claim is based on the claim that it prevents genital infections.
In turn, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found that laughter can also affect a person's life span.
The seven-year project followed more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to survive the experiment than those who laughed less.
Sex, when taken with the protection against STDs, is shown by many studies to be beneficial to health.
And besides, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is is not enough.
In order to add years to one's life, one must also have an orgasm.
Well, I'm sure being physically active will add years to your life.
However, longevity does not require absolute sobriety.
A study at Oxford University found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to low sheep mortality.
Whether an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he is more likely to live longer than the average bully.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers suspect that longevity is a function of a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible to seek awards such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behavior among people over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily was less likely to live as a parent who shops less.
This is because walking around a physical store reduces loneliness.
In turn, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause premature death.
So, count your credit card out of your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A drunk driver hit a truck with a drunk driver's license.
On Friday evening, a serious collision between a truck and a car occurred in Koske, Finland.
The accident happened on Kosk, between Koskenti and Sorvastonti on Friday at 9pm.
The truck had been heading towards Forssa when the passenger car that had been met had entered the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left on its lane after the crash, but then caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The car went into the ditch and then over the ditch to the roof.
A woman, born in 1972, was driving a passenger car. She was trapped in her car.
The rescue service removed the injured driver from the car and took him to the University of Turku Central Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test came back 2.02 percent.
He's a suspect in a DUI.
The post office sent the wrong candy to the wrong town .
The K-Citymarket's candy range was deficient because the post office had accidentally delivered part of the cargo to Seinäjo.
Teija Haltia, a resident of Pernió, was buying candy at the Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when he noticed a funny sign.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in the loose-leaf ones because the Post Office delivered our shipment to Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post Office gets the shipment delivered!
So unless there's a lot of traffic on the lawn, the sign said,
The sign of the merchant's fuss is related to the fact that the Post Office expanded its services last spring to include mowing the lawn.
The Post will be offering the lawn mower until the end of August.
The elf thought the sign was mostly funny, so he decided to share it on social media.
I was just blown away by the popularity of the update.
The media has been calling all the time, and the attention this has generated is incredible, Halti wonders.
By Friday night, Haltia's update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
The elf got his favorite to get caught in a bag of loose candy, even though a few fields were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, head of the Postal Service's transport business, apologized to the company.
The reason is that three of the five stages got lost yesterday in the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to do a part-time production (Salo) with three, but only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The Evening News was the first to report on the matter.
The Elf didn't get mad at the sign because he found all his own loose candy bars in the assortment.

The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has garnered several rave reviews from national scouts.
You are gorgeous.
We're on the same road, motivation's high, someone's glowing.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's do it now project.
I get so much energy and enthusiasm from your pictures, when I'm on the same journey, another says.
This spring, Lotta lost her last few pounds as part of the Let's Do It Now project.
At that time, he told the Evening Standard that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was then a distance of ten kilograms.
During the three months of physical therapy, I finally lost five pounds.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa wishes the memory of her victim to be donated to police dogs .
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that instead of flowers and addresses, the victim will be remembered by a donation to police dog work.
The Sipoon Veterinary Station has posted a Facebook update to share the victim's family's wish for donations to police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The vet station will remember her with touching words.
Cheerful, smart, with a sense of humor and no fear of work.
Good fellow.
We still can't quite comprehend that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number for donations.
The update states that the donation money will go entirely to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors have told the Evening Standard that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
The 27-year-old suspect in the murder did not know the woman and they had no connection.
The police dog Börje was also involved in the pursuit of the killer, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal ruled that the Post had violated the Equality Act.
The Court of Appeal held that the Post Office had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to inform the employee of the contract.
The Court of Appeal ordered Post to pay the employee the bulk of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 in compensation for the discrimination.
The judgment stated that Posti could only deduct from the salary of the surveyor a part corresponding to the part of the survey carried out during the whole day's work.
The Court of Appeal held that the employee had been placed at a disadvantage by reason of her trade union activity, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU's decision on the prohibition of consultation.
During the postal strike last November, the PAU made a decision that postal workers would not be consulted on strike-breaking hired workers.
It was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey must return to respect for human rights
The European Parliament also called on the Commission to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme is implemented in a manner that is consistent with the EU's nuclear programme.
The report also calls on the Commission to take a more active role in the implementation of the EU's external action plan.
The European Union has also been a major contributor to the fight against corruption and organised crime.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
Putin has replaced the head of his administration with a man of Estonian origin .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
He is succeeded by Anton Vaino, grandson of the Soviet-East Estonia Communist leader Karl Vaino.
He is a former member of the 'Russian People's Republic' and a former member of the 'Russian People's Republic'.
He will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Mr Ivanov, a close associate of Mr Putin, will be transferred to special posts in the environment and transport sectors, the Kremlin said in a statement.
Putin said Ivanov had asked to be transferred to other posts and suggested Vaino instead, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his post in 2011 before Putin was re-elected President in 2012.
ManU's giant ban ban won't be seen in the opening game of the Champions League.
The world record holder in football transfers will not be seen on the pitch as the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban from England was a consequence.
Manchester United giant Paul Pogba is out of action due to a suspension as ManU opens their league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba to Juventus, according to British media, 105 million euros.
However, the FA has kept Pogba out of the game, as Juventus have imposed a ban on Pogba.
He got two warnings last season in the Coppa Italia, and that's a one-game ban.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next game is in the second round of the league on August 19th, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The strict criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival as an internationally respected event featuring the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
The partygoers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival's event area is decorated with artificial turrets and art installations.
"We never had enough of just the main stage and the beer tent", says the event's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which is being held this weekend in Helsinki's Suvilahti, has grown from a small block party to an event with tens of thousands of visitors.
The key to success is a simple question: What kind of event would the people who make it want to go to?
It's a little weird in the news media to think that way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says the event's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 from last year's 70,000.
This year, the festival will also see a number of interesting local and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be financed.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being guided along vast trails.
We don't want that.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated to include 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurants and bars in the area, which is partly covered with a fake tower.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year's concert will be held in a tent with 15,000 people.
The Rock admits that the event could be performed more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've managed to keep the spirit of Flow alive.
If you lose it, this is no longer our case.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done on the rock is that even grand visions are now practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activities were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of around EUR 20 000.
Last year, the limited company operating Flow had a turnover of around EUR 6 million.
It can be used to accomplish "circular things", such as building that 250-foot-wide [73 m] tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in distinctive clothing.
In addition to the music event, there is a trendy community of young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to be different, above all, in content.
Yet, even fashion events fit into Flow's values of curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the featured artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his genre, but he's not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop, rap and soul.
Kallio says Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time he'll be seen on a show in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
I mean, I'm sure I'm not the only one who's been thinking about it.
The bombs were hidden in flower pots in a tourist paradise in Thailand .
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a vase and detonated by cell phones.
The bombs were planted on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
The blasts occurred as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a picture of the attacks that speaks volumes.
If the tweet doesn't show up properly, you can check it out here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said a bomb went off outside the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thanh.
At least one of them died.
The number of casualties is still unknown.
Very soon afterward, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, a favorite of Finns.
No one was killed, as far as we know.
Meanwhile, another double bombing was launched in Hua Hin.
At least one dead and three wounded.
And there was a bomb in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet detonated.
Thai authorities say the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel groups who are unhappy with the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities have estimated that there may be criminal organizations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken a hard line on criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the newly formed reserve forces goes into combat first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, soldiers are ordered to combat duties only several months after taking the oath of allegiance, says Central Finnish.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonnen, the head of training for the Armed Forces, who was interviewed by the magazine, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combat-ready.
The training director said that the first to be assigned to the service are reservists from the reserve forces.
No soldier or reservist is ordered to a task for which he has not received the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it emerged that the Armed Forces will begin training soldiers in the immediate-readiness units starting next year.
Units may be used in combat operations as early as during reserve training if necessary.
Pamela Tola got a huge settlement from the homestead .
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a bitter dispute over an apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of the two-storey detached house was EUR 330 000.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing a health-threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014 for scrap.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in an economic loss for Tola and Waroma of EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court, demanding a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and appellate courts.
The court of appeals ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a reduction of EUR 150 000.
The seller is also ordered to pay the couple's legal and administrative costs, totalling EUR 47 344.
The court justified the price reduction somewhat because some of the homes had been known to the buyers when the sale was made.
However, the Court of Appeal held that the construction errors which had been detected were substantially more serious than had been alleged.
Tola was looking for a good home .
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a good home because they did not want to undertake the renovation.
He had come to believe that the building was well repaired and in good condition and that there was nothing wrong with the features mentioned in the inspection report.
The municipal inspection report mentioned as risks and inconveniences ventilation and the inadequate management of rain and meltwater flowing along the cliff face.
However, the discussions did not reveal any urgency.
Tola and Waroma felt that rainwater from the rock might need to be diverted somewhat in a few years.
The transactions were concluded in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became clear that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than had been thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growths in the building, which the Witnesses said were caused by both the rock's rainwater and capillary moisture.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that air contaminated by germs could also enter the interior through the porch.
The samples of soot or yeast, which may pose a health risk and exceed the limit values, were found in the household room, the cellar staircase, the living room window sill and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without a permit.
The court also discussed whether the apartment had been enlarged in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that the apartment had been altered in violation of the permit before the sale.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although the proper permits had not yet been obtained.
However, the home issues were a central issue in the court case.
The Court of Appeal held that the buyers could assume, on the basis of information obtained from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for housing as it was and that no major renovations were needed in the immediate future.
The Court of Appeal considered that there was no particular reason for Tola and Waroma to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
The Court of Appeal held that the purchasers had not failed to fulfil their obligations under the contract.
A shocking discovery in the archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - including Finns in the register
In a recent article in Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson reports that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilmed documents on a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi bridesmaids.
The documents and registration cards are from the race bureau in Nazi Germany.
The Race Bureau operated under the direction of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true in even greater numbers of women who were expected to be able to bear up to 10 or more children.
According to Andersson, the women were given gynecological examinations to determine the cause.
The race bureau investigated the women's background, including by examining church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be willing to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to give the Swedish Race Bureau handwritten biographies and good recommendations from relatives.
The race bureau wanted assurances that the women were "child-lovers", "savvy", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either out of wedlock or in marriage.
The Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, says the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for having children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honour was awarded to women who had borne at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryan" and "non-Aryan" were forbidden by law, says the museum's website.
Traitor-Sir, in the sixth, the Squirrel rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first race of the Finnjollie Day sailing event at the Rio Olympics, but was left behind in the second race.
Nirkko moved up to eighth overall after five starts, but a second-lap failure dropped him to 14th.
Wind Traitor-Siren fought in the RS:X class on the day of the start 17th and third.
Overall, Traitor Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd at the opening day break.
Overall, the Lindgren's are 19th.
Jari Bridgeland Satulinna was recorded during a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so upset"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland's favourite artists for over 20 years.
From a cruise ship bartender to the tango king of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää is still able to cheer and is currently on a furious rise.
The book written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Nakjaana, was published today, Thursday.
In his book, Bridgehead, he tells of his life and career, for better or worse.
His career took off when he won the King of Tango crown at the Seinäjoen Tango Market in 1995.
In the race, Bridgehead sang tango, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The song "Satulinna" became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so upset!
The bridgehead is in the book.
You wouldn't know it from a recording of a huge hit song that it was sung in a hangover.
I wasn't at my best physically, but the trail was good.
I learned that you don't have to expect perfection and excellence all the time.
The second incident involving his favorite songs, described in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää separated from her then-partner and the affair eventually ended with lyrics to the song "You Deserve Gold", which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics Saara ordered from Törmässö were not what Bridgehead would have wanted.
The bridge had imagined that it was a record that told the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the breakup were not true, but were based on a story in the newspaper 7 Days.
A newspaper article in the newspaper said that Jari's ex-girlfriend broke up with him because of his excessive partying and alcohol use, but Jari said that was nonsense and not true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company in a rage and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and good for her.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting to leave the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted to leave and 48% would have stayed in the EU, despite the contrary opinion polls of the week.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of remaining in the EU.
No respected research institution or university flagged a dissent, even though a few individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the slogan of the recent election campaign of former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", was dropped in the trash in the UK Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
The economic curve
The Centre for Macroeconomics is asking the trade community for answers to the Brexit disaster in its latest monthly survey.
The most common answer is that economists were not heard, because this time the voters decided on non-economic criteria.
One of the explanations economists give for the loss of economic status is that people don't understand economics.
Many people still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, that is, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the realm of the British.
Many also feel that a decline in the value of the currency would be a good thing, since it would promote export industries.
The Committee of the Regions believes that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly irritated by the BBC's bias, which gave as much room to pro-EU economists representing only a few per cent of the economic community as to the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in telling what the IFS, the IMF, the BoE, the CEPR and the LSE and other economic powerhouses thought of the consequences of the divorce.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were ignored because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters themselves do not feel they have a common interest.
While academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy too.
The overwhelming argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant overcrowds your hospital, an immigrant uses you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would there be for the British if they left?
Every health center in the world has a waiting room full of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for a Britishman to get medical appointments if there were no doctors?
Every school in the country has immigrant kids.
How much easier would it be for a real British child to get into school if they were to be put out of business?
Every municipality has foreigners.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
But economists have not been able to answer them, and even if they have, their answers have not gained traction.
Economists have failed to explain that immigrants have given the British more jobs, fewer lines in health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK budget and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish investment manager Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that in Aberdeen, preparations for Brexit were made in good time by drawing up plans A and B.
The preparations for the victory of Plan B, the pro-Brexit camp, began in more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a 'leave'.
There was a concern that investors would start pulling their money out of the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they may be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only daily open-ended listed real estate fund that the news touched on.
The old man said the normal level would be 15 to 20 percent.
The value of the fund at that time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest of the nine open-ended real estate funds, says Vanhanen, of all the open-ended real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest cash in these funds remained at 10 percent or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the trading.
When the pro-Brexit camp won, Europe went crazy.
The real estate market was relatively calm in the two weeks following the vote, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he assessed that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they plundered the situation and made headlines in the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to roll and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash raised, but it too eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
The old man said they didn't actually close the deal. They changed the price down.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worthwhile to withdraw the money in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to withdraw your money now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed things down, and most of them called off the report.
Since then, the market has been fairly stable, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar surge in Aberdeen's Continental Europe funds.
But there were a lot of questions.
Unfairly focused on real estate funds
The old man thought the closing of the real estate fund's trades got unduly attention.
The open-ended funds affected by the closures control around 4% of UK property.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold off less than 10 of its 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it may hold its fund closed for part of 2017.
The current climate of uncertainty and the downward trend in economic growth forecasts do not seem to be getting any 'worse' for Aberdeen.
The major questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen notes.
The pound and the dollar are at their lowest in 30 years, and the market is selling 15% lower than it was before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
Old Man says there's a lot of buyers willing to buy.
Brexit has brought down London's housing market.
At 2:00 a.m., the situation still didn't look too bad.
But at 4am, when Pertti Vanhanen, head of real estate investment at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British real estate fund, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's a powerful word, your head.
I realised that this was going to be part of plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
The City of London was already alive and well, despite the dawn.
The television screens in the office, normally silent, played the news, and the usually noisy crowd fell silent to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to announce his departure this morning.
When the market opened, the ends of the stage flashed red.
It was the kind of morning Vanhanen never thought he'd live to see, says Vanhanen.
Not that, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest property funds, completed two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mixed bag.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, and therefore the situation was somewhat calm, Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote started a movement to fix it.
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market was beginning to anticipate sharp declines in the UK and particularly in London's housing market.
London office space was forecast to decline by up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after another.
Aberdeen did the same for six days.
Now the poison has subsided, but the air is still uncertain.
It is not, however, reflected in the face of Old Man, who spent his last days of summer vacation in Helsinki this week.
He said it was too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
So much remains to be seen: how the separation will take place and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial information on the development of the London property market has already been received.
The price developments data from CBRE, a real estate services company, cover around a third of the market.
They found that prices for all London properties fell by 3.3 percent between June and July.
In the City of London, the decline was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index was started in 1987, and only five months have seen worse numbers, says Vanhanen.
All the declines were of equal magnitude in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared very quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US housing market.
The elderly man feels that the comparison is not entirely fitting, since this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
I don't feel the same way.
The real estate market is not experiencing the panic sales of that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
I mean, you can always find the funding.
The repair shop could have been ahead anyway .
In fact, he is not surprised that the price fixing movement could have been on the horizon even without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that property prices in London and other major cities around the world have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years now that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started from really high.
London prices have soared for four reasons, Old Man's List.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has the population of London.
The second big trend is that real estate is the last asset class to be globalized, says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutional and private investors are looking for foreign real estate investment.
London is known as a city of easy target.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies to seek returns from new sites, for example.
In addition, credit has been readily available - although according to Vanhassen, the leverage ratio is now significantly lower than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
- I'm going to break it up.
In London, the price rise leveled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also started to reduce his holdings in London, and he was a net seller last year.
I was expecting some kind of turn, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He's not afraid to predict the future, but he says there's little hope of any upward movement.
The mood suggests a downward or steady trend.
Old man has seen a lot of ups and downs since he's been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the only way out of the hole is to work.
If you're prepared to take risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you've diversified, you've diversified the risks, says Vanhanen.
Group S is starting to record more accurately than before
The S Group knows what you're eating because the retail group announced today that it's starting to collect more accurate data on the purchases of its regular customers.
Once the final amount of the receipt has been collected, the team will start to collect it from the products purchased in early May.
Group S follows Kesko in this respect, as the data on goods purchased with the plus card have been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes subject to authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
"It is a very rare customer who has refused to use product information", Riitala told Taloussanom.
He said Kesko has no intention of reacting to the change in registration of Group S.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups based on their food purchases alone.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
The main customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount spent on them.
The data will be used for customer-driven marketing.
Product-specific purchasing data are collected only from the K-group's own chains.
The partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a fixed client programme and there are no plans for this round.
Finland's local market has its own first-class bonus customer base, which can be joined at the local markets, Siwo and Euromarket.
We are not currently collecting information at product or product group level, we are staying at the receipt total level.
So we know where the purchases were made and when and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not reached the level of the K-group or the S-group, says Anu Ora, commercial manager.
He said the main customer programme was to be renewed in the future, but that the local shop would tell us more about it later.
However, Ora does not promise to start registering product information.
First , an experiment .
SOK's customer and owner register has been relatively extensive up to now.
The basic data included personal and address data, as well as occupation, education, residence and the children's birth years and previous personal data.
The persons belonging to the same household and their role are also registered.
The S-card store records the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of the purchase and the method of payment.
In addition, the information on S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, for S-markets, Prisma, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data are recorded at product group level for the time being.
Customers have long hoped that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK's Head of Owner and Partner Operations.
S Group says they'll notify their customers of the change.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
But the data is going to be stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you want it or not.
The applicant can check the data stored on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash registers do not have access to the data, Saarikoski stresses.
Video: Heila the puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
A black Labrador retriever's cub sniffs vigorously at five similar boxes lined up at Helsinki Airport.
It doesn't take long for it to sit firmly beside the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila for playing with his favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a can of gunpowder-scented shells was revealed.
The first smell that Heila has now been trained on is gunpowder, says Suntio, the owner of Heila's dog.
The main reasons for the security situation and online commerce
Heila is the first specialised gun and explosives dog at the customs and will be posted to Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Sunti to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will remain Heila's main employment location as the international security situation has changed following the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
Another main reason for training the weapons and explosives dog for customs duties is the postal consignments passing through Helsinki Airport.
With the growth of Internet commerce, the airport handles up to 40 million mail items a year, some of which may include weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, the customs authorities have made a discovery at Helsinki Airport of approximately 300 items of online shopping, passenger luggage and air cargo, including weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, and their starting materials.
Heila will be working in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be looking into checked baggage and mail.
It will be of great benefit in the future in the port, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Churchnum
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull Dog School in Kirkkonum.
Suntio also goes to train with Heila with police and Defense Forces experts.
The police have a strong background in dog training and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila is trained to recognize.
Grönberg says that Heila is always given further training as needed.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the customs' six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Lady Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include its agility and hunting instincts, as well as its calmness in dealing with weapons, explosives and human traffic.
Heila, who lives at Sunti's home, is a close coworker of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heil from the box.
The cameraman of the Evening News loses the camera's mic cover for the fast dog, but Heila restores the cover, which looks like a soft toy, at the command "go".
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila's graduating from elementary school next year.
There are still proficiency tests to be held in October to assess whether the training is sufficient for the demanding job.
Heila can be seen on duty at Helsinki Airport in the second half of next year, if all goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet a dog with a work vest on, Suntio reminds.
The cost to the customs authorities of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
They work for about seven or eight years, even ten, and then they retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active shifts last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There's a lot of competition in Customs for working dogs.
Heila's got about 20 to 30 customs workers applying to be his owner.
The lucky man was Suntia, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory duties at Customs.
The mini-state won its first Olympic medal. The people get a day off.
The country of Fiji, with a population of less than one million, holds such high regard for its Olympic gold medalist in rugby that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is the day after the team gets home.
The hero team will also have a party in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The final was watched in the capital, Suva, with a screen installed in the stadium, reports The Guardian.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering", said Fiji Times columnist Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Riga: Finnish weightlifter passed out after a brutal performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard fight at 175 kilos.
The hook has a special and life-threatening property for lifting.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to tell me why.
In Rio, Tokola weighed 175 pounds for pushing and 145 pounds for snatching.
His joint was 320 kilos.
The warehouse tried to get his job with the last one, 175 kilos, as well as the other one.
On the third attempt, the weights rose with a violent scream.
His body trembled under the weight of the weight until the jury agreed to lift him.
The Finnish lifter's joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired Estonian striker Prosa .
The Rovaniemi Football Club, which plays in the Men's Football League, has signed an extension to the end of the season with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a top player in our team with potential and a small chance of getting to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We've worked with over a dozen player agents to go through over 50 players from all over the world.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a press release.
Prosa, 25, joins RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored 51 goals in 109 appearances.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoen, where the Rovaniemi will face the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's country king, Alexander Kokko, moved to Australia.
The great Modern Family star is showing off again: teenage shorts reveal almost everything.
Ariel Winter, known as the nice Alex Dunphy of the sitcom Modern Family, is once again showing off her formidable body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in miniature shorts that leave little room for the imagination.
The shorts not only revealed the actor's legs, but also his butt.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by making a dramatic change in her style and behavior.
The star has appeared in her photos posted on social media in very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very scanty clothes.
Winter, now approaching adulthood, has also recently posted several photos of herself celebrating.
If you can't see the picture, you can watch it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
She's been on television most of her life and she grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you see of a bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started on Modern Family when she was only 11.
The actor has angered some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It is not hard to see where he will be in ten years' time, when the downpour is already so severe", says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of her fans, however, defend the actress and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone says.
You're an inspiration to many women, a shining young woman.
Japanese people prefer the Nordic countries to Finland , attracting tourists with a spotlight , where in autumn it is possible to see the fairy-tale mirror aurora .
The campaign is designed to encourage Japanese people to start lighthouses in early autumn, says a Visit Finland press release.
The main tourist destinations of the Japanese are Inari and Levi.
The reign cards of our winter tour are the reign cards, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and the snowy landscape.
The demand for winter light tours in Lapland is very high, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn tours.
Few people know that the spring season begins in early autumn and continues well into spring.
In autumn, the mirror aurora can be seen, with the lake surface reflecting the rays of the sun, making the sight twice as fabulous, says Anne Lind, vice president of marketing at Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's spotlight campaign is aimed at wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 who live in cities and dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising, among other things.
A survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo shows that Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the country among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more clear and unique sights of Finland, and this lighthouse has huge potential, according to Lind.
The number of overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly more than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as much time in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese tourists are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
The average Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to settle for silver in the rugby sevens competition as Fiji's championship team won gold.
Great Britain's impressive run of success in the seven-man rugby tournament was shattered when Fiji beat it 43-7 in the final on Thursday at Rio's Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji provided a master class in ball handling, passing, passing, passing, line, and power, winning gold  if that was the country's first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The loss meant silver, which was a slightly more than a consolation for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day.
The tight 75 win over South Africa Boxer in the semi-final earlier in the day could have affected the team negatively in the finals.
Nevertheless, the Fiji team in this form would have beaten the British even if the 15-man squad had been at full strength.
The United Kingdom may take comfort in the fact that at least one Briton will be awarded the gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, a former England rugby sevens coach from Wimbledon.
It has been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Losing is painful, but the progress is staggering.
Fiji started off brilliantly and showed off his tackling skills to the British as if for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had crashed into a crowd of moving buses, and the world champions took a 5x0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a cornering jump.
With four minutes left on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored the second goal on the right side of the goal kick.
The score was 12-0 and the British had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle prevented the rational Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it didn't slow Fiji's run for long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Veremalu scored in the right corner, leaving Great Britain 170 down.
Nakarawa scored the second goal from the penalty spot with just over a minute left in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then rushed through the British team's even weaker tackles and jumped over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended at 290.
It seemed that Fijians were born to play seven-man rugby, while the British are still in the game as apprentices.
Which is pretty much true.
Great Britain made extensive changes at half-time and managed to hold the Fijians for a full four minutes, a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the Fijians' excellent team play.
Dan Norton narrowed the situation to 36-7 with a goal for Great Britain in the left corner, but the game was long lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in front of them.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's pure, joyful attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final pass to the Fijian cake by scoring a goal in the last few minutes.
The bell rang, the Fijians embraced, and the British fell to the ground, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan in the semi-final by 205 and Great Britain had been eliminated by South Africa in a close semi-final, where the draw was decided by a British goal.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxers to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his stunning footwork and fell under the goal posts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-man rugby team, Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold.
It's the most emotional gold medal you could get in this competition.
From first bet to last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 victorious bets into history and found additional purpose to their golden moment at the Estacio da Lago.
Although they were two in the air, the third boat was echoed by the voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to win their second consecutive Olympic gold in women's doubles, making them the first women in British sporting history to achieve such a feat.
Their superiority was undeniable, their 39th consecutive victory and once again a record.
What we see, two great athletes joining on the surface of the water like swans, does not quite match the nature of success.
Behind every single rookie, there's a huge group of helping hands, each of which has helped lead the other two to success, but most important of all is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who didn't know if he'd see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be removed.
If it hadn 't been for the surgery , it would have spread everywhere .
And it would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think a little bit".
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate that Williams was able to begin his treatment outside the racing season in early 2014, when the suspension caused the least amount of harm, if you can even say that now in these circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to get well quickly.
It was a motivator.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward six, nine, and 15 meters at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's where it starts.
The row itself is a journey, but this made it a little bit bigger".
Immediately after the win, the two were thinking of Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more normally as he tried to overcome his own anxiety.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery, who had just completed a tour of Afghanistan, says: "I've been feeling a bit of a wreck this week, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much".
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much work Helen and Robin and I have done together.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's cash flow has been fantastic.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not have asked for a better person to train with or a better coach".
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The duo have found a superior rhythm that their rivals have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 meters, as the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very much caught up in the moment.
Helen was like, "Stay with me, stay with me".
It is vital that we do not stray from the path".
"We did well to get out, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything extraordinary.
We weren't reaching for the skies today, we just wanted to do a good rowing and win the race, which we did".
The two of them spend a year thinking about their future.
Glover is celebrating his wedding next month to Steve Backshall , a friend from the nature show .
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on me".
"It took me about six months after London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was under a lot of stress.
This time, it took about four minutes to come to.
This feels so much better", she says.
Iceland replaces government corrupted by Panama leaks
Iceland is to hold early parliamentary elections in October, as demanded by protesters angered by the Panama leaks as early as this spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes by using tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned over the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The date for the election has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the recent public anger will affect the outcome of the fall election.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of those in power was evident, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he called Obama the founder of ISIS .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has canceled his latest presidential address.
He said he was being sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama is the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in its creation.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the remarks and demanded an apology from Trump.
"No one should ever be allowed to be commander in chief of the military who can sink that low", Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the Muslim-famous burkini, a covering swimsuit, from swimming pools, reports the Guardian newspaper.
A resolution signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that beaches and swimming are forbidden to anyone who does not wear a good-natured and secular swimsuit.
The decision also states that swimsuits that prominently express religious affiliation may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two men linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the Oulu region's bathing water has passed the filter
The water sampled from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meets the quality standards for bathing water.
Only the beach of the lake has been found to have a blue-greenish sandstone deposit.
The Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing beaches in the Oulu region on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Concentrations of E. coli and intestinal enterococci in all bathing water, except the beach of the sea bass, were below the limits of measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E. coli and enterococcal levels were confirmed in the seaweed beach water on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels were below the action limits.
The bluish-green sediment found on the beach of Lake Washy does not yet render the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favourable conditions it can quickly turn into a bluish-green sediment, which forms blue-green algae on the surface of the water in the form of floats.
The Environment Agency is monitoring the situation with intensified inspections.
If the blue-green algae turns into blue-green algae, this shall also be indicated separately on the swimming pool bulletin board.
Check out the results of the bathing water samples here.
The Commission has also identified a number of other measures to reduce the impact of the forest sector on the environment.
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the Treasury's proposed budget for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of a generational gift tax on forest land.
The Ministry of Finance proposes that forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's objective is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct from the net capital income of the forestry business.
The idea of creating such a tool to promote the generation-to-generation shift in forestry is a good one, says forestry director Juha Hakkarainen of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (CFAF).
But the hack finds something to criticize about the tax reform bill.
The forest gift reduction is presented as a function of the net capital income of the forest owner.
It is the capital gain after deducting all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarais, the tax reduction would be more effective if it could be made directly from the income from the sale of wood.
The MSP's proposal is based on the assumption that a deduction from the net capital income of forestry prevents the loss of capital income of forestry from being deducted from other taxes.
A person like that would get a tax break even if he didn't sell the wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is not able to grasp it, says Hakkarainen.
The Commission has also decided to initiate a formal investigation procedure in respect of the aid scheme.
The proposal limits the tax reduction linked to the value of the forest to EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high for the Hook.
As such, he said, it would cut 82 percent of Finnish forest owners out of the reduction zone.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest ownership community, he says.
The WF is of the opinion that the border guarantees the objective of growth.
The forest policy has been taking forest gift reduction for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
The reason for this is the ageing of the forestry sector.
The CFP states that the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and that about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm caught motorists off Himanga . Two cars slammed into a ditch and collided .
There was a strange chase on the Himanga Fish River on Friday morning.
According to the emergency services, two cars in a row plunged into a ditch, after which the one behind hit the one ahead.
According to the fire chief of the day, Harry Pyle, the fall into the ditch was suspected to be caused by a large eruption of lava.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There's no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car ahead was uninjured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometers to Kalaji.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku may help to develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings of a research team led by academician Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of the tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells normally grow in such an environment.
Ivaska said that the cancer could be prevented from growing in the laboratory by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer drugs by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results are published on August 4 in the respected journal of cell biology, Nature Communications.
The trial of the family murder of Muho continues in court. The prosecutor demands a second murder conviction.
The family murder trial of Muho continues in court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family murder in Muhos.
The other received 8 years and 4 months for, among other things, murder and aggravated robbery committed as a juvenile.
The other is serving a 12-year sentence for a murder committed as a juvenile and a grand larceny.
The convicted murderer was also convicted of gross endangerment of traffic safety as a juvenile and driving without due process as a juvenile.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was appealed by the prosecutor, the applicants and the man who received a harsher sentence.
The prosecution is asking for a reduced sentence for a man convicted of murder committed as a juvenile to 12 years in prison.
They were fully conscious at the time of the crime.
The district court found that 17-year-old boys killed a man who worked as a child protective officer at the school in July last year.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder was sentenced to time served for attacking a school principal from behind, sitting on a living room couch.
The director had lost control and had led the young man to his room when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled with a wire, beaten and kicked in the head.
The opinion poll showed that both of the convicts were fully conscious at the time of the crime.
The court found that the youths had been planning to escape from their family home since at least the day before.
The world's longest-living reef shark, it doesn't reproduce until 156 years of age
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed as a glacial shark, reports a study published in the journal Science.
In the north Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, known as the holler, can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156 years old.
The glacier's life span is further enhanced by its increasing by only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to outlive ice sharks.
Scientists used radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the body.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950's, some sharks had radioactive residue.
Using these, researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although a throw in one direction or another could be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump as a businessman
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world to change.
As much as a third of all federal tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's corporate tax reforms were implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, especially with tax breaks for the richest.
Trump described his tax plan as revolutionary when he unveiled it Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax rate would be reduced from 35% to 15%.
Without it, we'd be left with a very large sum, a billion dollars a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 after Trump's proposed cut to 33.
The inheritance tax would be waived completely.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating business and bankrupting small businesses.
The hastily agreed environmental standards must be re-established and energy regulation abolished.
Barack Obama's health care reform must be reviewed.
The government must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump says "destructive" trade policies are the biggest cause of America's problems.
The free trade agreements would be abandoned.
The Commission's proposal is to introduce a 45 per cent penalty tax on imports from China and a 35 per cent penalty tax on imports from Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
"Americanism, not globalization, is our creed", Trump declared.
Donald Trump 's America is the only country in the world that needs a change:
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his usual style, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by his aides, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see Trump's program as driving the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early Friday, Finnish time.
A tidal wave from the past
The sea is raging with a fatal storm, but a real tidal wave is brewing in the heart of a penitent Madrid. The reckoning with the past may begin.
That is the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novel story.
Almodovar's previous directorial effort, Travelers (2013), was a small-scale, rontgen-oriented satirical comedy, preceded by I Live in a Skin (2011) the pinnacle of the Spanish director's career.
Julieta (2016) is somewhere in between.
It's a classic, soft drama of love, relationships, family, with a mother and daughter at the center.
The story is simple and we see it in a lot of the long-running back stories.
Life seems to be a smooth ride for a middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to fall apart.
In the aftermath of a chance encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is left in awe until the last few seconds of the film.
In the form of a backstory and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life to her grown daughter.
She starts with the time before her daughter was born, the moment she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
The second female lead is Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, known for the TV series Ommeltenen aika (2013-2014).
Juliet's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a cluster, but I would say rather subtly and literally with a wipe.
Often characteristic of Almodóvar films, Juliet is a fair distance from the flamboyantness and humor.
It is a well-acted, restrained, occasionally well-musiced and rather melancholy film, with elements of elegia as such.
Instead, the visual colorfulness typical of the Spanish director is preserved, and it is gradually becoming more striking as a pure form factor than as a functioning dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are plagued by illness, death, or other sudden losses, but the surface remains the same.
This is especially true of the costume: in the case of a celebrity, the costume changes from scene to scene, and the same is true of showy earrings.
Almodóvar is very precise in these matters, but the main thing, the tuning of the scene in question, is not much improved.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and a little lifeless.
Almodóvar has written the screenplay based on three novels by the Canadian novelist Alice Munro, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature.
The novels have been published in the book The Runaway: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat balanced literary filmmaking.
The film's theme deals with such big issues - especially the sinking guilt - that it would have been the ingredient for an emotionally intense drama.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
The film stars Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao and Dario Grandinetti. It was released on July 15, 2015.
The movie opens on the 12th of August.
The government is trying to rig the election .
No new cuts, the ministers are saying, so that the Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are made in a junk shop.
There will be no more cuts.
The four billion already agreed to save is enough.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
It is true that the CoR's proposal does not contain any new cuts, since the cuts to social security were decided on in the spring framework.
The family allowance, the national pension, the basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400 days.
The training cuts are still in effect.
The Municipal Elections Are Haunting
Why do ministers insist so emphatically that no further cuts should be made to these people?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the election season, not the polls.
It has been seen in the past that a result in a municipal election that leads the governing parties in different directions spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, Gallup reports that the ruling party, the Finns of the Left, is expected to suffer a crushing defeat, despite its modest 12.3% result in the previous elections.
Four years ago, the Fundamentalists won 752 new councillors, many of whom will pay the price of their influence in a rightwing government next spring.
The lifeline of the three governments of approximately equal size depends on the survival of the Finnish base.
Now it has not lasted, and more than half of the party voters had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's position have also come to the surface.
The rhetoric of no new cuts is, firstly, to obscure the fact that they will be made in a big way next year and, secondly, to try to soften the blow that basic Finns are waiting for.
Major surgery in 2018?
In a year, things will probably be different if the Squirrel government is still in power.
The government has set itself the objective of reducing debt this election year, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take on a debt of EUR 5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise our hands in the middle of an election cycle and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: the debt is not being paid or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
This means further, even more severe cuts on top of the old ones in the 2017 budgetary period.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring parliamentary elections, we will face what comes.
These measures did not reduce the debt
It is quite clear that the current measures have not helped to reduce the debt, despite Juha Sipilä's efforts to create a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäe at the budget briefing are proof of this:
The forecasts for global growth have repeatedly proved to be academic, meaning that there is no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recovered much since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has risen by 35 percent in this decade, rising on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros more per year than in 2008.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet adopted any specific recommendations on the restructuring plan.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt settlement proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected as being irresponsible.
The cost of maintaining unemployment next year is about EUR 6 billion, which will be covered almost entirely by new debt.
This is the idea of the Centre, the association and the Finnish people about what is responsible.
Question: Many tasks are left to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and sport is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
The vast majority of the population also assigns responsibility for libraries, culture, civic education, building control, secondary education and waste management to individual municipalities.
The responsibility of the Länder is more clearly defined in the areas of regional planning, specialised health care, vocational training, vocational colleges and institutional care for the developmentally disabled.
No tasks of municipal order are to be transferred to the State.
A juvenile driver was driving under the influence of alcohol and ran away from the police at the end of the chase .
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu fled a police patrol on Ilomantsintie in Joensuu on Friday night at 1:30 a.m.
Police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man ran away from the police at a fairly high speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanprand, then to Sorronahonti and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle went off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster-moving policeman caught up with the fugitive.
The breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per millimeter.
He also did not have a license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was carrying the rocks fell into the ditch.
The truck, loaded with rocks, fell into a ditch at Kolvijärv on Kaavinti Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had veered off the road at a left-hand corner and had fallen on its side into a ditch.
The rescue team lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter crew and paramedics.
The car was to be hauled by the owner.
The truck that fell spilled hydraulic oil onto the road, which the rescue team absorbed into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in the Wind River.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in the Gulf of Ilmajoen in the southeastern part of the country.
Police are looking for a woman about 5'6", thin and stocky, with white hair that reaches down to her chin.
Any observations or clues about the missing person's movements are requested by calling the Nordic Situation Centre on 0295440513.
The elements of the great accident in the air . See the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest .
The falling tide that toppled the tents of the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of the Riverside Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be able to recover financially and that the event could be held again next year.
The last performer of Parafest Kalle Salonen performed on the market stage at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the city theater, starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Center in Ahjos is hosting a Parafest exhibition at 1 to 3 p.m.
The program will be organized as planned.
A downpour is created in a thundercloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a downward flow of air.
The changes in the water shape of the thunder cloud bind heat, and as a result, the falling air cools and accelerates its speed toward the earth.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that fall flows occur in Finland several times during the summer.
The path of the falling currents is difficult to predict.
A downpour hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, the site of the Parafest, Friday afternoon just before 5:00.
Three tents fell apart, and there were about 200 people in total.
Four people suffered minor injuries in the accident.
Among them was a child who was taken to the emergency room with minor injuries.
Air pollution is aging Londoners
A study shows that Londoners age faster than normal.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British investigation is reported by the Evening Standard.
British skincare company Caci analyzes the most toxic particles in London's air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many Londoners of retirement age have skin two and a half years older than their rural counterparts.
Skin-aging particles are a very fine dust pollution from transportation fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory illnesses that kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
The CAC study found that premature aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who commute by walking near busy streets.
Londoners may try to protect themselves from air pollution by wearing masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor brakes failed . He pushed the man in front .
The man had been moving rocks in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor fell on him.
The man was not hit, but the tractor managed to push him enough to take him to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor could not go any farther because it hit the rocks in front of it.

Garchet is a corresponding dealer, the Brazilian is 198 centimeters.
Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. National Team.
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Salibandy Championship since 2003.
Now in its sixth year, Tampere is missing only 2013 as Canada was better in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku, playing with the local women, when I saw the ad.
The U.S. was setting up a national team for the Salibandi.
I got interested, and here we are, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensu, the sport was not yet played at the SM level as salibandy.
They used to play chess in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in the SM-liiga in the Rokipoika.
Jumppanen played for the university team in the SM-liiga of salibandy in the season 1991-92, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-Team girls to the state championship.
The women's SM series peaked at silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-liiga 10 times, with a total of 169 matches.
The last SM season was 2001-02.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänäinen were named to the national team
Josba, a member of the Salibandy team from the River Island, was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen, a native of Enna, was selected to play for the Finnish national team in the Czech Republic's Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
The 25-year-old attacker Perttu Puska has played this game in Helsinki's Erä before six men's matches in which he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
Switzerland's 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from hip pain and is a regular in the national team with 117 caps.
The national team also included Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Cup in December.
The head coach of the Salibandy national team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volleyball great Essi Hassu's circle closes to Kouvola, missing the SM gold from the prize pool.
Essi Hasu is retiring as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championship will be decided this weekend at the Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals will be contested in both the adult and youth categories.
The SM-final tournament, organised by Kouvola Flight Flyers and the Finnish Flight Football Association, will be contested by the top six pairs in each series.
The local team is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volleyball team for many years.
Now living in Helsinki, Hasu looks forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible can get in the theater this weekend.
I'm sure baseball stadium is gonna be a great arena.
I haven't played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu feels.
The Kouvola region sparked Hassu's passion for sports and provided a fine meal for a fine pastime.
I'm sure you'll have many memories of your childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of nine in the E-girls of Elimäe NMKY.
The main thing in mind is the oversized jerseys, the knee-highs on the ankles, and the tremendous ace-screams and choreography after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were very involved - the father of a teammate coached us, and our mother was the club president for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural for the sport as a counterweight to indoor volleyball in junior.
The curved pool beach has been playing a beat since the 1990s.
The activity on the runway has always been active.
I also went to see the Junior SM Tour side events myself, thinking that one day I would be there playing myself.
Now this dream is coming true when Hasu plays this weekend alongside the beatnik Anniina Parkis in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked duo in the tournament, the goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still have the SM gold missing from the prize box, and Hasu throws it puzzlingly.
This weekend's performance in Kouvola may be Hasso's last in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await us in the civil service.
I'm sure after the Little Rock tournament, my international career will be over.
Otherwise, the toenails will be nailed, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli boldly set out to become a farmer
Farming as an entrepreneurial activity involves risk-taking, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside.
Just two years ago, Koli and his younger brother, Walter, began to operate as a continuation of their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and counsels the brothers from his own experience.
Starting out as a farmer meant taking on debt and expanding the farm so that the bread could come from farming.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always enjoyed working on a farm, and now that I'm starting my own business, I've put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you should do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a backyard water system, and at first, the bank wasn't too keen on it.
However, I was very brave to join the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out for the better.
Salomon Kol, a meat-carrier, is planning to invest in an even larger hub.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected as one of the top ten in the Rural Future magazine's Young Food Producer competition.
Right now, he's competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the paper's website until August 21.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in July.
This is the highest level in many years (since June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since October last year, when the country reported positive inflation of 0.2%.
The Commission notes that the CPI measures the inflation rate of the Union industry in the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) and the CPI measures the inflation rate of the Union industry in the last 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015).
The Commission established the profitability of the Union industry by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties on the measures taken by the GOC to implement the measures in force.
Compared to the previous month, July 2016 saw an increase in prices for the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %), transport (1,8 %), leisure and culture (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), other goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, appliances and periodic care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime effects are being criticized as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racist.
Snapchat's lens tool allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that approach the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are unadorned, distorted features, and they create over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any misdirection will quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have received criticism, accusing it of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes curly, twisted their teeth and turned their cheeks into puffs, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people.
Critics also wondered if these recurring conflicts point to a larger problem the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, reported by The Verge and Motherboard, among others, a day after Snapchat said it had removed the filter.
The company explained that the lens was intended to honor anime characters, not caricatures of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes.
Some were fiercely opposed to the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet of the images was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at the very least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It is hard to deny the analogy between the very tasteless Asian carrot and the effects of a filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a yellowface, but one taken to a degrading extreme".
Snapchat isn't the only company that has to avoid these cultural traps.
There seems to be an endless struggle in American culture for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood to the devices we carry around with us.
Snapchat's large audience is made up of young people who are more ethnically diverse than their parents' counterparts, which may mean they are likely to expect even more subtlety.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, this kind of thing is not as easily overlooked as it used to be", said Katie Zhu, 25, in an interview Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer at the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In a Medium article and phone interview, he said he believed that the ethnic conflict reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruiting practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly white and all-male management and ended his post with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they have no people of color in their one-sided staff to make these kinds of decisions, or they have people of color in their workforce, but they don't have the position to be able to express themselves directly and easily", says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely not responded to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups and promoting inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he's keeping his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this isn't OK".
A congressional panel of experts says military officials falsified intelligence on ISIS.
A congressional panel of experts released a report on Thursday that officials at the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in a more optimistic light than what the events on the ground suggested.
The Republican chairs of the House Armed Services Committee's Intelligence and Defense Appropriations subcommittee formed a task force to produce a midterm report on "general dissatisfaction" among military intelligence analysts who say senior military officials have overstated their assessment of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, abbreviated Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior leadership of Centcom generally provided a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism operations than the facts on the ground and were invariably more positive than the analyses of other intelligence services", the report's press release said.
"The Centcom events cannot be tolerated  our troops suffer when false analyses are presented to high-level policy makers", says California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
"The mistakes of the Centcom leadership reach to the highest levels of the organization".
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 that Central Command's descriptions and analyses of US training activities for Iraqi forces contain.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports commissioned by the Obama administration were falsified, it does provide an analytical picture that suggests that Centcom leaders pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than what was actually happening", the report says.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military offensive to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear", says Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence officials in the U.S. military manipulated intelligence to reduce the threat of ISIS in Iraq".
The Republicans formed the task force after learning of analysts' suspicions that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will be followed by more detailed results as investigations continue.
In addition, the inspector general of the Department of Defense has launched an investigation into the Centcom intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which were in part consistent with the findings of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly narrow process to evaluate intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces", says Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic member of the committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the release of intelligence, 'undermined analysts' morale' and 'dissatisfied dissent.'
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to conform their conclusions to a "predetermined or official political line".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of a congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general that was launched in response to complaints by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these critical national security issues".
The investigation has other implications besides the fact that it seeks to establish whether the US-led bombing raids in Iraq and Syria have been successful (as claimed by several defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year raised questions about the level of trust President Obama can place in Central Command and its honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of ISIS intelligence is consistent with the disagreement that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study showing that the Bush administration, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only small forces in Iraq and spent little time considering the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against intelligence on ISIS.
According to the authorities, last year Hooker's task force concluded that despite conflicting public statements, the airstrikes on ISIL-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary refineries and thus was able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the investigation were not passed on outside Central Command, reported The Times in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after many lawmakers deemed testimony given to the Senate to be too positive a review of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced as commander of Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins its fourth matchup in women 's field hockey , consolidating its position in the British-American game .
After scoring three goals in the 61 win over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national field hockey team on Thursday, as the United States defeated India.
Five goals in two games might be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had ever achieved the same success.
"I have no idea", he says.
"I'm not one of those people who keeps track of what they paint".
But he knows this: The Americans have won four games and lost zero in their Olympic tournament, and they share first place in their group with Great Britain, which continued its winning streak by beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Each team advanced to the final round, which will determine which of them will place first and which second in the six-team blocks.
The first place team will avoid a long-term encounter with the Dutch team, which was considered tough and won the second block.
Regardless of how Saturday's game goes, the Americans have already boasted a surprise success in these games, four years after finishing last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first played hockey at the age of three (his twin sisters played at Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics after failing to make the final roster.
This was followed by the 2012 competition, where he and his team saw little success.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental, and physical", says Bam.
"Our work in London was not what it is now.
We have made a complete turnaround".
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a close-range punch.
India had entered the game without a single tournament win, but they proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and held their lead to 1-0 until the third period, when Bam stepped on the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the left side of the court, curled into the center, hit the ball into the goal, and led the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final touchdown in the fourth quarter.
The game was the first in the tournament in which U.S. goalie Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal clear, after the Americans had lost one goal in each of their first three games.
Briggs is in the prime of his career.
And so was Bam.
"Our investment is good now", says Parnham, "but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
♪ In the middle of the Olympic slope ♪ ♪ The trampoline brings Zen ♪
No matter where you are or what time you are, you're bound to run into the Olympics.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next passionate message constantly and everywhere.
It is as if the Olympic flame itself were a fiery message that is passed on from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast, and gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then there's a guy named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian, is charming with a smile and could well be a name on everyone's lips, seen and heard in prime time, a favorite of sponsors and a goodwill TV commercial if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for the Olympic gold medal in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Further out from the center, partially shadowed by the city, are lesser-known sports, such as air pistol shooting, archery, volleyball, and taekwondo.
We'll always have a breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a modest story about my own specialties, I want to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 games in Sydney, it has been so little seen for the past 16 years that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be geographic.
Although the United States has had athletes compete in the Olympic Games, it never won a medal or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the Chinese and Russians seem to be winning medals, and on the women's side, the medal room is filled with gray Canadians.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada are defending their gold medals this year, which they won in London.
But the trampoline has a low-level appeal, partly because to an uneducated ear, it sounds more like a circus school than an Olympic event.
(I admit that I am no expert, just a fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons for endless continuous bouncing scenes of characters, but it also has the same value as gymnastics and swimming, which are essentially the same sport as trampolining.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning "the board of rebellion".
Ambitious champions jump on a huge trampoline that propels them to a height of nearly 30 feet [10 m].
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged on performance, difficulty, and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries will compete in the world championship of trampoline strength, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic discipline is straight forward.
The medalists must go farther, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth across the field, to get to the gold.
In addition to the finish line or starting wall, they have another goal they strive for in television news reports, namely, a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is lofty, admirable, even fanatical  and is enough to make the viewer cry.
But I also find this a little tiring just watching the games.
This one, the trampoline, it's a breathing space.
The trampoline is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up without gravity like an astronaut, falls down and sinks back up without any effort.
Of course, there is a competitive aspect to the sport, and it is not easy either, but it is not a sprint to the finish or a long jump, but a dreamlike and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as an Olympic competition can get.
The women's qualifying and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and will begin at 1 p.m. local time, with the men's matches on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will be broadcasting the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, beginning at 2:00 p.m. local time on both days.
In the midst of the Olympics, they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might be overlooked in the midst of the public bustle.
And if awareness can only be raised by providing attractive male athletes to watch and objectifying them  as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested  then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his breathtaking new fan base.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States.
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently broken up demonstrations demanding political change across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia on the brink of collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been rocked by anti-government protests that are spreading to wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response was ruthless.
According to eyewitnesses, police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Videos of the demonstrations, allegedly taken late last year or early this year, show security forces beating young people with sticks, who are forced to stand with their hands against a wall.
The UN's top human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving it forward even harder", says Rashid Abdi, director of research for the Horn of Africa International Crisis Team.
Ethiopia is the second-largest country in Africa by population after Nigeria, and Western countries have contributed to its stability.
The US military and intelligence services are closely supporting the Ethiopians in their fight against the terrorist threat throughout the region, particularly in Somalia.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, with a new tramway in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets of cities are usually quiet, safe, and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from being a model democracy, with human rights groups continually reporting on the government's repressive policies, opposition in the country being very limited and dissent being quickly suppressed.
Many people have been driven out of the country, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But that may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to show their mind, they will break out", says Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
"All youths show their minds.
An entire generation protested".
There are many reasons for discontent, from land use to the strangulation of power by the ruling coalition.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last of the opposition's seats and now control the entire parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising on the Eritrean border, where a tense situation led to hundreds of deaths in fighting in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, more or less defeated in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the chaos and rearm.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been lurking for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It was only in the last couple of years that Ethiopians have been able to message on social media, as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and Internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many still access the Internet through proxy servers that hide their location.
Many Ethiopian youths said that this was how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the growing solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest groups, the Oromo and the Amharic.
The Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
The Amharas, who are from Ethiopia's mostly Christian highlands, have long dominated the country's politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, a large Muslim population living in the lowlands.
But this is changing, too.
"The cooperation is deepening and we are coming under the same umbrella", says Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest protests have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharic and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by a tiger tribe that represents only about six percent of the population but controls the military, intelligence, commerce, and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Meles was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at spotting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors to mediate between adversaries.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct", says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' shoes from near obscurity.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he's not trusted by the security forces run by the tiger tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, when thousands demonstrated against an election that analysts say was first disrupted and then stolen by the government.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although the death toll was lower than in previous months and the unrest ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, including the new tailor-made train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it has clearly not prevented internal resentment against the Ethiopian government from growing.
And the anger is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the Amhara city of Gondar, protesters attacked tiger-owned businesses, and anti-tiger hate speech is spreading on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a precarious position.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor neighboring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed, according to the US.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in the already volatile region to collapse.
"This requires a strict balance", says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic in calling Obama the founder of ISIS .
Donald J. Trump tried to retract his words on Friday in the latest controversy of his campaign by claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly this week claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to deliver a clear message to the people of his country.
It is also embarrassing for his supporters, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy times and explain comments he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at a campaign rally on Wednesday night and repeated in interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
However, early Friday morning, Trump tweeted that his statement was sarcastic.
Trump tweeted a complete twist on his speech from the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was very serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his argument by saying that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest storm of criticism came as Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy as his approval ratings plummeted.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy keynote address in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he thought Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
In late July, he drew widespread criticism for appearing to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email, later explaining his comments by saying, "Of course I was being sarcastic".
This is how Trump pushes the boundaries of political speech and retracts his words when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing out messages that are going to be resonant with his supporters, seeing how supporters respond to messages and then 'clarifying' one way or another depending on the response", says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has studied the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his arguments and knows they are round enough to pass through the various filters".
Instead of softening his rhetoric to the election crowd, Trump has changed his style even more dramatically in recent days as his approval ratings have continued to decline.
A new poll released Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist showed that Trump's approval ratings are significantly lower than Clinton's in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida is fairly evenly matched.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after increasing scrutiny in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, where they are forced to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, vigorously defended the presidential candidate in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I think what he said is justified, political", Giuliani said when asked if Trump was truthful in saying that Obama and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little little unknown organization that Obama called, quite wrongly, a 'lower-level team,' and that's because he pulled his troops out of Iraq".
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to continue its activities when it failed to deal decisively with the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, accusing them of trashing his speeches and discriminating against him.
He mocked "unworthy and pathetic" television commentators who try to find out about him but who, he said, cannot succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, saying it only made it more clear that he was not fit to be president.
A cafe closed due to unfair rent increases opens in Greenpoint .
The Verb Cafe was a bit of a seedy coffee shop in Williamsburg, with cash only and no Wi-Fi, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its street corner location on Bedford Avenue when the rent rose too high.
Replacing Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals find this middle-class man who has to avoid the cafe to lose it pathetic.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB Club is gone, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and the Verb is now a soap shop".
But even though New York may not be the same, it's also being created.
Last November, the Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi and credit card access, but some of the staff are the same and the atmosphere is still uncultured.
The coffee is still good, too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb Cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same vendor as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
It even re-enabled the old Verbi lamps.
Rodriguez says that he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
Bacon, chicken, egg and cheese sandwiches, and fillings of capers and browned onion rings are available.
There's also a list of black rice bowls.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but instead, fresh fruit juices.
After running the cafe for nine months, Rodriguez says that he noticed that old regulars began to come to Verb in a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg", he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited the cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and was a regular at Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, she still took walks to the Verbe, then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he said he stopped doing coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture", he says.
Now he is drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he had a chai-tea blend, also new on the menu, instead of his usual iced coffee.
Another longtime customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He used to go to the coffee shop before work and always order the same thing.
"I walked into the cafe every day at a quarter past seven, like a machine, and they were already making my bagel with all the fillings", he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies his bagels with bacon, chicken egg, and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge that the soap shop took over the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap that is made from Verbe's own cold brew coffee.
"We may still get the offer", says Rodriguez.
The coffee was also welcomed by the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says that he will find a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
There's a local juice company that wants to bottle and sell the coffee that's in the cafe.
The cafe may also expand into the adjacent building.
But for many customers, the new Verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says he was heartbroken when the cafe closed.
Whitt says that when the new place opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like coming home.
"I needed the smell of coffee".
The sad food of the Great Depression in a new book, A Square Meal.
In March 1933, shortly after his inauguration, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting at lunch in his office at the White House.
President Roosevelt, a noted culinary expert, enjoyed the luxury of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as goose liver patties and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, her menu was more modest: Devil's eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was a show of culinary solidarity for people who were suffering", says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat".
A couple in Brooklyn Heights work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, is about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of a tenement house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaborative work, published by Harper and due out Tuesday, is A Square Meal, a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity by arranging a meeting place with the reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, casual lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper that opened the same year as the Great Stock Market Crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, ordered a turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple said it was appropriate for a discussion about eating during the Great Depression.
"The berries were very popular", says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut butter, liver butter and bean butter.
They were made of materials that were cheap and contentious.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to feed your whole meal".
Andrew Coe is grinning.
"It must have been weighing on your stomach like lead", he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, operated on the principle of the "eat all you want" buffet.
The women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which people survived when abundance was suddenly rushed to abandon.
"This was a time when food became the central and most pressing topic of conversation in America", says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: According to Ziegelman, mysterious foods like muffins and patties became staples, and patties were called "a powerful way to harness the nutrients" because cooks could cover less tempting ingredients with whipped cream.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had for years been a staple of the American diet, became a sparingly consumed luxury.
They tried strange blends where the focus was on calorie and nutritional content rather than taste or even common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared baked onions filled with peanut butter, which were used as a shortage food.
"It was not popular at the dinner table", says Coe, who
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion are completely incompatible.
This was a feature of many household recipes".
Household economists, such as Louise Stanley, who was head of the Federal Housing Administration from 1923 to 1943, guided the dietary habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be careful budgeters and to respond to the challenge of making tasty dishes from peppers, such as carrot-and-cream noodles.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic delicacies.
Especially tasty are accounts of government reactions to its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While he publicly praised his childhood simple food on an Iowa farm, he himself ate like the millionaire and refined gentleman he had become.
"She liked continental European cuisine, like fish and gravy", says Coe.
"He ate in a dining room almost gold-plated, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality".
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book relates, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring, but also the worst prepared in Washington".
Many of the foods of the Depression were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in the way we pay attention to calories and nutrition and the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple report that as they wrote the book, they began to understand better Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of having to throw out the food", says Coe.
"People even started to feel sick from his food", recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, one time, I was in a windshield.
After the main course was emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out their homemade plum pudding, the same one President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam", says Ziegelman, adding that giving a showy name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly dipped our spoons in a thick brown puddle.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste that bad.
Coe danced a second time, and a third time.
"German nuts would make this better", Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budgeter.
Gilead was awarded full compensation for attorneys' fees in a patent dispute with Merck over a hepatitis C drug.
A United States District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full compensation for legal fees incurred in a patent dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc. concerning the hepatitis C drug.
Gilead was acquitted in June of $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents on Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni breakthrough drugs, which a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of violations that included perjury and other unethical practices.
In a complaint filed Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says Gilead was entitled to exemption from legal fees it received for defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for next-generation hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for proprietary rights to the laboratory-derived sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed forces have captured the city of Manbij from ISIS.
US-backed forces have taken over the town of Manjib in northern Syria near the Turkish border as the last ISIS fighters withdrew from the city, a spokesman for the forces said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now scouring the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the SDF-affiliated Manbij Military Council, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages held by ISIS fighters had been released.
"We now have full control of the city, but we are still conducting search operations", Darwish said.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of their federal income tax.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which shows that she and her husband had an income of $10.75 million at the time and that they paid a real federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reported earning $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton released their 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the example for financial transparency", said Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmer in a statement.
The exact opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and backs down on promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to disclose their tax information even if they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed the tax audit, citing it as the reason Trump has not released his income statements.
"The move is yours", Clinton campaign aide Ian Sam tweeted, referring to the tax records of Democratic candidate Sam.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump release his tax returns until the audits were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican lawmakers, have said that his refusal to release information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his donations to charity, business ties and many other ties, including ties to Russia.
Clinton has taken up the issue, posting a video online Friday that highlights prominent Republicans pressuring Trump to release their tax returns.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump is refusing to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, not to release his tax returns", Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump paid no taxes or only a little over two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted several tax lawyers and auditors as saying the situation could remain the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those making more than a million dollars a year pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama is also in favor of the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton campaign rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway is headquartered in the same city, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax information.
Buffet says he's also been under scrutiny by the IRS and that Trump is not afraid of the IRS, he's afraid of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been releasing tax returns since 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of their actual federal income tax between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was earnings from wages.
Their main investment was a low-yield index fund, and the Clintons reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Lightning condoms filled with chili powder in support of elephant conservation in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have devised an unusual way to keep elephants out of the vicinity of human habitation.
The technique has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has joined forces with the U.S. Nature Conservancy to launch a campaign to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and crops without harming elephants.
Not long ago, spears were used to scare elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"We have seen a change in attitudes in these villages since the development of the method, as villagers can now trust that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them", says Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
The first elephant to enter the area is alerted by pointing at it with a flashlight and blowing a horn.
If this doesn't work, we throw in what we call a chili cloud.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed in the condom along with the lightning rod, and then the end of the condom is closed so that only the spark plug is left outside.
When the spark plug is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually, one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
The final resort is a projectile that fires a firework known as a Roman candle into the air, producing a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli number plate at Arab "encouragement"  RT News
A French-born Jewish filmmaker sparked a media frenzy after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's country code in its country code.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel's address book.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which direct calls from the room could be made.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed  as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann is writing.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked me to explain the situation at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that he was shocked by the receptionist's response.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels".
The reason for the action made the film director even more shocked.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our visitors are Arabs, and they are demanding that the Israeli number be removed".
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by the Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the case "a great shame".
"This case is shocking and shocking to all of us.
It's a great shame.
And it is all the more shameful when we consider that we are in Germany and this particular hotel chain is at stake.
That's all I need to know.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions", says the Ambassador.
The case caused quite a backlash online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the demands of alleged Arab customers.
"Shame on you", said a publication that highlighted the hotel's location near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel quickly denied the allegations, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"A direct order to remove Israel from the numbered list was never given", says the Suddeutsche Zeitung, quoting a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the directional number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets at Brazilian student demonstration
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement tried to disperse the student crowd, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, expressing their dismay at the government's plans.
The governor of the state of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a cost-cutting measure that will see nearly 100 public schools closed and 300,000 students relocated.
Some protesters graffitied on the walls protesting against the temporary president Michel Temer.
The student demonstration came just days after the streets were filled with pro-Dilma Rousseff protesters as the Senate voted on impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 %  RT Business
Since the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has grown by 70.9 percent, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
He said that Russian companies' interest in doing business in Iran had increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
'Russian companies will continue their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further growth in trade is one of the primary objectives of cooperation between the countries", says Dzhagaryan.
The Commission notes that the Russian authorities have not provided any information on the alleged violations of the arms embargo.
"Russia's exports to Iran in particular rose rapidly by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons", says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian Embassy in Iran issued some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them for travel.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries by number of tourists whose citizens visited Russia.
And it is not too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken this year", he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz, and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he says.
Scot Callum Skinner has scored the winning goal as the British win the cycling gold.
Scotland's Callum Skinner made headlines in the men's team sprint at Rio Velodrome last night as the British trio defended their 2012 title in London.
Skinner, 23, of Glasgow, took on the role of anchor, inherited from his compatriot, Scottish skipper Sir Chris Hoyle, who made a legend proud by rushing for the goal and catching the winner against the heavily favored New Zealand team.
Britain took a surprise win four years ago when Hoy won her fifth of six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in London in March, even though Hoy had since retired from competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first tug.
Hindes came out just in time.
Hoey's decision to end the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner, the Scot, was a man the British coaches believed in and saw potential in, which he has now redeemed.
Hindes, with Hoy winning the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner set an Olympic record in the time trial, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in the doubles.
Hindes was trailing by a narrow margin after his round, but Kenny fought his way back to the team lead, which Skinner kept.
A big part of the change was changing the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down with a greater shift, which allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy was watching from his seat as a BBC commentator and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hinds as they stepped onto the trophy podium.
Says Skinner, 23, from Glasgow: "I'm flattered by the comparison.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world championship.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to beat it".
After winning the 2012 London Marathon, Hindes admitted, along with Kenny and Hoy, that he had fallen on the track deliberately due to a bad start.
He later retracted his words and the British competitors had no recourse.
This time, the sovereign victory was not associated with problems like this.
Says Hindes: "It was like London, with all the British flags flying in the stands.
Our team has grown together over the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great".
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the past five months, we have five successful days ahead on the Velodrome.
As Kenny has shown with his skills, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's achievements and winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would add six gold medals and one silver to Kenny's tally, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyt and was also born on 23 March (a magical date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
If he did, he'd have the same medal count as Hoyt.
Kenny's next race is the sprint, which starts today and ends in three days.
Kenny, 28, from Bolton, says: "Right now, I can only rejoice.
Team competition is always the best.
You're gonna enjoy the win with the guys.
Winning alone is a little lonely".
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
This was the only medal match of the day, but Britain had more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four-man team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012, for winning gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and final at 10:42 p.m. will be contested on the second day of the competition, and the focus will be on Wiggins.
He had a dispute with the race officials yesterday before the race, when the officials invited him to measure his height.
In the women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavi set the world record time of 4:13.260.
The British team can now count on its mighty track cycling team to take charge of the mid-Olympics and bring home a slew of medals.
After the truly exceptional evidence from the leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been a number of dramas, not the least of which was the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and harassment, and the termination of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, the races on the first night at the velodrome show that Britain's already legendary reputation for reaching the top at the perfect moment is once again being realised.
The future of Portland smelter at stake due to termination of power contract
The future of the Portland, Victoria, aluminum smelter and the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power company that supplies the smelter with electricity announced that one of the plant's owners is terminating the supply contract and that all supply contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is a consequence of the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year to discontinue subsidies to keep the plant running.
The fixed, 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Alcoa's Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
The strike action could put up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs at risk.
The snowball effect may increase further, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to years of speculation about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and more recently by the price of production at the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity to the large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other smelter owners to also terminate their contracts.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina, with minority shares held by CITIC of China and Marubeni Corp of Japan.
AGL expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
The Commission notes that the AGL was not granted until the end of the investigation period.
The contracts are to be terminated for 12 months, ending in 2017.
The Commission notes that the AGL is not a publicly owned company.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of any aid measure in the form of State aid.
AGL says it has already devalued its contracts by $187 million in its books 'as a pre-emptive strike.'
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts 'does not affect Alcoa's ability to ... maintain the smelter or to secure the electricity supply to the smelter'.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect in November this year, although it has yet to clarify why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
In view of the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious in their estimates of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
AGL's chief operating officer, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
'If these plants withdraw from the market, this will mean a significant drop in demand on the (electricity) market.
For us as producers, that would not be good news", says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian reality star Kendall is set to be the cover girl for September's Vogue.
Kardashian-Jenner model and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris Kendall Jenner, 20, poses for the September issue of American Vogue.
Kendall, who is the advertising face of Estee Lauder and has appeared at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the car in a room full of my loved ones brought tears to my eyes", Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or maybe just Kardashian-style?), scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar freaks Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest) pretending to forget their sister's cover.
The plot is clichéd and is used in almost all the birthday episodes of the soap operas (Seacrest says the words, "Did you think we forgot you?" as candidly as a children's morning TV cartoon), but Kris had to get the rest of his daughters involved in this publicity somehow.
Because appearing in the September issue of Vogue is undeniably the start of a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The number, which is more of a large picture book than a fashion magazine, attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion website Fashionista estimated that last year's 832-page issue had 615 pages of ads).
The September cover is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, the magazine's photos have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models for September included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more about celebrities who work as models than models who are celebrities.
Oscar-winning Dior ad personality Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as the model of success of her generation, and while she may be more of a celebrity model, she is in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities, real TV stars, or modern-day kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all of those things).
They can rightly be described as talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry beyond all others.
Beyoncé, who was featured on the cover last year, is coming off one of the strongest years of her career, when she released her album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
With her reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "sneakers".
These feelings have been rekindled after the news broke that Jenner was appearing on the cover of Vogue.
But the constant groaning of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She walks in Marc Jacobs's fashion shows.
She's the face of Estee Lauder cosmetics.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he took for Love magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, maybe just a way to meet her sister and her kids.
Legal aid centres turn away 160,000 people a year.
Each year, more than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people in the country are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact of additional cuts in funding on centres already operating at the frontier.
In Queensland, three out of five people seeking free legal aid and legal services are turned away, most of them elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices, and people without resources fighting against them.
Public legal aid services, already overburdened, are preparing for further cuts in funding.
Starting next June, legal aid centers are at risk of losing another 30 percent of federal funding.
According to James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, a recent report by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres shows that thousands of people are turned away from the centres each year.
If the federal government doesn't reverse its decision, Farrell says it's only going to get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are continually underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away when they seek essential services", says Farrell.
"People leaving violent relationships, people under uncontrollable and crippling debt, families breaking up, workers unjustly dismissed  all have problems with legal matters and this report shows that they are not able to get the help they need.
The federal government is planning to cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable people will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to withdraw these cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government kept its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
It is time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.'
Donald Trump 's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun .
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not taking any action after its leadership was told that the North Carolina campaign manager had threatened a worker with a gun while they were driving in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be addressed internally before he said he realized that was not going to happen.
In his lawsuit, Bordini says that campaign manager Earl Phillip "took out a gun, put his right thumb on the trigger and pressed a pipe into Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, after lodging a complaint with the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini was told that at least four other people had had the same experience as Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage", Bordini says in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused widespread outrage when he told a crowd in North Carolina that "second amendment supporters"  who are considered gun owners and gun owners  can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not, in fact, encourage violence.
In its complaint, Mr Bordini asks the campaign to pay compensation for negligence and Phillip for assault, battery and the emotional suffering they cause.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Despite their best efforts, Phillip was never found.
Charlotte's local news outlet, WCCB, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has had a controversial campaign.
The Commission has not received any information from the applicant concerning the alleged infringement.
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow is also a booster of the economy and a source of prosperity  not just for local communities and London but for the whole country.
For me, this was the thing that I was most interested in at Heathrow, and like the London Olympics in 2012, we invested tremendously in making sure that our entire nation and all our regions benefit from them.
The Olympics were a huge benefit to Stratford and the East End.
We're doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
We are creating 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs for local communities alone, eliminating youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As with the London 2012 Olympics, there will always be people who think that the expansion of Heathrow is too much of a challenge.
As for the Olympics, I was told that Britain would never be ready for them and that we would be in an awkward position in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to grow the economy by £211 billion, bringing skills and jobs to the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered on time and within budget an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, which included Terminal T5, which has been voted Airport of the Year for two years running, and Terminal T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they're ready to produce a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be.
It is time we used the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can secure the future of our trade and create skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of Heathrow's board and former commercial secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in a game of cat and mouse ad blocking
The efforts of online advertising companies to mislead ad blocker software have become a cat-and-mouse game, says one ad blocker company.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its website that it was blocking ad blocking, Adblock Plus published a blog post announcing that users can update their ad blocking filters to block ads on the social service again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the ad tag codes on its desktop site to make it harder for ad blocker software to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says they've cracked the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of bullfighting between the open source ad blocker community and the deceivers has been going on since ad blocker was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own corrective move.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how much of a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study by PageFair and Adobe last year, an estimated 200 million people worldwide use ad blocking software, a number that has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook has 1.03 million daily active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to focus on the deception of ad blocking software in its desktop application, as the spokesperson said that mobile ad blocking software does not work on Facebook's mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenue generated by desktop advertising is still sufficiently high, which is why Facebook considered the investment to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it would update its advertising tool in user settings to give users more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, saying they also block some regular Facebook posts.
"This is not a good user experience and we intend to fix the problem", a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
"Ad blocking programs are clumsy and ineffective, so we have instead invested in developing user settings like advertising tools so that people can control their targeting".
A woman committed suicide by getting run over by cars on a Swiss highway .
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses to assist in the investigation into a crash on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in which a woman was deliberately run over by several vehicles.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud, near Morges, shortly after midnight.
The woman committed her desperate act by lying on a dark road and was hit by several cars, police in Vaud said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, clearly attempting suicide, and a truck was among the cars that were overtaken.
The woman died at the scene.
Police say many of the drivers involved in the accident have been interviewed, but some are still unidentified, and they are asking them or other witnesses to come forward.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told the newspaper Le Tribune de Genève that a criminal investigation had been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
"Was the collision impossible to avoid?
That is for the prosecutor to decide", says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases where motorists are not held liable.
According to the newspaper, in both cases the person was walking on a dark highway and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to bump into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was acquitted of charges brought against him for the death sentence after he hit a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had drunk heavily and passed out on the road.
The court found that the driving of the police officer  responding to the distress call  was justified and that the man lying in the road was in "a completely exceptional and unforeseen situation".
Anyone with information about the accident that occurred near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA 's climate model says Venus has been habitable for a long time .
According to a new NASA climate model, Venus may have been habitable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model that allows scientists to study the past of Venus with the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions on Venus could have once been similar to those on Earth, even though the surface of Venus is hot and dry and its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
Previously, scientists had suggested that Venus' slow rotation was due to its thick atmosphere of gas.
However, the latest simulations suggest that Venus has had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and has nevertheless rotated slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early surface composition of Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but it may have had enough water and geographic diversity to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent fainter.
"The GISS model shows Venus rotating slowly and having a daytime of almost two months at a time relative to the sun", says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that act as an umbrella and protect the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is even a few degrees below the present temperature of the Earth.
The model was used to create a story of Venus that matches the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been habitable, it has been subjected to extreme heat and ultraviolet light for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the evaporated water.
The hydrogen karat left only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and the deadly greenhouse effect.
The researchers reported the results of a new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is stepping down as head coach of the Avalanche .
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from his duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado vice president/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the team will begin its immediate search for a new head coach.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with vigor, passion and determination", says Roy, 50.
"I have spent the summer thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach and the vice-president of hockey operations of the club must be on the same page as the organisation.
He also has to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.'
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision", Sakic says.
"We are grateful for all that he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future".
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's Coach of the Year in his first season as head coach of the Avalanche in 2013-14.
Under his leadership, the team scored 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made the postseason in the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 record in 2015-16, five points behind the Minnesota Wild in the second-place Wild Card game in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend strike
The main negotiators say the strike by the North Sea oil workers will be suspended when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been held against the Wood Group, an oilfield services company, on drilling rigs in the North Sea, owned by Royal Dutch Shell.
The parties' joint statement stated that 'The Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreement to reopen the process to resolve the dispute'.
We are also in favour of the introduction of a European system of taxation for the benefit of the workers.
The trade unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible cuts of up to 30 percent in wages.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut its tariffs for its contractors in the North Sea by around 9% this year.
The company's tariff reduction is in line with the 10% reduction in prices for contractors working in the country in 20114.
The company claims that the additional cuts will give it the necessary flexibility to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to exit oil and gas drilling in up to 10 countries as it seeks to step up its operations following its mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in the North Sea in a generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the Mediterranean and across the country, we need an economy that benefits the many, not just the few", says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to cost less than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared with about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the rotation of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list yet of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades.
With the new information, astronomers will be able to understand why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how rotation times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between the star's mass and age and even the history of its solar system", says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, California.
The Pleiades are a group of stars located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching adulthood.
They're spinning faster than ever.
At the peak of their rotation, the adult stars eject a large amount of stellar wind.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they pass through their magnetic fields.
As the star ages, its rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of identifiable star spots (which are similar to sunspots).
The latest rotation rates listed suggest that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull likens stars to dancers. Larger ones spin more slowly than smaller ones.
"We see from the Pleiadian 'dance' that slow-spinning stars are typically larger, while fastest-spinning stars are typically very light", says Rebull.
Because of its proximity, the Pleiades constellation serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars relative to their rotational velocities.
"The Pleiades constellation provides a backbone for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars", says Rebull.
We still want to know much more about how, when, and why stars slow down and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades in three new papers to be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
