The Prague Stock Exchange had a negative crash at the close of the market.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered losses.
Transactions in CEZ shares accounted for almost half of the daily trading volume.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the day before, which was almost 6%.
Behind this downturn is the Wall Street stock market crash.
We also see a reaction from the market to the vote in the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilise the local financial sector.
Shares in Asia Crash
On Tuesday, Asian stock markets fell dramatically, although the indices later cleared some of the losses.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost almost 4% during the day, but then also lost some of its losses, stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks Chinese equities on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8% while Shanghai markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5 percent, but eventually the loss was 4.3 percent.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, has dropped by 3.6%.
"The timing of the bailout is uncertain and this will affect financial markets worldwide", noted the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, manages its own financial policy, thus independent of the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates on par with the United States.
The US lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the financial support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries may be affected.
The impact of the American stock market
The US Parliament on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, which was to be allocated $700 billion (nearly 12 billion Czech crowns).
Lawmakers thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
The Bush plan, he said, would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a tailspin on Monday, and major stock indexes recorded their biggest drop in more than two decades.
The Dow Jones fell by almost 7% and a similar drop was last seen in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has caved in: the US government can give $700 billion to the banks.
The highest representatives of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on economic support for the US financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the bailout plan in the form of financial aid for the US financial system totalling $700 million (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not said yet.
Representatives in Congress must therefore define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be debated on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
That was what the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters on Sunday.
The Senate, according to some sources, may vote on the plan, probably not until Monday.
The announcement of the financial plan's approval should be the first and most important psychological factor in the financial markets' awakening.
But then we will have to return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, we can get the help of the markets.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great step forward".
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the market stabilization package", Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Legislators met Saturday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government's financials.
These funds should be used to acquire from financial companies the non-transferable mortgage assets, which lead financial companies to serious losses and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market".
"We still need to carry out the recovery plan, but I think we are there", said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Sign
The global financial crisis is having a major impact on stock markets, which are plunging sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are thus trying to reach a final agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in the order of time, the first to affect the market on Monday following the decision of the Congress.
But it is not yet clear when the two houses of the US Congress will vote on the law and even if the negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some issues.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount of support for the scheme must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion needs to be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush has called for.
But Congress can block the rest of the money if it feels the program is not doing its job, blocking the next $100 billion and then the final $350.
Bush has welcomed the progress in the negotiations.
Even though the president can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program has remained the same, which is to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage securities, whose price has collapsed because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", as the Republican senator mentioned.
President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with the positive developments on Saturday and appreciated "the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restrictions on gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that the legislators have agreed on responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closing of the budget cuts, the splitting of the financial plan.
The new law also aims to limit so-called golden parachutes for corporate executives participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and have made a big step forward towards an agreement that will work and will be good for the market and also for all Americans", said Mr Paulson.
The plan is to help homeowners who have trouble making payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates it will buy with the aim of lowering the monthly interest charges for borrowers and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because we do not know how and at what price the problematic assets will be bought up by the
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will share the losses", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, that crucial.
"Much more important, congressional representatives should reach agreement this week on support for this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement being approved is now more important", Marek stressed.
MP3 players versus cell phones
We will advise you on how to choose
While almost any cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can telephony.
It's clear from this that it's better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons for acquiring a self-reading machine.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the requirements of the future owner.
You may not buy a high-quality expensive record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP's and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
But if you find hard-rock, jazz, or blues records on your shelves, you probably dream of such a turntable.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for some to spend 8,000 kroner on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan may have a hard time digesting the 20 kroner headphones on the market.
Two extremes between which there's enough room for everyone.
There's a lot to choose from.
It's the battery life that counts.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but that's something that cell phones don't do even by accident.
There is no other modern device that is as universal as the mobile phone.
Along with the primary functions, calling and texting, it can read music and video, record both, and it has a camera, sometimes better, sometimes worse, and maybe even browsing.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds, you'll also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle because no refrigerator can make a grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the screen will require charging.
And reading music takes up a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can play music for more than 12 hours, usually, and much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simpler ones) are much more effective.
As for the cheap phones, don't count on them lasting more than a few hours.
If you add to this, from time to time, a few calls, get another battery charger at work for safety, this applies even to the most expensive appliances.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least nine hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when downloading music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do so without an adapter for the minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
The readers, with a few exceptions (iPods), do not require any special software.
Just fill the unit with music via USB from the computer.
Most cell phones and readers create a multimedia library of their own, sorted by artist name, album name, genre or user rating.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of the folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, cell phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you should be especially concerned with its battery life, memory capacity, sound quality and type of output, and, of course, ease of use.
If you need music mainly in the background and you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you just need an ordinary MP3 reader mobile phone.
Now, that's possible, obviously, with any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what formats the phone or the reader recognizes.
MP3 players support all of them, so the majority of the music that comes to you globally will be in that format.
In addition to this format, which is among the most common, the vast majority of devices support music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is missing.
The best cell phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the corresponding pages of the mobile operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could be a valid argument for buying a mobile phone-reader.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is meager and is usually limited to the radio's one-hit wonder.
The prices are not exactly cheap.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (whether via GSM, the internet or the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them all the time.
Anyone who comes to listen to something goes into their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on whether you're always wearing your headphones or at least your wireless headphones.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small fraction of MP3 players, have.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of reader-mobiles will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
For three or four thousand crowns you can buy a very decent Walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of a common headphone input.
The best and technically most equipped mobile phones, and also with the 3.5 mm jack for common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand kroner.
The advantage of the readers is, among other things, the ease of handling.
The simpler ones are not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) but they are really handy for anyone to handle.
The minimal functions, the similarity of the handling to the common stereo or perhaps the record player, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start of the mobile Internet network and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example Vodafone 527) have as a rule a slot for interchangeable memory cards (of the type M2, microSD etc.).
The purchase of the corresponding card is also included in the 2 000 kroner.
But be careful.
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the high-end ones can handle 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, get Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you should not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, you should take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keyboards and the convenience of the service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson has come a long way in this area, with its Walkman line of mobile phones having the same range of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above brands offer the same service and the same price range up to 4 000 kroner, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, usually up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will be in the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe you should .
The Czech mobile phone market is perhaps quite mature and our operators offer virtually all the services of their Western European counterparts.
However, something is missing here - a virtual operator that forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be gone for long.
We have written many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was eventually confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in the Czech Republic than in the rest of the Union.
The latest steps by the European Commission in the field of regularizing roaming charges may create a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS abroad will cost less than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to start the fight.
It may sound absurd, but we also have three mobile networks here and coverage well over 100 percent.
The mobile phone operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is also often emphasized by the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who has sometimes in the past expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his own network probably no longer has many possibilities (otherwise it would perhaps be difficult to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the market has led to a significant price reduction, to which the traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, there were similar voices in Britain as there are here.
But it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be really successful.
We must not go too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator has managed to gain more than 100 000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, to which Ufon belongs in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrating on a much more concrete target group.
In other words, they require far fewer customers than a traditional operator to be able to operate effectively.
They do not have to bear relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world, virtual operators are usually low-cost, they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the more restricted offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half the cost of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move to bet on a target group.
This operator is targeting men specifically, so to speak.
"Real men choose Mobilking as a carrier that they like and can trust", says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual carrier.
It is difficult to say whether we can claim a similar concept as in Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, which most virtual operators rely on.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of services.
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever going to be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
'There is talk of expanding this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area", Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the Penta financial group, told Mobile.cz in a telephone conversation.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very supportive of this thinking.
On the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor is created.
The GTS Novera group has been making no secret of its interest in launching a virtual operator for some time, as it would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them", says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
So maybe there will be better times to come.
The first virtual operator is expected to be available by the end of the year.
For now, however, an impenetrable wall of silence surrounds his creation.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far, no one with a complex and serious project has approached us", said Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónika O2's press section in a statement to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in a rare nod to the O2 statement: "We have not noticed any viable and mutually beneficial commercial projects that we can continue to build on".
He adds: "A virtual operator is unlikely to appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
We would have had to have a concrete agreement on the table by now, so that we could consider it on the horizon".
Vodafone focuses instead on meeting its 3G licence requirements.
"We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the field of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider that, from the customer's point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a joint network for high-speed mobile internet".
The competent authorities - with the operators involved
The attitude of the mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to lower profits.
So why facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The troubles surrounding the creation of U:fon testify that when operators care about something they know how to row from the same side.
Perhaps the pressure was high against ČTÚ at the time of the creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on the ČTÚ web pages.
But now U:fon itself serves as an argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: 'The competitive environment in the mobile telephony market has been recently enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on it and above all on its services.'
The attitude of mobile operators is, however, surprisingly lacking in any interest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just the attitude of the CTU which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere with economic competition.
The Commission has also been asked to provide information on the implementation of the new competition rules.
But this has taken its typical position on the whole issue.
'The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer from potential buyers has probably not been attractive enough for traditional operators", said Kristián Chalupa from the external relations section of ÚOHS in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
But from the office that has to protect the interests of consumers and also take care that nobody takes advantage of their position on the market, it is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside the country where virtual operators are common, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services".
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices are not in the interests of ÚOHS.
What is really shocking in the whole situation is the almost thrilling harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
The same price for all petrol is the result of coincidence and competition.
'The Section has found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position and therefore no corresponding increased responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The telecommunications regulator may also be lacking the necessary tools to open up the mobile network market to virtual operators", Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of the many points of controversy.
There is, of course, the analysis of relevant markets by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different approach - the agreement of the network operator is always required for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has - after all - a monopoly on its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant.
But even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a bit alarming for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are proceeding in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, the complaints from the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during the negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Delegating responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly common trick by which ÚOHS keeps itself out of the whole thing.
We have seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not promoted until the recently passed updating of the Telecommunications Act, despite the fact that many experts expected this to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must be well aware of this, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
You can do it when no one's looking
But what we don't notice is the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of which even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies which publish their price lists for mobile telephone services which are only partially public.
These are usually companies that do multi-level marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the people who are pre-determined.
The magic lies in the fact that the company is a typical business customer, which orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, he receives special price offers (and other).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
'If the cases you mention occur, which we will look into, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and it could lead to the termination of cooperation with this company,' Martina Kemrová answered the question in question.
But it is unlikely that such activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile phone operators.
Especially in the cases of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
No operator can simultaneously defend himself against such an attitude.
In other words, they make a substantial profit from the activity of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real operators - they are not harmed in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot have full access to it like regular customers of mobile operators".
But this should be a little strange for the CTU.
In addition, another issue arises for the OHIM.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It should be added that the rights of the ÚOHS are strong enough to expose such activities and if they do not want to, they will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and whose commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we 're not expensive anymore
As has been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant reduction in the price of services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where operators were born, the traditional operators tried to prevent their creation in some way.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small market, too saturated border, problems with quality of service etc.
But in developed countries, it is precisely in these cases that regulatory bodies have intervened in defense not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both formal measures and informal pressure have led to the creation of the first virtual operator, and others have followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
In our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of competence in these cases is more than comforting.
But we're not giving up.
If the information behind the scenes is correct and the virtual operator will appear very soon, the Czech mobile phone market will be back on track.
If one of the operators had agreed to set up a virtual mobile operator alone, it is unlikely that ÚOHS would be immune to the rejection (discrimination) of the other operators concerned.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best One
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On the occasion of the Day of the recognition of the Czech State, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on Sunday solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available  solo with male or female voice, chorus step and the instrumental edition.
The choir is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn revisions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the website iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he has chosen specifically to sing the solo variants, the singers with the most representative young voices, who are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to make sure that both of them, and the choir, had clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they were in harmony", he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh theatre in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
It has gained popularity and people have spontaneously taken it over.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "New" Hymn Sounded
The MHD in Prague will accompany you for the first time with an electronic ID card.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, tram and bus instead of the paper ticket with an electronic card in their pocket.
Right now , there are about 100,000 people who have their own Opencard card that can get it .
Passengers can buy the 30-day and 90-day annual cards (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoint and at the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stops Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The vouchers can be bought from yesterday on the Internet at the Transport Company's website www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers had used the service by this afternoon.
Those who start using the service via the Internet can completely forget about the counters at the metro stops where they used to have to wait in long lines for paper tickets.
The cut-out is purchased via the Internet and is recharged on the Opencard at one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a counter with trained staff who will help them with their online purchases and will also record the credit on their card", said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition, in libraries, it will be possible to upload the electronic vouchers to the Opencard ATMs and self-service machines installed at the entrances to the metro.
What are these ATMs like?
They are red, resembling ticket erasers, and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty", concluded Opatrný.
The cash register will be checked by the driver instead of the ATM.
The ATM service that will be operational from tomorrow is very simple.
Just enter your Opencard and once you've paid the coupon, it'll load.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is to say, on the city lines of trains and buses numbered 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
'In the trains added to Prague's integrated transport, there are controllers with card readers to check the validity of the time and zone,' explained the way in which tickets are checked by Filip from the organisation Ropid, which fixes the timetables of Prague's public transport.
City buses have card readers integrated into the driver's cab.
During the ascent, it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the card, but also to put the Opencard at the designated point next to the cash register.
The driver checks the validity of the coupons loaded.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information", Drápal added.
Passengers who take city buses and will not remember, when the validity of the coupon expires, can go back to the self-service ATMs, where the coupons are loaded on the card.
Here, information on the validity of their documents will be displayed on the screen of the device.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the U.S.
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is shown by the letter deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States.
With this wish, it is said, that groups of Sudeten Germans appealed to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is further evidenced by a letter preserved in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans in Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Šumava district"  occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that the American units will arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", the letter signed with the words "People who care about the fate of Šumava with all their heart" reads.
Because, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia - knowing the Czech national character - gives the Germans of the Sudeten only hope for brutality, lack of concern, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter beg the American president to assume the protectorate over Šumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, nothing at all, to the victory of the Allies", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president should doubt the conviction of the Germans of Šumava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or live under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of postwar history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans had the slightest inkling that this would involve their moving from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudetenland.
Others thought they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a Budějovice German in the Baltic Sea naval power.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and put in a prison camp in Holštýn, dozens of other Czech Germans came to visit him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would be of use to them", Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, counted on the fact that on the basis of Beneš's decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think you'll pay for it!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history directed at road safety.
That's another way to describe the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that this will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will be shown on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and even in leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol.
And remind him to put his seat belt on before he leaves.
It wants to raise awareness among young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least among professional drivers.
What's going to be in the commercials?
Mostly stories about people that will affect the emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think - you'll pay for it!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you will pay".
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The commercials will "scar" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of the victims of accidents are commonly seen.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with the red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or an accident.
Drivers need to be reminded of the risk", says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the hospital Na Homolce.
And that's why we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative publicity, the psychologist believes.
He believes that the warning signs that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning sign is installed, it will probably soon blend in with the environment and drive unattended", warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Israeli interim government, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordanian border, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue published Monday, the Jedi daily Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all of the (occupied) areas, if not all of them", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the same percentage (of Israeli areas) to the Palestinians, because without this there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would include East Jerusalem .
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the bulldozers or the sweepers to go over him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted in reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the premier, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places", which are inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he added.
The Golan Heights withdrawal
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was a prerequisite for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose concluding peace with Syria on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan alone", he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up their permanent support for the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Is stewarding on the buses illegal?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the bus that makes long distance trips
The question of whether stewards and passengers can move around on the bus during the journey has been raised in the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the coach of the Student Agency company.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the traffic law", says the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week in which a 22-year-old flight attendant was killed was caused by a truck that cut off the bus.
The girl was unfortunately seated next to the driver in the most unsafe part of the bus, although there were still two seats available.
But the bus can crash or brake suddenly even when it is distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus has standing places according to the booklet.
If it's not approved, passengers must sit.
The buses of the Student Agency have no stopping places, the company's director Radim Jančura confirmed to Aktuálnĕ.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry and initially it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
It was later revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the journey if they have their assigned seats", he said.
The law doesn't recognize a steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward  no law deals with the regularization of this role".
However, there is no provision that prohibits the carrier from providing the services.
The law on road traffic only recognises the term 'carrier' and its rights and duties are not defined", added Hanzelka, who spoke less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law is sufficient to solve this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing positions.
That's it", he says.
It categorizes buses into urban buses with standing seats and maximum speed limits, intercity buses with standing seats with higher maximum speed limits and long-distance buses without standing seats with maximum speed limits and seats with safety belts.
Like flying, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet flight there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
It's not safe there either when turbulence comes and the flight attendant can bump her head".
"If the bus brakes abruptly, the laws of physics obviously apply.
Just like on the city bus or the tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of the stewards by means of an internal regulation,' he says, and he also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering the services of stewards.
This one employs about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director still thinks their job is dangerous.
"As soon as I feel I must consider the steward profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
It would also reduce costs", he says.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines of the Student Agency, has cited the absence of stewards on his vehicles as a safety concern.
"We have no hostess, we've been opposed to it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
And then there was a huge tragedy.
The accident on the Naples line killed a young hostess from the Plzeň region who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably went out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid him with a sharp maneuver, but he hit him with the right front end.
Jančura denies that the two reserved seats at the stewart's rest were occupied.
"You can't book these seats on long-distance buses, they're unsealable".
The company is planning to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court's decision to pay damages to the girl's family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The law review?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, which has been worked on by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport for more than a year, could lead to the clarification of the movement of the stewards on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results though.
They don't think about buses as much, they think more about the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers", concludes the spokesman Havelka, who points out that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf are in Frankfurt
The words of the WestLB director's letter to the employees of the company are not lacking.
In the letter published on Monday it was stated that "the capital market centre of the savings bank financial group" could be formed through the merger of the Düsseldorf banking institution with Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
WestLB would launch a 'competent block' with durable profits in such a venture.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and Parliament.
That's how it's read when a board of directors in a tough time wants to show it's got a handle on things.
Because the distressed WestLB is still under a lot of pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the National Financial Supervisory Service, having pointed out to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia a long time ago that time is running out in the search for a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the savings banks' clients themselves already know because of their investment funds, and WestLB have certainly been discussed for quite some time, even by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, Deka-Bank's head, Franz Waas, said at the presentation of the first half-year's turnover that a merger of the house in via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB would be pointless.
However, the Deka board of directors, which is half-owned by the regional banks and savings bank consortiums, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint contracts.
This could be market transactions or parts thereof.
But the talks have, as they say in the business world, just begun.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important companies in the business district of Frankfurt, and it is not the first time that it is mentioned when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it seemed for a short time that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This three-way partnership was not pursued.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Hesse was against Helaba's participation.
The other two institutes also proved incapable of reaching an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet it has often been considered for a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But eventually Günther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Apart from that, it seems that there is a growing awareness that the different public sector bodies need to get closer together.
Since the elections to the Bavarian Parliament have taken place, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank and the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank may take place first.
It's not all good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for more mergers increases, we'll be short of partners.
In the South, we'd have a junior partner now, although so far he's outgrowing the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The savings bank association Assia-Thuringia, which holds 85% of Helaba, has put an end to the meeting with WestLB.
It would only be NordLB
These geo-strategic considerations are just one account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, which business model would secure the future of the regional banks, was not yet answered by the association of German savings banks.
The West LB division could also come about eventually, which is of course not desired by the West LB.
The letter from the Management Board thus expresses the will to strive in any case for a 'general solution'.
We'll see how the merger of the individual parts with Deka-Bank works out.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or fourth time.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so says that everything is different.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser's 5-liter barrel, stands a bearded man and shows the approximately 200 travelers what deep tones he can produce from his throat.
Elena first gives Luca a slap and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus station next to the Porta Nuova station, four couriers leave tonight at 11:45 p.m. for Monaco, Beer Festival.
Three of the couriers are reserved for Italians, and in another, only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, Marco says, that it's not for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with false fur lining and a pair of wide silver-striped glasses owns the buses.
They've been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year.
The night trip, the day trip to the party, the return trip at 10:30.
Spending the night would only create unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian standards of authenticity, the sickness fund and the German guide. Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for Brennero.
We're still out of beer.
Suddenly, the bus is silent, and the passengers fall asleep.
Better that, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian-plated buses on the A9 highway before Munich make a short stop.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 a.m., as scheduled, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On the left side of the card, it says "Oktoberfest" next to the web address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the beer tent open, it means running!" quotes Marco from early morning.
"Run!" Run and take the seats at the end of the tent.
"Not in front, or we'll block, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, split into the adjacent space!"
The cup costs 8.25 euros, shouts Marco.
And don't forget to tip the guy.
"To show the security service that we behave!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "We will meet again here at 22:30 on the dot!
We're going to the party.
On the street, one attacks trees, street signs and even a billboard of a large Bavarian People's Party with his yellow caps.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the festival, known as "Italian Weekend".
Exact figures do not exist, it is said that 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police in Munich are reinforced with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical care ahead of the British (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
The Hofbräuhaus tent is especially beloved by Italians.
1. Sleepless nights for the creditors of the real estate hype
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word 'relative' and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started over the weekend.
The DAX-listed real estate lender Hypo Real Estate is getting a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday that the support credits would amount to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part you asked for.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
The state lender, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced itself in a very short time, which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had shrunk by 95% to EUR 2,37 million, and its equity ratio fell from EUR 1,6 to EUR 1,45.
Current income and net income from financial business had fallen to zero compared with the previous year, while earnings from both increases in demand and certain shares and the liquidation of provisions in loans fell by more than 70% on the 5 million euro figure.
Only thanks to higher revenues from the reimbursement of subordinated compensation costs, which come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest under the Single Text of the Tax Laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate at around 16%.
The former public lender after being privatised in 1990 had lost out on speculation in commercial real estate loans, which were incorporated into Aareal Bank.
Since the revenue from conventional state financing was too low, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private and state investors (PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write off the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is, the dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
Hypo Real Estate, after the absorption of Depfa, is a major financer of the State and of infrastructure.
It is more dependent on the interbank market than other institutions because it does not have customer deposits.
The collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago has largely dried up inter-bank lending, because banks are hoarding liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for a part of Depfa's loan portfolio of  about 50 billion  annually.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs were covered by credit for a certain period and the company was protected from the influx of the mostly non-functioning international money markets.
Other sources say that thanks to the money the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the board of HRE, Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE group will not need money markets in the short term.
The Bundesbank and the BaFin rely on the fact that the HRE Group is still marketable .
This is what is hoped for by the bank's shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be used in full.
But the opposite is also possible.
After the bank was reportedly on the verge of collapse on Sunday evening, the temporary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The stock price plunged 75% to 3.30 euros.
They're holding up pretty well on mortgage rates.
While the front-loaded debts are proving almost unmovable, the rates of the deferred debts are falling.
The mortgages of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are particularly affected, and understandably those with maturities after 2009.
HRE's mortgages, which previously seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now have to be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the intensification of the banking and financial crisis, which has been triggered by the Depfa crisis.
Until the central banks, governments and less damaged banks are ready, you can count on a write-off of the annuities by the deadline.
Or it is going to happen, which no one dares to hope will happen - that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But as for the information overturned because of the partial stateizations the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will create some sleepless nights for long-term investors, especially with the decision to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors may carry forward losses for future capital gains tax payments.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is supposed to report to Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Log of exchange narrates of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I was scared to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, on the way to Kawasaki, and it takes me 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, and luckily I didn't get lost.
The start of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as we have in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 a.m. onwards, until at 8:40 a.m. a brief interview with the teacher begins, the so-called "home room".
But before the class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to speak in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have my school uniform, I put on an old host mother's skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks, and black leather shoes.
I sat in front of the chair dressed like this and tried to pronounce "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana"... - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language two years earlier.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled and waved and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew this one from my manga.
It belongs to the Japanese girl's essential survival vocabulary and means "cute, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me giggled, because she thought it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student.
The rest of the class went on quietly, but when the gong sounded, I was attacked in the truest sense of the word.
They all spoke in a disorderly way and laughed and drilled me with questions. It's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Everyone opened their Bento during the break.
My host mother also made me a Lunch-Bake-A-Bake-A-Bake-A-Bake-A-Bake-A-Bake-A-Bake-Bake-A-Bake-Bake-Bake-A-Bake-A-Bake-Bake-A-Bake-Bake-A-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake-Bake, which is also called the German version of the game.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of meat and tofu rolls.
To be honest, I don't even know what I'm eating in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
The fact is, it's all really good.
Except maybe the plums in the salt, brrr!
Bento is not just a lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl will give a Bento of her own, prepared quite artistically, in the hope of then meeting the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm just curious if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
I've been reading manga for years.
And to understand comics and the culture that they contain, I eventually started to learn some Japanese.
I was totally convinced I was gonna go there.
I'm also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care about us here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I never feel lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life".
1. Rats have feelings too
A rat or a cockroach runs away when they sense danger.
Neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
4. But how could it be if, when they behave in our way, they have our feelings?
For some years now, the Internet journal "Edge" has been publishing articles by well-known scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question: "What do you believe is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case, we have to at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter into unworkable territory, because the reference frame doesn't match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do, which is it pretends to be dead, it runs away, or it attacks.
People behave in a similar way, which some scientists understand to be a comparable subjective feeling.
I can't believe this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often linked with human consciousness, the associated circuits (this because of its direct participation in short-term memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and among other creatures it seems to be completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, it is thus admittedly grounded in the assumption that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should be seen in the way man speaks: since a large part of life is connected with language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness is not dependent on language, it would affect it so that the animal's consciousness, as it is made, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
So it's hard to find out how consciousness might be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, to analyze it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will give us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
One could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
So by this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we move first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for implementing visualization.
What, then, is the outline for feelings?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or of its consequences, such as the body's reactions) occupies the working memory.
In this view, feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
With the speaking nature subtle nuances of feeling are created, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In contrast to this Antonio Damasio for example believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the regions of the body of the cortex sensations and the paleocephalus, similarly to Jack Pankseep, who however focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network hasn't changed much in human evolution, this could definitely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict this, but I consider it to be unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear probably feels that way to the senses in both cases: but how could it be verified that rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach in danger runs away as if he too feels fear?
In my eyes, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any vital similarity.
And that's why the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalans, cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the paleo-encephal system responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove that in humans, how would you prove that in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than emotional feelings in rats.
However, there is some progress here at the neural level, provided that we do not do the same procedure on rats and humans.
Just as I'm not researching language and consciousness in rats, I'm not researching their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually running into a wall.
I'm a practical emotional right now.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the Europeans with Poland", said Wasjunik
"This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both host countries are limping along the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of stadiums to be used for European football will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose any more time.
Now we have to work with maximum speed", said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will be keeping a constant eye on us".
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer".
Many of the top division players were convicted of manipulation last season alone, and the league was even postponed until the last minute.
Dennis Quaid responds with indignation
She wanted to promote a new movie, and in an interview she talked about her private life, and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared her ex Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
He foams with rage and retort.
The War of the Roses has been delayed for the former couple of husbands Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now fighting each other in a public brawl.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this was very painful".
The extent of the betrayals she would only know after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul stripping" was Ryan's work with the press for her new film "The Women"  tells the story of an adulterous man.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adulterous husband was a clear-cut: it would be "unheard of", the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg for the umpteenth time is repeating and reworking the story of our relationship".
It would also be "regrettable" if Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, was again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that separation means for every child".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and soon to be the father of twins.
And so his judgments end with the arrow: "My life, in any case, goes on.
I feel lucky to have a wonderful family who have everything going for them".
Prices for airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - a study by travel and financial provider American Express found.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter, it observed a clear decrease in the second quarter.
After rising hotel prices for years, accommodations in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed still rise by an average of around 6.9 compared with 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the reason for this as the weak dollar, which would lead to a "lack of travel by American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be hit by the hotel price downturn more than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city of Oslo, hotel prices have risen by 26.3%, setting a European record.
The trend in the first quarter was also upward for air fares:
Economy Class passengers paid 7.1% more on average than in 2007, and long-haul fuel-intensive flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, economy class airline ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5% compared with the previous quarter, although price changes were much weaker in first and business class.
In Germany prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11.9%, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
The study also found that prices for domestic German flights had been cut in half.
The company explains that the reason for the fall in prices is the decline in economic growth.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has declined.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe, would increase the pressure of competition.
The crisis was also reflected in the fact that airlines were no longer operating unprofitable routes and that a large number of airlines had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008. In Europe alone, 24 airlines had declared bankruptcy.
HSV beats Gladbach by 1 to 0.
With one goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the capital.
At Borussia Luhukay, he still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein makes the lucky landing for the national team player Marko Marin worse.
The Gladbach player first came in late and missed with a cross-bow .
His message was worded with precision, his lips were convincing.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal", Hermann Rieger shouted in the lobby of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the pause in the game was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for HSV for almost three decades, enjoying an even higher esteem than some of the old players.
And so his warning has found a hearing in the higher realms.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have played similarly: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Not everything here today was beautiful to see", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also "wanted to be more relaxed".
For the 1-0 victory, Hamburg must thank Mladen Petric's head-butt (11) and the fact that the very weak players in Gladbach could not harm the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty win", Martin Jol summed up.
The SV Hamburg will be 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators celebrated earlier, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the flashing leaderboard on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as first in class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"we are able to put everything back together", said Marcell Jansen.
He has the feeling that the provisional certificate from the table is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the defender of the door Petric as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern - slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more dribbling", Jol says forcefully.
After the defeat of the vote
Wall Street is running scared.
Early news of the bailout's failure has temporarily sent the Dow Jones down 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in its history.
Later the Down's got a little better again.
At about 8:30 p.m., the world's leading stock market barometer was trading at a good 5% below 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was flat with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which gave us just 14%, and Bank of America, which lost about 12%.
No title could do it .
Goldman Sachs' stock has fallen by just 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, the great investor Warren Buffett had joined the venture.
The rescue plan provided for the financial resources to be used to purchase the mortgage papers.
The sum is not to be paid in one lump sum, however, but in stages.
In the meantime the State had to keep the financial companies' Aktienoptionsscheine, which could be redeemed with an appropriate price development, in order to reduce the charge to the State's coffers.
The stock market in Europe and the USA in the downward spiral
The billions in aid to banks in Europe and the US do not remove the doubts of investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and tears the German stock index down
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red, despite the government's planned bailout of the financial markets.
The spectacular losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German stock market index into deep deficit.
The shares of the Munich real estate lender temporarily lost three quarters of their value despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank lost more than 20%.
The German stock market index DAX has slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% out of 5,839 points.
The world stock markets are on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout might not be enough to bring financial markets back to growth.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3% of 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The House of Representatives voted for the bailout, and the Senate voted on it on October 1st.
The other European stock exchanges have also been able to move in one direction only: in London the FTSE index has fallen by 3.2% for the time being, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Nikkei benchmark index after initial profits was 1.26% short of 11,743.61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index has slipped by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex stock index lost 506.43 points or 3.9%, and closed with 12,595.75 payers.
Arcandor's shares are down at MDax after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed new shares for the amount of 23 million .

Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled scientists: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe has flown through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that are rapidly freezing, she now faces death by freezing.
Scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon for years - the Swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is a spacecraft flight maneuver, whereby they gain additional momentum/push/swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical device as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has puzzled scientists for years is that rockets do not behave exactly as you would expect them to do under the law of gravity.
It's actually irregularities in the speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
The year they renamed it the Swing-by Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have observed in the cosmos.
"The cause of the anomaly may be dark matter that may be very close to the Earth", he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
Evidently, a force of attraction emanates from her, the effect of which on the other heavenly bodies is seen.
It is completely invisible, that is, it neither emits nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
Scientists calculate that dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the total mass of the cosmos.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In a gunfight before the release six kidnappers are reported to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The negotiations for the purchase are already underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic broadcaster Al-Arabiya and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after Italian television Sky TG 24 reported: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We are looking at their health", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are reported to be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the release of the hostages is still unclear: so the kidnappers, after the indications of an Egyptian public security agent, would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", the official said.
It was "still only a matter of taking the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday shot dead six of the kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany, which was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, referring to a German intermediary, that the release of the hostages would be delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intended to release the women after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe way out.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Stepfather's Abuse "led to Suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather have led to a woman's suicide, a court has ruled.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for six years after admitting to eight cases of sexual assault.
It was learned at Truro Crown Court that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note, "I feel responsible for his death".
It has come to the attention of the court that Miss Randle had committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise molested and bound her before having sex, while her mother was away working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court heard that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a long time volunteering with the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends of Ms. Randle, who had been a great surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and that she had "slipped out of life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his Plymouth apartment.
It's thought she killed herself by choking on a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended, "I bound and bandaged her".
"I did not sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more difficult is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up before the court".
I notice the effects Stephanie's father and mother describe having on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy young success".
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It's the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there's nothing to suggest criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They will have thought that this was handled internally at the Mod and Cabinet Office", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause that concerns safeguarding information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents that were lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the bill of B&B
British construction companies could face a bill of over £80,000 after the Bradford & Bingley bailout.
The government has given £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, managing director of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it was "irritating" that companies and their members had to pay.
The £14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that figure.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved cautiously are now being called upon to pay a part of the bill for those institutions that have been much less cautious.
This is Adrian Coles, BSA.
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the chief executive of the Building Societies Association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the housing boom are now being called upon to foot part of the bill for those institutions that have been much less prudent".
According to the BSA, no company has failed since records began in 1945.
"We need to look at all the aspects in the coming weeks to see what options are there to protect the building societies and their members from what could be a significant bill", Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest for a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations with no shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk is 5p a gallon
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be a wholesale price increase for its milk for an extra five pence a litre from Monday.
It's the second price increase this year, following a two-pence increase in February, and it comes after research conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Bail denied for former Bangladeshi PM
A court in Bangladesh has denied a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was a member of parliament.
This case is one of many corruption charges pending against you.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks but her party, Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-backed interim government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is unclear under the terms of her release, whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he'll appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The high court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail application on the grounds that she cannot get bail as she is already abroad on medical parole", says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the High Court order".
His lawyers say he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against them.
Fear of Afghan anti-polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing out on the recent immunization campaign because of Taliban-related violence, says the UN.
The UN has been running a vaccination program in six provinces for the past week.
But it is said that it cannot reach children in the Helmand and Kandahar areas in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this is despite Taliban promises that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB was told by the Competition Appeal Tribunal to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had said that BSkyB's participation was hindering competition and allowing unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV's stake cast doubt on ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator all opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into US prosecutor's case
The US attorney general has appointed a special prosecutor to look into the firing of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the Justice Department's inspector general criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fears that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or verified", said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that the fired lawyers had not been rated worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the firing was politically motivated.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegation of voter fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute cases in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they can't be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the firing squad, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials resigned.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he bore primary responsibility for the firings, had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the process.
Other officials, including former Bush senior aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be receiving his special golden award at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honoured" to earn the recognition.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the shortlist in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of those".
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required strong vocals that were provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell stayed on the charts for almost nine years and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a vocal cord cyst.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other thoroughfares, some famous, some merely usable.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and runs north from First Street  without making Second Street  between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alleyway than an active busy road.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway for the shops and boutiques that are supposed to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were struck by the cul-de-sac simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately neighborhood of the past.
But the city's Department of Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Township Land Use Committee of the Township Board some representatives of the Township and Avalon Bay Agency outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the avenues.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of Community Board District 3.
"There is very little space left to city ownership, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place", he said.
"There may be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access".
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it would reopen the small road and install seating, including some for use in a café that the real estate company hopes to rent the space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean they want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renovate this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity", he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Housing, said it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe it was named in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many sons and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo for the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The terrain was beautiful", said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, bits of clothing and bits of boots, posters, leaves, ropes".
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about the "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity  a fragment of the city almost unchanged that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Slightly Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), published part of a Discourse on the History of the City that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, dead-end alley, dark even in the daylight and bordered by rusty warehouse doors and window shades with weeks-old newspapers fluttering down the slums".
With a few exceptions, the street looked almost the same as it had on a recent night.
A rat ran agilely across the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer laying next to a pile of freshly abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggested it needed a bit of a makeover.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he thinks some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places".
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow at the California Studies and the senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School".
Getting the Hispanic voters to vote for you is a tricky business.
Barack Obama's education projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom instruction in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The students at the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, are studying English.
But among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students did the Advanced Placement test in the 2008 state mathematics exam.
An equally astonishing 93 percent of fourth graders passed the English-language-arts-proficiency test.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant skill evaluation and a "no excuses" attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Sixth Street's director, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion".
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who had just come from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you would not have been able to identify who it was".
"It works", he observed, "for us it works".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model and replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools with English students?
The school's achievements make that question very easy to answer, but the educational policy in his own party (the National Education Associations is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and his own continued support for bilingual education make it difficult to predict Mr. Obama's answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the argument trivial when he said people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to make sure that your children are able to speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than belittling or trivializing them.
Oil drops sharply renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid concerns that even the U.S. bailout of financial markets may not be able to lift the economy.
Crude futures are down 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the morning trading.
Prices have dropped more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodities markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had fallen to almost $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the biggest bailout in history.
The news was clouded by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest installment of the gradual merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenzied weekend trading that had led to a bailout deal "seemed to have failed to revive market sentiment".
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to ease.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that the raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China".
Bank analysts lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption declines due to the slowdown in economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The second-quarter feat is a team record.
Having spent more time in the Jets uniform than anyone else in the last eight-plus seasons, defensive back Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then he watched Sunday's second quarter play out, as the Jets turned a scoreless game into a comeback.
"Never seen anything like it", said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had equaled the grey of the threatening clouds above them with a flickering play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon in which their rising tune took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including one when a cornerback went down and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't go off my path", Favre said of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people may think".
As Favre and Coles played catch, the defense was hitting hard at Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walk and returned it for 32 yards on a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith anticipated another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens has a fumble by Warner.
The final turnover, Bowens' forced fumble, may have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal, for a 34-to-nothing lead.
That's more than the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave up 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third".
There were a lot of stitches in a short amount of time".
Gebrselassie rested to break his own world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown again why many consider him the greatest marathon runner of all time, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile race in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in the favourably flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shatters his previous record of 2:03:26 run last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record in a career so amazing that it has produced a world champion or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-marathoners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to the long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps in his calves and missed a week of training.
Clearly, rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I am so happy", Gebrselassie told reporters, adding that he was "very happy".
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well".
He has been criticized a bit - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, relying on the open-track as if it were a half-marathon race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace of four Kenyan cyclists on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the openers vanished.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made a final upset to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi came third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is being described as a bad crash, but recovered to win in Berlin, setting her personal best time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race that she did well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start with a big gap, catching them up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Tucked away in the sprawling theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, just a few miles from the glitz, the noise, the enormity, lies the quiet city where the pride and the complications of the African-American experience come to life.
Eatonville, the first all-black incorporated town in the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the town of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no jail".
It's a place of pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the town he described - and which makes tourists stop by including it in the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project's Florida tourist guide - remains a place apart.
It is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, does not know what he is missing".
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called to a keynote address on race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told", said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It must be right".
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It's both a historic model of black power grab and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also a shadowy example of the rural black culture of the South - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida Guide transformed the town, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten heart of Florida into a setting of black history and human drama.
A low-life and literary titan, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted them to more private areas.
"Off the road to the left", he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white trim, with its well-kept and courtyards gardens, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could hardly read and write".
She also mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that fits in the passing rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriages and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it like it was", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls who Hurston immortalised, quoting men singing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it".
Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who frequently returned from her family's relocation to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston was in town, he would arrive unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts dignified attire.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others were puzzled.
"People were always very glad to see Zora", said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, rocking in his chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "he never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial services, and no big conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980's.
Orange County officials wanted to lay a five-lane freeway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the relative idyll of the community's isolation.
In the 1950's, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the doorstep of the community.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on the side", says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl killed by that one time.
They threw a watermelon out of a car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston petitioned the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "an insult rather than an honor to my race".
Residents now say that desegregation of the schools, while positive in some ways, is diluting Eatonville's cohesion and jeopardizing the confidence of its young people.
"Black kids used to be hugged - I remember this - you'd hug your teacher in the morning, you'd hug your teacher in the evening", said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This continued, he added, until the teachers and students were not from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural divide there", said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like, "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't figure it out".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long walk to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookstore shelves, reintroducing her to the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had once again turned the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state backed away from its road project.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway, have brought what you would call high speed, a real pride for the city", Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
Winning on the highway project helped change the image the city has of itself.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, started showing up in large numbers, and residents started reevaluating the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new single-story bookstore (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can feel like a back street in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to seek the history of Eatonville, for its significance, are often still treated with caution.
Prior permission is required for most interviews, but some things - like the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a chubby teacher with a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as the Hurston Festival has expanded, so has a high level of civic pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, troubled and all, not better, not worse and fierce, creative, hard-working, dumb and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the police department, which he said might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just got here, will think, 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon after a recent Sunday service.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the history, it's a really pretty city".
Here in New York, we all speak fluently of finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nestled high above their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crash.
The porters shake metal tea carts across the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for the breakfast meetings.
Hispanics drag their feet between apartment blocks carrying, like human mules, 50 broken, straightened shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees still queue for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it's still impossible to get a yellow taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a workday.
There didn't seem to be a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the affair to coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask directions to Macy's department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "trusted banker", were in line for the same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken the savings from the smaller banks in the places where the commuters are located, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrift (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and types of community savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers like family.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been placed under supervisory administration, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a buyer to bail it out.
The employees and customers in front of me, terrified of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more Wall Street collateral.
In recent weeks, ordinary New Yorkers have become proficient in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its emaciated general manager Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And, Lyn, the uniformed janitor, nearly 50 years old from my apartment building, has changed the subject from our usual topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!
I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to introduce the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like those on the street representing mosques with a red line running through the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties gained a lot in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz in the few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which occurred near the end of Ramadan, a religious month for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, has embarked on a spiritual quest following its rightward turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party of Austria and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with strongly anti-immigration ticket tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the vote, has campaigned against veils and burkas and has also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as being connected to Islam.
At the final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election established the far right as the strongest political bloc in the nation, indicating that change was predominantly being brought about by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel banned for Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities monitoring him that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The Kent Police were granted the travel ban last Thursday after they provided evidence to magistrates of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at the Ashford Crown Court in Kent but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Crown Court, Kent Police lodged a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person".
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he intended to travel abroad as required by the sex offender registry.
He must give notice to the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police seven days' notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police have said they don't want to discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible movements in the country.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
"It is easier, in our view, to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have adequate comprehensive systems in place to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of the Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted sex offenders across the country to minimise any potential risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was feeling ill and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities would not let him pass passport control and he eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the police station in Uxbridge, west London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him on the sex offenders' register.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing child abuse images.
A Home Office source said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no flyers, no clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the performance, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On one side, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two faces that are inseparable, except in private, in those moments far from the audience, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they don't have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on the stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, which is growing every day", explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be about ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and to capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these great men, it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
Because their personality and character is internal.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco players".
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
These are portraits that, because of the type of machine and material, are reminiscent of classic photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day".
Not the dancing, the singing or the playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of winning over the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and of being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portraits by artists.
The project has become a sort of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to get to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment into their life, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portraiture is the hardest genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters that you sometimes don't even know or who only allow you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas concrete".
The collection of contemporary flamenco portraits, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 of the Via de la Mata, parallel to the Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "chance"
It is set in places he still does not know and deals with unknown subjects: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
The writer, who has always been a favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that the project he is working on today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write it".
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible", he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as expected, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the writer most voted by the participants  an antique edition of Dickens' book "Our mutual friend", filled the seats at the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to whom time has flown when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, has recalled how he was born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "to live beyond what I lived"; how he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous re-making; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and how "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist, has acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience", Vargas Llosa stressed, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "makes people more non-conformist".
Weather is hampering the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfighting
The celebration of the bullfights that were supposed to seal the days of the Festival of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The weather has been so bad that two out of three days of the festival have been lost.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second running of the bulls.
In the picture were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would have to face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having bullfighted with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante completed his two races, receiving a salute and an ear, granted more by the audience than by the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous muleta, he earned the whistles of a large part of the audience.
A truck with 2,000 kilos of hashish passes the checkpoint in Alava
It's five minutes to ten in the morning.
Officers alert two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, run away.
Officers alerted the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, ran away.
Their cargo, over two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers chased them down and arrested one of the occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., according to a statement from the Basque government's Interior Ministry.
The individual arrested is charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The accident occurred when some road officials from Alava were carrying out a traffic check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, in defiance of orders, suddenly accelerated and overtook the checkpoint.
The officers pursued the vehicle until it stopped on the side of the road after a couple of kilometers, and the two occupants fled into a wooded area.
Erzaintza agents were able to arrest one of the fugitives and to seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting and they noted once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish bags, which were found in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently taken into police custody for further investigation and weight tracking.
Furthermore, since officials found that the number plate had been "duplicated" because it did not match the one shown on the van's registration papers, the arrested man was also charged with the offense of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The prisoner A. A. J., 28 years old, was taken to the police station to carry out the necessary procedures and to be at the disposal of the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda from the popular TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her performing a risky maneuver while trying to drive her car out of the parking lot at Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness stated that at about 4:30 p.m. Locklear "was slamming the gas pedal, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with abrupt back and forth manoeuvres, backing up, passing several times in front of her sunglasses".
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance did not seem to recognize the actress, saw Locklear pull up on a nearby road and exit the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services because "she was concerned for Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused", and that's why the officers took her to a drug and alcohol-use facility to have her tested.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has been cooperative and the alcohol problem has been ruled out from the start, although "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local jail around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released and rehabilitated from a specialty clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to take responsibility for the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of education to make a decision on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organisation that will have to take its own responsibility", said Llamazares as regards the resolution that the party will have to adopt against the one who has been until now an adviser in the Sevillian council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva allegedly committed. "The UI has always wanted that this type of investigation we have the utmost transparency".
He also stressed that training is governed by "very strict codes of ethics for all public offices".
"Sangre de mayo", the epic wager made by Garcia
Inspired by Episodios Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci re-proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spaniards against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of interpreters.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in theaters, to become a future TV miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized "a childhood dream" with this film, and feels he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who was commissioned by the Community of Madrid three years before to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of 2 May medrilegno. The director had accepted on condition that the story was based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budget, all of which was provided by the Community of Madrid, represented a "unique opportunity" for Garci to recreate the scenery and costumes to portray "a stunned Spain that had the wrong leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge developmental delay under the reign of Ferdinand VII", Garci noted.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de mayo, for which it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided for by the scenography that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to rehearse before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating", considering that "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works".
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, rehearse in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "who should instead be known".
This is not a film Garci expects awards.
"At first you think you're working for posters, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you settle for just making one more film", explains Garci after more than 30 years in the business.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the essence of the Spanish dancer Tortola Valencia
A dancer from Seville pays tribute to another dancer from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a free-dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of women's emancipation, the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and advocated for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in the field of dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character.
The dancer maintains: "We don't claim to tell his whole life, but to capture the spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested to me some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tanghi.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing was part of this aesthetic", she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been a pupil of hers.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy that he has agreed to work in my opera and I feel very honoured by this".
The set also includes the musical composition and guitarists like Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi by Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal accompanist of these artists who have been dives all round, and who have always had many entertainers".
The opera also presents in some form the life of this woman who takes place in faraway places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all over Europe, since, habitually, she resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and even less considers her work as something of value", says Bayon.
The show will begin today at 8:30 at the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of the Diario de un poeta recién casado also marks the end of the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Cultural Advisory of the Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Triennio de Zenobia y Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature and the death of both.
The "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" thus concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel's house-museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having visited the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York at the same time as the International Congress.
In addition, the Cultural Office of the Junta of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Reciencasado Poet", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the Andalusian poets of highest value.
America is a little less like it without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
The phrase is by the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of the American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Yet it took him a long time to get him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for all of us.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend", cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been made better by his existence".
No one was afraid of looking ridiculous or going overboard.
A father of cinema and of the nation died in a particularly dark moment, from fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, desperately searching for new motives to feel worthy.
When times are so hard, men so without virtue and yet people to admire, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
To everyone, he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost causes, from the anti-drug foundation created in honor of the firstborn who died of overdose to the creation of the organic and home-cooked food brand.
All gifts to a country that has taken a lot to move beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without regard for nationality or passport.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not a man died, an era ended.
Another Brit, Sam Mendes, the Oscar-winning director, said that working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He set a very high standard for all of us", observes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for integrity and having a private life that is serious and away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some do try, and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He was divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful though he certainly did not miss the opportunity to be otherwise.
"Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today when I have a steak in the house?" he used to joke.
He is proud in heaven that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he was most proud of none as a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and passionate philanthropist", they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever been in.
A lot of nonsense, which if it were to be taken into account later in the evaluation and I had to examine it, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense started with the retreat of the spine, which presupposed that you were going first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, it's to collect everything (including the chip to avoid the queues during the race).
I'm not going to.
You just had to go and get the back (first silly, go for this one) and (after the tail), surprise! they only had 'S' size shirts (second silly, because I need an XL size).
What kind of world are we living in?
Is it the crisis that has made them decide to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, things like that are trivial compared to race day itself.
Besides having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes long and, more than that, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected by more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started before we had even put the backpack in, although, once we had done that, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and storming of the stand.
At least 500 people tomorrow will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, won't even be ranked in the correct order because of the chip, which I guess didn't register the arrival correctly.
In the future, when people ask me about the perfect race, this is not going to be on my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual receptionist.
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft previewed a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, that can perform some basic tasks, like hailing a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a shuttle service to get around the company campus) by assisting the phone user.
Using a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this receptionist is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group those in attendance into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist notices a third person, but she understands that he is not from the group she is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if she's there to visit someone and tells her he'll be available shortly.
All without the blue screen.
That's very impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of its Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial junk, they would run five times faster.
Quite a breakthrough, considering that Microsoft, version after version, has continually added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is becoming less important, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the web, I was one of those who argued that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a vital element for the hardware and software to communicate.
It serves the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but perhaps we need to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You pick up your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox -- or Chrome -- and every day we spend more time browsing the web than in a remote, window-based environment.
What are half the applications in the operating system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is interested in integrating its own online services more to make them a viable alternative to Google.
They are in desperate need of it, in fact, and I'll give you a little example.
I took the photograph included in this post at one of Microsoft's Redmond employee rec room earlier this month.
On the soda machine, a sign urges them to use their own search tool - "Your Search. Our Future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a web search.
Last week, it was confirmed that the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not be on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more of a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is a penalty.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's Diamonds of Blood, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and it was part of the uniform of the gay, muscular parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forcible one with the pointed mustache lifting the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, a typical men's shirt, with a cotton inside, fitted and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the English speakers call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all others.
The "Marcel" is distinguished from the others by the high quality of the cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive emblem and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the T-shirt wear as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" stands out from the others for the high quality of its cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive crest and the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian firm's production is not limited to the famous "tank".
Also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer shorts, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them for underwear.
They're too good.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't bother me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but she's full of life.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in fashion very seriously.
To Monica, I'm more than just pretty girls and celebrities who lend their names.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm has done of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Hot and shy, she'll get you fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very busy day, but at the same time, exciting.
What are the elements of your new Mango collection in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both like the cinema of the 50s and 60s, and we get a lot of inspiration from here.
Then I love to get lost in the city and watch how women dress, how they mix and match their clothes.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, everything comes together and there's a lot of common ground.
I loved clothes since I was a little girl, and I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closet and see her clothes.
It was a blast, even better than going to the playground.
Then, as a dancer, I always paid close attention to my dress.
You know, dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and to the sages, to look at themselves in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when they hand you the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, it all goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you had a breakdown?
But no, I did not.
I've never heard better. I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that women at that age are mature and have a good experience to savor life and make fewer mistakes.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
I've done the things I wanted to do since I was a kid, and that's given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about becoming a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body is asking me to be one, and I also want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not too worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're expecting to see a few films from last year in theaters.
That's right, and I'm dying to get them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything to be clear and straightforward, but it can't always be like that.
I want to see "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ".
Let 's see how you like them .
A few days ago, you debuted on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the runway as a model.
It's just that Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity run for her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes that we exhibited - I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango - were put up for auction to raise funds for this NGO of Naomi's.
People don't know this sweet side of Naomi.
There are so many things about her that I, who have known her for a long time, can confirm that they are not so true.
Besides, I'm stuck with this good part where she's involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pin, I'd do it anyway.
If it's to help women in the Third World, you can't back down.
Alcoholic drivers will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive blood alcohol levels, install in your car the system that prevents the vehicle from driving in a state of intoxication or if you do not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The aim of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since he will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety Foundation (FITSA) will be involved in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers who are reported more than once for drunk driving then drive their car again.
Alcohollock would avoid this, because it is a system attached to the vehicle that measures the alcohol content of exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher than permitted alcohol concentration is detected.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the convicted.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
The Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
At 5:40 p.m. on British time, the Spanish plane carrying the Princes of Asturias landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced me to use my hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the scaffold, the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can not go to the airport to load people at that time ... you are from here or ...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the Asturian princes are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar, huddled to the red carpet and the military cord of 27 Marines offering the salute.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, is leaning in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes", perhaps she was told that bad weather was threatening Mexico City.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief stop before they enter the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of their hotel, one of the four largest in the city, a witty Mexican television reporter is waiting.
The Best Fashion Award
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris, and there is probably no more exquisite and well-lived designer than Valentino.
Mango has just launched the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the fashion field.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
It is also the company's second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square metres of extension.
The first is in London.
The events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who was the chairman of the jury, began with a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the presence of Chagal's finest canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born with a broken heart and doing virtue out of necessity, because of the recent death of his brother, he wore a suit of the House and some compliments of ELAH to take away the breath and to the arm of his son Luis - a big boy of almost two meters in height - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and as a knight he ended, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had given it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in pants and shirts  drawn by her hand  transformed herself for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and was moved during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the ballet essay room and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "grand flie".
Inés Sastre didn't stop for the walk in the building's rooms, but she had shown us pictures of her son on her cell phone before.
The next day we were delighted to see Olivier Martinez, another young man who moved around on a motorcycle, and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his bed sheets and towels, and had made sure beforehand that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, c'est the street.
1001, the stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and one way to forget the hectic and hectic daily life.
And if that wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m. every morning, but it is even worse to imagine oneself caught up in the frenzied pace of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the fatigue of leaving the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga postures, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book a whole "menu" of options tailored to each individual's taste and time.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calm will reach bookstores thanks to publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to achieve calmness in such areas as work or in personal relationships, this "manual" belies that belief.
She also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If your adrenaline isn't already coursing through your veins to bring your body back into balance, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, shut your mind off, and focus on your reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some babies talk in the night.
I am not talking about those who wake up very excited to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but those children who talk while they are asleep.
The first time it happens, you're scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somniloquy.
It occurs with some frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure most of you have been told that you talk in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, e.g. associated with an episode of high fever) or more regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes these episodes are linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (bedwetting), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily.
As mentioned earlier, it can be associated with stages of very high fever, stress or over-excitement.
However, it is still a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
The person may speak in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or the opposite may occur (screaming, shouting, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, the child should be observed and possibly consulted by a specialist to see if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outflow from the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or a stressful situation).
What can be done is to consider a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to over-excite the baby before he goes to sleep.
Offer peaceful games and avoid TV shows or series that instill fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children who find it difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain a measure of inner calm.
This will help the baby to sleep more soundly.
Once the sleepiness sets in, try to remain calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the baby and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Helpful Tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's happening, and you'd interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember, if he appears very anxious and the episodes occur frequently, it is best to consult a doctor or to find out what is causing such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the most common situation), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You'll get nothing, because he's asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say, so great care must be taken in interpreting the information and the conclusions it might lead to.
Never tell the child that you may ask questions during the night to learn his secrets.
Not even for fun.
Such a thing causes enormous anguish.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally found its way back home after a long period of unsuccessful.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-blacks created the most number of net opportunities turning one of them into the game's victory.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann who scored seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after another provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirn high, Romain of the tip and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in midfield, leaving only the rampaging Riahi in the attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two opening opportunities signed by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first net of Marais for Illhaeusern, well positioned, he recovered a ball rejected on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the gunner of the Illhaeusern will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But the Dannemarie will not take advantage of it and will not cause great problems to the Eleven of Illhaeusern, who did not retreat just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the very last minutes of the game when, after a rocambolesque action, the ball touched the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen at the port of Goma
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Britain.
Before the demonstration of the fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, on Tuesday morning to enchant the representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "present concrete proposals".
The President's visit coincided with the general assembly of the 'crisis committee' set up by the Breton fishermen to take measures to deal with the surge in the price of diesel, which has reached its record high with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies regain competitiveness and to make the working conditions and the pay of the seamen safe".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "swallow operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
Quiberon's port was also blocked, but connections to Belle-Île were not cut.
A road block has been put in place on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination by burning tyres and paddles in front of fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient, and by starting demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to ports on the Atlantic and the Channel coast, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where fishing vessels have remained at anchor, or Havre, where some twenty boats have prevented commercial vessels from moving.
The fishermen of La Turballe et du Croisic, in the Atlantic Loire, broke the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting at the Ministry on Wednesday to decide on any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday on the future actions of the movement and its possible participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up" and "they have no intention of moving to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel is only reached with less than 0.30 euro per litre of diesel.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable Butch Cassidy died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have all said goodbye to movie legend and actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the recession threatening the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest airline, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado has confirmed.
During the first half of the year, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company has a strong reliance on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, an insurance company that has been resurrected by the US monetary authorities, is to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to consider selling most of its business, as well as divesting its life insurance business to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said, citing authoritative sources.
AIG's board met on Sunday evening to consider the possible divestments, according to the FT.
AIG has not been able to confirm this.
The assets AIG intends to divest include the aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these divestments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity to repay the 85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of the US authorities seizing 80% of its capital.
Paris: the story of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic collapse on Monday after the House of Representatives voted against Paulson's plan to bail out financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an all-time low, to close to 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down by 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) exceeds that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the major technology stocks, lost 199.61 points to close at 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 extended index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to close at 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralised at the start, Wall Street plunged after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the House rejected funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this shows how much the market was counting on the project", he added, fearing that in a few days it might be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were indeed moribund (...) then the torch would be quickly passed to the Fed  Federal Reserve and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
The Commission's proposal is to set up a European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) to provide a forum for the exchange of information on vocational training and the exchange of information on vocational training.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities arranged for the purchase of Wachovia's banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency action to be taken on behalf of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not just facing an American crisis, but a global crisis", added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market went up.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries has fallen to 3.632%, down from 3.827% on Friday night, while the yield on 30-year Treasuries is 4.161%, down from 4.357% the day before.
Obama in the lead in the first televised match
After Friday's first debate between the two candidates for the White House, here's a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their respective victories in the televised duel, followed by one-third of American households.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stem the decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
Gallup, whose poll released Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49 percent to 44 percent for McCain), shows that the Democrat has the upper hand.
A snap poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them believe Obama is the winner, while 25% are betting on McCain.
A strong showing by his running mate Joe Biden, expected in the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's lead on Thursday.
"To underestimate her would be a mistake.
He has a good sense", warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain never ceased to promote his unquestioned foreign policy expertise, pointing out the opponent's "simplicity" in the topics discussed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he has often stated on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the skills to be president", he assured.
Which since yesterday has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign.
President Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without going into too much detail, he was concise and precise.
He promoted his willingness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama", he said this weekend in a Democratic spot, berating the Republican for not taking the necessary steps to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, denounced Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for a campaign rally.
The financial crisis is going in Obama's favor, who is seen by Americans as the person most suited to save the economy from the brink of collapse.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point", said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic acumen to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating his intention to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the threats of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously dodged questions focused on the $700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to contest the legislative results in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening in Minsk's central square after polling stations closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative process.
While the results were still pending, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit that they didn't even vote. "What for? They can do whatever they want with my vote", says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression on the outside world with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban on 40 Belarusian officials and the asset freeze, could be lifted if these elections are considered legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were removed from the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to take part in the counting of votes", complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of 12 parties.
"It is a change of face", stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the ballots, and in this case it is the executive.
If opposition members enter Parliament, it is because they have been nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and bill proposals".
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into crisis, and we do not provide any reforms, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the electoral process, will recognise the validity of the ballot.
It stressed that participation rates appeared to be too high and that the widespread use of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the way to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections?" asks social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be at most five opposition members of parliament, the most convenient to power".
The night silence falls on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission boast about their success.
The meeting - the blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, it has won back the public's trust, which was badly shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood supply operated by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service was infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980's.
In the face of such a tragedy and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, headed by Justice Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent a similar disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was slow to draw up a report, some provinces formed a committee to devise a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Québec and Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Québec, recalls Dr. Décary.
It was a mortifying situation.
Thanks to continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the next few years, we have regained public trust", she explains before proudly stating that by the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease in Europe, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the woman who has been its president since 1998, the year of its foundation.
"And we had no idea that the disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, namely that when there is doubt and a serious illness could follow, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself in a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, blood was rejected from those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Now, for some years, it has been proved beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by infected blood.
This incident has thus shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle".
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TANs), which allow the presence of the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors, rather than the presence of antibodies against it, on which the tests used up to then were based.
TANs have allowed the window period to be shortened, from the time the person contracted the disease to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, the specialist explains.
It was possible to reduce that period to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and thus not being able to detect them has thus been greatly reduced.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving blood contaminated with the HIV virus.
"In other words, it would take 12 million blood samples to be distributed before anyone could be infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion is detected.
I think that today people can feel safe to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore their health, says the head of the Héma-Québec branch.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen is going to emerge in the system.
The Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect, appeared on Reunion Island just over a year ago.
We must be constantly vigilant", continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that, in addition to having safe resources, Héma-Québec must also ensure that it has enough.
"Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average is only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors. "
However, all healthy persons over 18 years of age who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who volunteer to donate are turned down because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they've traveled to a country where AIDS is widespread, they'll be turned away for a year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortage are very rare.
But the members of this group of donors must be renewed as they grow older and can no longer make donations.
Now it's hard to convince people to donate blood, but especially to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that it is hard to find an hour to donate blood", says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed, and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec, which operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, once considered a biomedical waste, there is a lot of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the deposit of our thousandth cord blood sample a few weeks ago and plan to draw more than a thousand each year.
They should be proposed for transplants early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood draw as a very popular practice.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it", because Héma-Québec does not have the resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Québec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact have qualified for the semi-finals of the A-League playoffs, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive game of the quarter-finals, at Saputo Stadium.
Antonio Ribeiro, the midfielder, scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a goalless first half from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score on Matt Jordan.
We'll recall that the first round of the return game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundlers got a 3-1 start in the second half to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still be in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on both Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed later today.
In short - Kovalev's decisive net
The Canadien and his aces are ready to start the season.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn lightened up the offensive phase of the game with a 3-2 win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first game, scored a goal, threw two passes, and collected a pass for the win in the fourth of the Habs' preseason games.
The only network signed Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
"I'm not ready yet", warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable".
"He tried to go overboard in the first period, " Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he enjoyed the outcome of the game.
There was a great applause".
Charest points north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of elections before the end of the year.
The Liberal Party's general council ended yesterday with Jean Charest heading to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
'Expanding the borders of our last great northern frontier' - this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, which he presented to Levis yesterday, with powerful visual instruments, at the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Mill of Images".
On three large screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining farms, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc. were confused.
Big vehicles like in the middle of a campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he indicated that he was very busy.
The 'Northern Plan' is the fourth part of a 'project' which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a 'new economic area', comprising a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what precise priorities would be in the implementation of future projects.
At most, he merely pointed out what he considered deserved a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has undergone several improvements as a result of the growth of the emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That territory twice the size of France, it's here, it's Quebec.
It is not only here, but it is in us", he insisted, as if to call up a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, the national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future", he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, which is 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government", he said.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the existing rules to include the introduction of a new system of national quotas for the production of wine.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory to be a duty.
What about the local people, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would be in their interests, especially the young people's.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ MP for Ungava), have already started the consultation of some thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, with Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holding a prominent position, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a time when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the Liberal Prime Ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals before us, we know how to distinguish ourselves by turning challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival as party leader.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois plant Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, the creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, the creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future", said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he referred to another, this time conservative, reference to the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest said that it would be commissioned in 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will make it", he confessed to his militants, prompting loud applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who in April said that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he was certainly very busy, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform for nationalist resolutions, particularly the "constitutional aspirations" that were passed like oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the draft of the Northern Plan was met with scepticism.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has dusted the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
She believes that the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected the application of the law.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today", commented Marois, alongside the Jean-Talon candidate (screened today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated that it supports the government's adoption of the Nord Plan.
"What we hope is that this is not just a show", commented leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, returning from holiday today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (ironically) in the Harper cabinet, who took the liberty of declaring last summer that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
To disgrace in this way a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government which is the only one of all the Western countries involved which has not repatriated a citizen of its own from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that completely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the alleged events.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its word and leaves a child soldier to die in inhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to establish the defendant's guilt.
For your information, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for Omar Khadra's repatriation so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is the same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We don't realize it yet, but we are witnessing a sneaky erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper doesn't stop flaunting and that sounds so foolish on his lips.
We have reached the point where there is no longer any morality: a Canadian citizen can be mistreated, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned at the discretion of a head of government who has been a minority government until now (let's see what happens after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order is the salvation: they do not see that this government has given up what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
That's where the shame lies, Mr. Toews, in renouncing all of this, and nowhere else.
Free speech - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, executive vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six million defamation suit against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house with the intention of initiating a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a libel suit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to take a position contrary to its own.
No matter the outcome of the trial, the writers and publishers of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a huge amount of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decidedly unequal arms, against an army of lawyers financed by the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these conflicts, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to speak out again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that it should have presented its view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada the debate is normally held through exchanges of views and not through the use of batons.
So it would have been enough for the company to open its books, its documents, and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have much confidence in public opinion and has been badly rejecting petitions and letters of support for the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can call for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same public is so obvious?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the slanderers have a say.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand  or doesn't want to understand  is that the public who support Canada Black's authors and publishers do so primarily because they reject the brutal methods employed by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the light of what many perceive as a sort of gagging (looking for the "public debate", Barrick Gold just gave the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum telling them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the lawsuit brought by Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, which are indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and debate issues that are inconvenient to the world's richest corporations, and that could lead to multiple lawsuits, who can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, they could do it by following scientific standards, as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have a right to reply.
For a long time, the academic environment of which we are a part has been able to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is damaging to academia and to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take action to curb abusive litigation.
Operation - bailout for Wall Street  Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, representing the Republican and Democratic parties, yesterday finally reached an agreement on the largest bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been weighing on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular for checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the repayment of public money, new provisions to curb the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of inspection on the salaries paid to the managers of protected enterprises.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican negotiator Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets", said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"That's the crux of it: if we hadn't acted this way, inestimable discomfort and upset would have been poured into the daily lives of Americans", Republican Judd Gregg said.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The deadline agreed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the US presidency, who later joined the negotiations, were quite in favour of the agreement, but did not shy away from expressing their dissatisfaction before adopting extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding some provisions to the agreement, particularly the one that will allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one concerning the salaries of state-owned business executives.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary", he commented on the American TV screen.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied I would like to look into the details, but I hope so.
"From what I've read, it's something we all have to digest and that will allow us to move on".
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back the bad loans, bad assets and unsellable assets of American financial institutions with taxpayer money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of subprime mortgages (mortgages), then to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and resulted in liquidity freezing and the liquidation of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in office that blew up the first draft of a deal last week.
They seem to have come out of that dead end since the Democrats have accepted that the "toxic" assets of some struggling companies are only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone's needs, a provision was added to the Congress that if the government were to face losses over the next five years because of this program, it could impose new taxes to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for an initial payment of 250 billion, to which 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment would have to be ratified by another vote in Congress.
In return for its aid, Washington will get shares in the sheltered companies that will pay dividends if it makes a profit and that it can sell when the dust settles.
Under the plan, the Federal Government will be able to delay foreclosure proceedings relating to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and severance pay paid to the managers of the companies involved.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, there were several votes against the bill yesterday, from both the Republican and Democratic parties.
"Obviously, Washington is not listening", said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, addressing his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers.
Leader of a small congressional caucus nicknamed "the skeptics caucus", Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat, presents the situation differently, but reaches the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel prize winners, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to jump to conclusions and to examine carefully the way forward", he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would not buy its competitor, which was in full bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 billion (USD 2.9 billion) in the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and one of the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not money wasted", Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, they receive influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain".
At the same time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government appears to be in the process of nationalising another bank in the throes of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans currently outstanding at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than $41 billion in mortgages.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be buying the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the start of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the British Government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his ace in the hole, for others his weak point.
Was he free of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the enchanting smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful men devoted to true and holy monsters.
What a consistency!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of the golden age of American cinema.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was a sort of rival on the screen for a long time, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but he also speaks for freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
Mixed marriages often produce magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots will emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because in him you could recognize a whole country invaded by the safe made man, the fighter of the war of the Pacific, proud in the fight, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art at Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in the cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the race car driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and a sex symbol, though part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him, the shadows of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of show business, whose mystery will never be fully revealed.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend, the passing of Paul Newman was a heartbreaking moment for moviegoers, as his great characters populate the black screen of memory.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is re-proposed through his interpretations.
The memories of the charming cowboy in Butch Cassidy (1969) and the boy unable to desire his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958 are confused.
More recently, he is remembered as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that failed to deliver on its promises.
Many other Paul Newmans have passed into history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somewhere Over There Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which Newman officially launched in 1956.
That nice, bad-ass in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
He was a bitter and vindictive billiards player in Lo Spaccone, a magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), Martin Scorsese's Il colore dei soldi, which earned him the only Oscar out of 9 nominations in 1987.
That face through the years, it was his.
It's him again.
The ages follow one another along its path.
Young people know him best for the cult film Slap Shot (1977), in which he played Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, by the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with a final role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in It Was My Father, in 2003.
Unlike the most legendary film stars who soon abandoned the craft, Newman will remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its pomp, parties and concessions.
French film-maker Bertrand Tavernier called it, with a touch of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging its performances exaggerated.
The profession wasn't always a play for the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic, alcoholic, caragine or desperate characters, whose slop and rebellion he expressed with his perfect traits.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed unknown shades of his true, poetic sensibility.
Jennifer's 1968 debut (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, traced a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes paid to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness: "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love of life, two great characteristics of the late actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger to the Hollywood drift, has died.
We'll have seen his face splashed on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other food, judging it a poor-tasting choice, though born as a joke.
The proceeds from those sales were, however, earmarked for his Foundation for Children in Need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman chose to commit himself to the end.
He left a letter to his five daughters that said, "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And it was just as much a privilege for us to follow in the footsteps of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, then, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & soci?
The hearing on the criminal case against János Zuschlag and associates will be held shortly, on 8 October.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the context of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other offences, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from tenders was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the implementation of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, totalling 65 million guilders, went partly into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, partly into the pockets of some people.
According to the methodology, as noted by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained from calls for tenders on the basis of invoices for transactions that did not exist and the associations never fulfilled the obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were fake.
For the production of the invoices, the blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, while the circular stamps were made in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide in the name of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among other things during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession, he had to choose between pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consumption, and on the basis of this invoice the invoices were prepared for the calls for tenders, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András Őri, who, according to our information, mainly drew up the reports needed to obtain the funds.
One of the choices of the "study trip" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and associates in 2003, the restaurant served meals to a group of 90 persons from the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But so many people, according to the restaurant owner, would not all enter the restaurant at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, is full of formal and substantive errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, no more than 10 people could stay there, however, the bill listed 130 guests.
But the imaginative invoicers went too far when they pointed to Pigal Kft., also a catering company, whose accounts - according to the information provided to the judicial authorities - did not even contain documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's director, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the public prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he immediately realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and the VAT number of our company were in the wrong place".
He added: 'Apart from the formal reasons, it was not even necessary to mention that according to the bill 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have 11 rooms and there are not so many beds.'
And the bill was for catering, and their restaurant hasn't been open for a while.
The regular invoice-takers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only arranges foreign travel, so they shocked the invoice with a cash payment for travel to Hungary, which was not in accordance with the company's invoicing practice.
Moreover, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included in the invoice, while travel to countries outside the European Union is VAT-free.
The amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the VAT on the services offered by the company was 15% and not 25% as indicated on the invoices, and the hotel's employees issued only printed invoices, whereas the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "issuers" have spoiled other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as an activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as it is known from the procedure of the Prosecutor, an activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment consultancy.
Furthermore, due to formal defects - non-conforming invoice format, false stamp - it was found that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same was true of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Complex, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The forgers also did not pay attention to the fact that the Nyíregyháza HIB Kft. was in liquidation when (2001) a group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület had lunch there, which is why the curator of the company's liquidation, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have knowingly issued invoices
Another group of invoice issuers is made up of those who were aware that they had to issue bogus invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért foundation of almost 4 million forints.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Zuschlag and its partners also collaborated with the now liquidated Biogate Kft, which in 2003 provided invoices worth around HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület, which were not backed by any real economic activity.
The Commission has not yet decided on the basis of which the budget should be used.
The following group of invoicing firms includes those which are related to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the address of the general manager of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, purchased these invoices.
The general director of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov reportedly forwarded the documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted to having issued invoices in the name of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the counter value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian bricklayers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
But in fact none of the firms was operational, because according to the defendant they had not been given work.
The companies were nevertheless useful to him because, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, draftsman of the company's constituent documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In the name of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various bodies for a total value of HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecution believes Kubatov pocketed 10% of the invoices and the VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, fabricated for the call for tenders of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a call for tenders for the public utility body of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the call.
In order to keep this from coming to light, they submitted to TMA five bogus invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in the proceeding, will probably report on the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing might be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
It is necessary to see whether it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million guilders, a large part of the damage - would be willing to be the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could also have been offended at this point, since his requests for a lightening of his conditions of imprisonment, namely the granting of house arrest, have not been met so far.
The perpetrators of commercial crimes, which are not punishable and which cause much greater damage, are free to wander about or at least wait at home until the proceedings against them are over, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of over-bid: Why spend more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more, overvalue the goods.
Neuroscientists and economists at the State University of New York have been able to discover the neuroeconomic basis of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study in Science magazine, men don't want to be left behind in a competition like an eBay auction, so they're willing to pay a higher price.
The research has tried to trace the neural pattern of this "match" at the level of the nervous system through experimental stages.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in a raffle, and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were used to examine the active areas of the brains of the participants in the experiment.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the essential element is to bid more than the other, the striatum under the cerebral cortex becomes intensely active when you lose the game.
This brain area, among other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
So the researchers say the reason for the price increase is the body's violent reaction to the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists in the research group conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this investigation, three groups litigated against one partner under different circumstances.
They told the control group what the actual value of the product was and they made their own bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 prize.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the group members would lose the money if they lost at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that one group was emphasized for winning, while the other group was emphasized for losing.
Testing the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the "to lose" group were willing to bet higher than the control or "winning" group.
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and Parliament on the subject.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we have come to a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the New York University School of Economics.
Hepatitis: When Should I See a Doctor?
Almost half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is listed as a leading cause of death in Hungary.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis cases is one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name for infectious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
It is useful for travellers to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, but there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of infected food, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
Then yellowish spots form on the skin and on the whites of the eyes, faeces become light and urine dark, healing within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one person in ten receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause cirrhosis of the liver and cancers.
Most infected people are unaware that they have the disease because the pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20 to 30 years.
So prevention and regular medical checks are very important.
This disease is much more common than average in three groups: those who received a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus now stands at 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory test can reveal the disease, it is worth consulting your family doctor when any symptoms of unknown origin are noted.
If the disease is recognized in time and curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus stopping the infectious power and preventing the formation of tumors.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized worldwide in 2004 by hepatitis associations.
The aim is to raise awareness of chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Does believing in God make you feel less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith has acted as a kind of painkiller that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in God affects the feeling of pain, reports Britain's Telegraph.
In the bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were given an electric shock while all of them were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholic believers were able to repel much of the pain.
Through the technique of exploring the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling pain.
The test is the first in a series of research projects in which academics are also involved, as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University.
The test was carried out exactly as follows: A device that emits shocks and passes the electroshock was attached to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the 17th-century Virgin Mary by Sassoferrato and the 15th-century Lady with the Sash by Leonardo da Vinci.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a kind of religious status among believers, while the painting by Leonardo was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive sets, while they watched either the religious painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "secure", as if "someone was looking after" them, and "they were reassured and filled with peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image that has a strong effect even on atheists, but one must find the right image.
"We have to look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or a father", the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it does change our personality", Wright added.
After the excellent results, the only question remains is, if the faithful are presented with a painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber, what effect might it have on pain control?
Would a vision of a quality Virgin Mary have better results?
You are what you say you are
On its 10th birthday, Google can claim to be both in people's pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they've spent their holidays, which clinic they've been to and what interests them.
But that, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the firm's directors, is not enough.
As for the skeptics who make the Orwellian nightmare comparison, they don't see the substance of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and that this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google's founders which was: "put all the world's information in one system!"
According to the Google executive interviewed, the company, after 10 years of groundbreaking work, is still in the early stages of being able to handle all the information.
To the question of what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to answer questions like "what will I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?" But software cannot answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their Internet searches exactly what words are searched, from which IP address they are searched and on which page interested people stop after the search.
Using the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can store their browsing history, see what they have searched and clicked on, which will generate much better tailored results; this same logic is used in Recommendations, where the system offers products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - users worried about Google's data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the online counter-reactions are caused by the fear of the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the feeling of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, one fact is confirmed, that all the searched expressions are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against paedophiles in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that made it possible to identify paedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
But concerned netizens were relieved in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal defense association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: Google cannot be compelled by any provision of the Constitution to provide any information that the FBI secretly requests.
(At the same time the federal government successfully ripped up almost 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search terms obtained in reference to the upholding of the child protection law passed years ago, but still failed to obtain individual user search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords going back two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data scold Google because they believe that this will affect their privacy and privacy and start using its services and rise with the rebellion of the multinationals who stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users appearing in numerous countries see in them the future generation of the big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, the liquidated Microsoft as conqueror of the world because of Windows, because both are fighting for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask money for its services, the source code is always kept up to date and the software package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the keywords that has been repeated more often in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces behind and taking advantage of the communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimensions of these change for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young person can create profiles on several community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all of which can be entered into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which automatically appear his most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read numerous case studies from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common circle of friends, easily finds out with whom her treacherous boyfriend spent the night, or a company can fire an employee because he wrote a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is certain, the concept of privacy has now been completely reconsidered.
People who live their lives online make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis behind the behaviour of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (by starting with Scroogle, for example, using Google's search system but at the same time not voluntarily leaving traces).
There are many people who do not register on purpose to community pages so as not to be found, Google's online applications, from word processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions not tied to huge server parks and that do not make our best profile so far.
Public opinion is not waiting in the wings for Google to pull its claws out.
The company's $156 billion market value is now worth more than IBM's ($140 billion), Intel's ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola's ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space is threatening ad agencies' revenues, and services introduced in record time are causing major problems not only for Microsoft but also for many software development companies.
However, critical observers find alarming points alongside all this: the company's top management, for example, has completely rejected the employees' protest after doubling the company's asylum line, has deemed the repeated daily catering to be too expensive, but all this diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google has subordinated the head of the Chinese government and according to their agreement the company will filter all results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it is usable, but one thing is certain, that the predictable problems of the next months and years will shake the world at a point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines by Google will assume such proportions that the company will soon be facing the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our own health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database may offer good material for the next generation of science fiction writers, as Cory Doctorow's famous short story Scroogled describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped Ózd's double murderer cover his tracks
Police have questioned two minors in connection with the double murder of Ózd, who are suspected of helping to cover up the crime, the spokesman for the Borsod region police said on Tuesday.
The youths have pleaded guilty to their charges, and are currently being charged with aiding and abetting.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI, are defending themselves at large.
The charge of aiding and abetting is punishable by up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of multiple premeditated murders for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a construction site in Ózd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
Police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, to buy 100% of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
The Polish State owns 99% of the shares and is planning to sell more than 60% of its shares in the next few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 says that the Polish bid is the highest figure ever put forward by the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech press reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have all submitted bids so far.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all the stakeholders, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
Under the shareholders' agreement, nearly 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Česká Spořitelna Bank with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday on the international economic crisis are already talking about a "second 9/11".
The global financial disaster was caused by the US president - La Repubblica accuses - who was not able to unite his party behind a law that was passed in haste, with the aim of remedying a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbor, as billionaire super-financier Warren Buffett has said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second 9/11.
Even some of the Madrid press see Washington as a scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing more and more, and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means for the management of the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in mid-air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat is no longer to be ignored, says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some countries today can still offer a lifeline to failing financial institutions and with taxpayer money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as a domino effect then neither the financial means nor the new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must overcome their national self-interest and concentrate their control on the disintegrated financial markets.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment.
The EU has so far shown little concern about the crisis that has swept across the old continent like a tsunami.
The 'saviors' should not immediately flaunt the 100 billion euros, but it would be better if they could determine in which cases it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the flight of the stork
What better way to develop collision avoidance technologies than to mimic the sensors of obstacles found in nature?
Like the bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the seagulls gave the initial strategic input to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a mini robotic car with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
"Bees fly into their own personal oval space that really resembles our protective shield", Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and R&D, explained at the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee's eye, which is capable of a 300-degree view in any direction.
Engineers have been using the idea of laser telemetry to mimic the function of the bee's vision.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor which immediately turns it into a collision avoidance command.
In a fraction of a second, the robot senses the obstacle and then, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance, which is different from the present system, is entirely instinctive.
"If it were not for this, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility and Robotic Vehicle Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to mirror what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must be completed in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deflection cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering the wheels.
So instead of the infinite possibilities available to the bees to scan other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter and higher energy density lithium polymer batteries, which means that they last longer than lithium ion batteries.
Andoh says that the importance of the instantaneousness of the intelligent reaction is not the processing of the data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some input in a few seconds and react.
There's no need to memorize them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of kilobytes.
You don't need a gigabyte or a megabyte of memory.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for immediate collision avoidance which Nissan expects to be installed in production vehicles within 10 years.
Further possibilities of application may be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system which by avoiding the obstacles on the road leads to the destination.
They even named the baby after a very expensive
The draft of the $700 billion bailout bill for the purchase of disproportionate credit has been drafted, to be implemented in several parts.
The first step is to spend half the amount.
In new agreements extended until midnight Eastern Time Saturday, congressional leaders agreed to a $700 billion bailout plan after days of debate, Reuters reported.
We have made some serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the US House of Representatives, who said all that remained was to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, have endorsed the compromise plan.
The result of the compromise was that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the program would work and be effective, but there was still a lot of work to be done, and Pelosi said it was not about bailing out Wall Street but about reversing the economic cart.
The written version of the plan was released before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. Washington time (2 a.m. on Monday night Central European time), but it did not bring much growth to the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the bill called the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 regarding the program, then it will go to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi Saturday night, then cheerfully welcomed the news of the deal to the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, however, differs from the original Bush administration proposal, which provided that the $700 billion would all be spent on buying bonds with disproportionate credit behind them.
Now, as a first step, we can spend up to half of the $700 billion, $250 billion, immediately after the vote in Congress on Monday, with which the Treasury will buy bonds with disproportionate backing, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will be decided by the president.
A special board will oversee the program, which includes the Federal Reserve Chairman.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new act of Congress.
Under the Act, the Treasury can use a combined tactic: it can buy loans, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other types of "poisoned" loans at the same time.
The purchase can be made through auctions and directly - the ministry officials announced.
The legal provision makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Treasury Department guarantees the means to give concern, for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henry Paulson said: "The law provides the means for $700 billion to come to the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it be the purchase of the wrong financial instruments, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of a major financial institution collapsing".
We will take all necessary steps to be ready to introduce the newly signed law, he added.
The managers of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid instead think that the government will limit their goodwill, defined by overseas slang as simply golden parachutes.
Payment limitations will only occur in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys at auction, they'll impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, unless they fire the bank manager.
When the government directly purchases the disproportionate credits, it will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not overspent.
In addition, existing contracts for the Golden Parachute will not change, the restriction is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of a legal limitation on the pay of CEOs coming into force - said the measure the Democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to take a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk to taxpayers, since they can also eventually gain from it if the economy, and with it the bank rescued, will get back on its feet.
The bill includes that within the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal that provides for how to reimburse taxpayers for the anticipated losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American people have asked us to do, not to defend taxpayer dollars", said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes the measures were taken by the very people who were responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continue to rise
The Hungarian Central Statistical Institute reports that domestic industrial sales prices in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, and by 12.9% compared to August 2007.
Prices of the industry's export sales reported in July 2008 were 1,1% higher than the previous year, but decreased by 3,9%
Industrial production costs were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than a year earlier as a result of the change in domestic and export prices.
The prices of domestic industrial sales compared with the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
The prices of domestic sales in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly, by 0.1%, compared with July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in the leather and footwear processing sector (2.8%), mainly handbags and belts with 4.6% and footwear production with a 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of raw materials for plastics and chemicals caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemical products and chemicals sector.
Prices fell in the petroleum processing industry (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimal extent in the wood processing industry (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, there was a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices increased by 0.3% in August in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in gas prices effected by the authorities from 1 July.
Compared with the national sales of manufacturing industries over 12 months, the largest increases were in the manufacture of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacture of products derived from metal processing, the price increase was 13.2%, with 11% in the manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco, which account for a major share.
A decline in prices was observed in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of manufacturing industry, the rate of price increases varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices rose by 10.2% in the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector were 18.7% higher than last year.
In national sales between the target groups of sectors, the largest monthly price increase occurred in August in the sectors producing capital goods (0.7%).
In the consumer goods sectors prices increased by 0.3%, and in the energy and other utilities sectors prices were unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest price increase was observed in the energy and after-use sector (16,8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods the increase was 6.8%, for capital goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
Industrial export sales prices in guilders rose by 1.1% in August compared with the previous month, and fell by 3.9% in the 12 months to the end of the year.
The Hungarian forint within one month weakened against the euro by 1.7%, against the dollar by 7.1%, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement could come into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with local Hungarian representatives.
In his view, "now it all depends on whether the electronic entry and control system is built in time overseas".
He pointed out that the new system would no longer require an entry permit, but tourists would have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue the negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, whom he will present with the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star, and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain have also come out in support of the bailout.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the government's $700 billion plan to bail out the banks, but there are politicians calling for the Treasury secretary's resignation.
Representatives of Congress and the administration announced after days of marathon negotiations on Sunday night that they had reached an agreement in principle on the bank bailout plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to bail out the frozen bond market became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove themselves more capable than their rival in getting the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with economic issues in the forefront, Obama has regained some of his lead, while McCain's lead, gained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president, has faded.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection passages which he also supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your jobs, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He has not let it pass him by calling McCain's economic ideas obsolete.
McCain told ABC News that "we're all going to have a hard time getting this situation down... but doing nothing is not the way to go".
The Republican senator said the proposal included the creation of a committee to oversee the finance minister and the limitation of the salaries of top managers, things he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the deal, but that he was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The right-wing pole is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-conscious - so Der Spiegel analyses the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Spiegel (de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German leftist magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution Eats Up Its Own Parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian Socialists have been modernizing Bavaria for decades, and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of epoch is at the same time a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, including Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been feasible exactly ten years ago ended: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU had already fallen to 47.7%, below the 50% threshold for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, again in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
This is because of the region's consistent modernization, which is eating away at parents.
The socialists predicted this 40 years ago, but they were far wrong, but secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with the increase of possibilities and the political consequences are obvious.
The right-wing pole is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the freelancers, the craftsmen, the graduates and the graduates.
Here, support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
The press (diepresse.com) is a
In its article "The party leaders are stuck in coalition issues", the conservative Viennese daily "Wer mit wem?" deals with the confused internal political situation in Austria following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss a coalition.
The elections have been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate broadcast on public TV the party leaders have barely shown their cards.
Werner Faymann, chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can envisage a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As you stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
Repeat of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As you stated, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open matter in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, leader of the BZÖ, repeated that he was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to take the responsibility of governing", Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Equal Opportunities Summit, organised this year by France, the EU presidency, has started in Paris.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party in her message to the plenum as the main speaker of the congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
The conference was opened at the highest level by Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Mr Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the invited guests at the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil society and equal opportunities rights organisations.
The EU's new Commissioner for Education, Mr Járóka, said that the EU's new policy on education was not based on the principle of equal treatment for men and women.
"Most young Roma do not have a degree of study of average level and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a small number of them can reach a higher degree of study".
Járóka also stressed the key role of education as a fundamental human right in the promotion of human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
The Commission is also proposing a number of amendments to the directive, including a new directive on the protection of the environment.
The earlier a Roma starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through the taxes he pays on income and consumption, he contributes to the national budget.
"The right of European citizenship for Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-quality and segregated schools", said Lívia Járóka.
The Commission is also proposing to amend the directive to make it more effective in the fight against discrimination, and to make it more effective in the fight against discrimination.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe", Járóka said.
In the wake of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities' to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting is to provide a single forum to promote the anti-discrimination and equal opportunities objectives set at national and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the dismal electoral defeat, the heads of the Bavarian CSU have not yet been beheaded, and the discussion of personal matters has been postponed for the time being.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in office, the question is how long the mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic loss of 17% of the vote, will be decided at the extraordinary party congress in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it known that they are not going to be attacked with all their might.
They have so tried to soften the anger of the members of the parliamentary group and the rank and file that the day after the 'Bavaria tsunami' they demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, then at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union got 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber they have dropped to 43.4%.
The CSU has been the absolute monarch of Bavaria for 46 years, contributing 18% of German GDP.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the budgetary and financial resources for the new financial year are used to the full.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered as a possible heir of Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will start negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Voters, right-wing exponents of values, for a possible government coalition in Munich.
By a strange twist of fate in the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity of coup by the couple Huber-Beckstein and then treat without regard the woman with great ambitions.
The CSU leaders are now concentrating all their efforts to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the word 'eco-friendly' in the wording of the directive, which is to be interpreted as meaning that the directive is not binding on the Member States.
On Monday, Huber made some statements to the CSU, saying that they deserved more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be Chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 if the CSU, which played a decisive role in the national victory in 2005, is not re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide her disappointment at the fiasco, the CSU's loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
The Commission's proposals are not without their own problems.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
The President of the Republic of Moldova is the President of the Republic of Moldova.
Not a single opposition representative entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is a sign of the prosperity and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), however, it is explained by the frauds committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature of a country of 10 million people has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition grouping under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) had been hoping that Lukashenko, with his presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the controversial constitutional amendment in the 2006 elections, would "grant" some seats in parliament to opposition representatives.
The ODS thus abandoned a boycott that had been considered earlier.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a loan to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the Beltransgaz pipelines that run through the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter because of the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
The Council also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, in which it called for the immediate release of the six remaining prisoners of war.
But the OSCE's quick report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates were virtually barred from appearing in the press, and in particular that the opposition was unable to be present at the vote count.
Despite this, the opposition says that there is a noticeable improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is even willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries independent for a month already.
We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said Aleksandr Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "the authorities were afraid to let even a single opposition member into a parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to protest the results but rather tries to get the message to the voters that economic reforms are needed.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are making it difficult to distribute them, but even so I see more and more people supporting change, including among the elderly, said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the officially most helped group, the pensioners, do not think that Lukashenko's regime is adequate, considering its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security "remembers the sepulchral silence" - believes Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers judged the elections to be democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "People believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on, breakfast before work".
Never before in the history of Chigi Palace have there been rotary doors for employees to enter and exit.
But from today, this new measure against the crafty, against the one who stamps and then goes to drink coffee in the bar during working hours.
The new anti-Fannulloni legislation was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors", says Brunetta, "are a tool for better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services".
"Now a new era of accountability and transparency is opening up.
This is reformism", Brunetta emphasises.
The installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council is completed with Palazzo Chigi.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also symbolically important".
There was no resistance from the employees, the general secretary assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of everyone".
I mean, no more breakfast on business; no more coffee and cornetto.
Brunetta's words, suggesting with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand".
During a conference at the School of Public Administration
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks arising from exposure to radiation from the use of electrical energy and the use of radioactive materials is a welcome step towards the creation of a European energy policy.
He added that the public administration needed to be made more efficient.
"Their wage dynamics", explains the Minister, "have been double that of the private sector over the last 8-10 years and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined forces to challenge the Brunetta decree by joining the Codacons' appeal.
"While the Minister of Public Service today is raising the alarm about the decrease in absenteeism from work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the population of 'working drunks' is constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of honest and productive public employees in Italy have united to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree".
In particular, the TAR will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatment for sickness due to work; the extension of the hours of availability of the sick worker, within which the control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
The European Commission has recently published a report on the safety of the workplace.
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirmed that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that bear witness to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this tragic issue, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents in all the Italian provinces, which is celebrated on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is", says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of the Handicapped and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the association's constant commitment to prevention at the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"There has been, of course, a genuinely shared 'enough' of indignation at tragedies which, because of their scale, arouse the media's clamor and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide the fact that 'there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in schools for more direct awareness-raising by young people entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is necessary to keep the phenomenon in the spotlight, not to give in to alarm about its social gravity, and to apply and improve the legislative provisions.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks arising from exposure to asbestos at work is based on the principle of the protection of health and safety at work.
"The data on work accidents seem to show a slight upturn, but this does not take away from the fact that the number of white deaths is still impressive", said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not want this 'downward trend' to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is slackening that tragedy erupts.
'We believe that, in general, too little is being done to combat the phenomenon of accidents and that action can be taken in a number of ways.
We believe that more controls and inspections are needed, but also more action on the training of workers, starting with the school world.'
'Further efforts are needed in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon which represents a social emergency".
Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration in the levels of compensatory protection for victims of work" and the "welfare drift towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give back the insurance cover to the worker", he added, "so that the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneous measures or the occasional grant of money by the legislator".
Mp3 players charged, hearing is at risk
Listening to loud music for a prolonged period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
The European Commission has issued a press release in Brussels citing the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSRSERI), which was published today.
"This scientific opinion", the report says, "shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to portable music devices on a weekly basis for more than an hour a day while holding the device at a high volume, risk permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high levels of noise may be unconsciously damaging their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
'The scientific evidence shows a clear risk and we must react quickly.
More importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public domain.
We also need to review existing control systems in the light of this scientific advice to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with new technology.'
The independent scientific committee was asked by Brussels to examine the problem, given the widespread use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
'Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical instruments and related equipment.'
There is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
The damage can be greatly reduced by solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment who listen to music at a high volume (above 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week are exceeding the limits currently in force for the maximum noise permitted in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a five-year period.
This would affect 5-10% of the users of such devices and their number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
The Commission for the Future of the Capital
We start today, we close in March, we draw the tolls in June.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome", which this morning has taken up residence in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the City Council and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bulletin" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
'The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there. It will have to make proposals for an idea of the development of Rome which the political decision-makers, which are the City Council and the Junta, can then use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
It will finish its work in March and then dissolve, because this experiment must have a definite time limit.
In June, the mayor announced, "we will present the strategic plan, using the work done by the Commission for the future of Roma Capitale".
He said that the Commission was useless because its opinions would not be binding. Alemanno replied: 'Everything depends on the work the Commission is able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome too, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed by the management of the day-to-day and the emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and deeper, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
The Mayor of Rome also pointed out that 'this Commission is neither a useless body nor a dead body: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro and it will serve to reason and to involve the best minds in the capital'.
For Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit to its future".
The future, he said, "will not be confined to the present municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the context of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
A well-known American politician who wants to be independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a Web site: "This person is ambitious.
Obama has a big tough face: he thinks he's going to win the highest office in a nation that has had two black governors and five black senators!"
In reality, they are attacks that don't say much; they are attacks that are clearly racial in nature and don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president?
Again, some people speak with their heart but not with their brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the American South, wrote an editorial: Once in the voting booth we know for whom the American patriot will cast his vote.
It's a side of the American mind that's been kept covered up to the very last.
"Say what you want, and then we'll figure out where to put the croissant, whether it's on Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before now, that seem almost certain the black candidate's success.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people, what were the mistakes Bush made during his presidency? 89 percent said Iraq.
Change the U.S.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicked in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans didn't have to pack.
Yet, Iraq was for the most part Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes over from George W will have a huge job to do.
In the US, the economic downturn is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control as it relates to the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of the economic model destroyed.
And the cuts in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the papers together, is a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as understood by the general public to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that journalism nationwide is going in the wrong direction.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed versus broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
Major publishing houses are opening up the Internet, seen by many as the "killer" of printed matter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the people who run the newsrooms -- the editors -- and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives nationally are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some it has to do with "job security".
Executives who expect to lose their jobs within three years are at 47% nationally.
For the staff reporters, it's 30%.
Staff-level "safe work" is always on the agenda in America.
Only 13% of journalists work on contract.
In a huge country like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it".
Editors are almost always paid a large salary, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
The reasoning for the holidays is complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third year, to arrive at a total of 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their own admission, get sick a lot during the year.
It's all about the weather.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment in the event of a fire.
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his hometown, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under bankruptcy investigation as part of the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl countercontract.
During the trial against him last week, he obtained the release from house arrest, which was converted into a residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
But the court said that these moves (against which the PM opposed) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence against him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon was already manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
As the New York Times reported yesterday, the current crisis is tearing the Republican Party apart, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, pro-federal institutions and the business community, and its new, conservative soul, hostile to Washington and the financial world, strong especially in the Midwest and South.
The soul, in fact, which came to life with the power of the vow I mentioned at the beginning.
The above mentioned example is only one example of the changes, the great changes, which the current economic earthquake is perhaps foreshadowing or already revealing: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not only here.
In the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator of long-in-cubed phenomena which in the new climate are solidifying and are finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of State-sovereignty in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have close links with the rest of the world, but which primarily affect the balance sheets of individuals and families living in a single country, a single State.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those individuals and families who, by the way, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of the game or to have little to say: the glaring proof is given by the European Union, which is divided as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies and is unable to decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the disbursement of funds: since when it comes to the narrowing it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things right.
And they have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, under certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organization can ever have at its disposal in an analogous way.
This new emphasis on the national status element in the crisis is in perfect harmony with the growing importance which the latest economic developments tend to attach to a factor closely linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, at the same time that we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, at the same time that we were convinced that globalized finance was destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to deal, instead, to an increasing extent with those very few immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All the things that, look at it, can be transported from one place to another on the earth but are still absolutely bound to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So that those who happen to be sovereign, certainly have a lot more cards than those who are not, who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second piece of news, which, however, presages a break.
When you say territory, state, government, you inevitably mean politics, and therefore leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for someone who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, especially economic, which has been shown to be inadequate and full of shadows.
And together with something even more profound and in some ways disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems that in large sectors of the population, the belief is gaining ground that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites up to now, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, have had their time and are increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, is feeding underground a widespread but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which is manifested in the sudden electoral revolutions or the sudden turns of collective mood of these last and very recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the labor consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats, as some might say, are finding it increasingly difficult to understand and therefore to represent what is taking shape in the deepest layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, increasing, agitating potentially to the limit.
In the face of all this, to talk about a "mass uprising" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is not at all.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Defying the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future, walking on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close.
With a mere one-and-a-half-inch-square adhesive, scholars were able to glue a 300-pound [100 kg] body to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing materials that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists drew inspiration from gecko feet, which are covered with microscopic hairs that ensure that the animal is perfectly adherent.
Tests on a variety of materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time"it easily detaches from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use, like connecting electronics, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at this point.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also working on a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a hair-like microfibre adhesive that self-cleans from dust when moving on a surface to maintain perfect adhesion at all times.
Medicines: never with fruit juices
Watch out for the grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they quench thirst and are rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as certain life-saving medicines alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with serious consequences for health.
The European Commission has recently published a report on the use of the term 'medical' in the context of the European Union's action in the field of health and safety at work.
Grapefruit juice had already come under fire for being responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs to levels believed to be toxic.
The Italian Medicines Agency itself announced the news in a newsletter two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mix and to be careful what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
Not just apple juice - Experts say that orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit medication.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may take steps to change the information notes on medicines.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not be impressed but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification" the expert stressed to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman
The Nobel prize for economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of trade patterns and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most vocal critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days of the Enron meltdown, Krugman predicted in an editorial in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of the consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked controversy and was ridiculed by the economist for years, but which has now been proven correct.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public's attention", Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value, but also a publicist with a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more popular Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, supported by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the revised interface and made less spartan, other more substantial ones are added such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some of the specific features of some modules are interesting, such as the ability to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by e-mail, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphic processing module, while preserving the original appearance of the page.
On this front, "hybrid PDF" documents can be created, combining the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, you can intervene several times between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud), and should release the final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that was on the mirrors on Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace on request.
And if the topic of free can be a drag for the diffusion in the homes, it is precisely in the business environment that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, being able to already count on several projects realized in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of organisations offering training, advice and support services which are ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, and which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the Powerpoint emulo presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are now at almost 3,600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also a positive test subject . He 's the fourth doping case .
A new positive event at the last Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third in the standings and winner of the best climber jersey.
The news is reported by the website of the daily newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth rider to win the Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples are consistent with those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms Cera's positive, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and face two years of canonical disqualification.
The news of Kohl's third-generation Epo positive comes from the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive.
The 26-year-old Austrian climber finished on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber's jersey.
The EU has also been criticized for its lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law.
Italy "has only recently transformed itself from a country of emigrants into a preferred destination for immigrants" who are reluctantly welcomed.
Is this turning Belpaese into a nation of racists? is what is asked in a long article in the New York Times which has dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of the young Burkinabe Abdul William Guibre who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time the ones where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Lega Nord".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited the intolerance episodes in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just that.
The new legislation pushed by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
This trend was emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students who are victims of the caro-rent up to 900 euro per room
The market for college rentals is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the union of tenants, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now become so serious that entire groups of young people are excluded from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear", explains the head of Sunia's studies office, Laura Mariani. "In these cities, the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that it has triggered a process of generalized increase even for residents".
In most cases, the lease offers contain a series of infringements: free-type contracts, unregistered, without a limit to the rent, linked sub-leases.
The Commission has also taken the view that the measures proposed by the Italian authorities are not sufficient to achieve the objective of the common market.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a place in the Brianza area, about 450 euros are needed; for a single room it ranges from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the university, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome, in areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) single rooms cost about 600 euros, and double rooms 450 euros.
Only slightly lower values (550 euro for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The only savings are in the outlying areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single bed in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, and a room costs between 400 and 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
A Bari for a bed place requires 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller towns prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the town economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-EU students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% in the fee charged to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema paradise, cities are canceling the historic halls
The old movie theaters are closing in favor of multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes".
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively captures what is happening in the major Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalizing the cinema, with the birth in the peripheries of the large multiplexes and the consequent death by consumption of the single screens in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem inescapable and incontrovertible to us but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
"It's like losing a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of the road and many emotions", observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film which won Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury twenty years ago, and which told the story of a provincial cinema hall and nostalgia for a way of living cinema that was perhaps lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main exhibitors' association, speak plainly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed their doors, and the biggest losers are mainly the cinemas in the main cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected by the closures were Emilia-Romagna with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to prove that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new multiplex cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
The Italian business has developed irrationally, says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "It is useful to build new structures but it is necessary to guarantee the survival of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its patrons are willing to move to the multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of funds for the fund for the trainers: the state's pre-debit is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the existing laws.
The sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year to support it.
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run for cover with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-screen cinemas both in the historic center and in the periphery.
The rules include tax relief for operators and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking and in some car parks.
"It's an initiative I like", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope other cities will follow Bologna's example and put other measures in place.
To counter the overwhelming power of multiplexes, traditional theaters must also improve the quality of sound and picture, for today's audiences are more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale on the now closed Via Nazionale, where I've lived so many shared emotions, I turn the other way to avoid seeing the black boards covered in dust.
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the choices of the municipality with the interests of the leg Piromalli".
The accusations that the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria are directing to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for outside competition in a mafia association, are heavy.
Also in custody is Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, the lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted of association for mafia-style crime, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense", the prosecutors write, the two local governments had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Piromalli's lawyer.
"The council would thus be allowed", the judges write, "to officially enter the municipalities, thus facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional council, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "there are several collusions between local authorities and organized crime" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean".
The arrests this morning follow those last July, when the police announced that they had beheaded Piromalli.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for presumed conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of Udc at the time of its dissolution, had been elected leader of a centre-right coalition following the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted into a frenzy when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the town council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having designed everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli gang had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the PM, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy comes from the waves, now the big guys are coming out.
It is an unknown deposit, occupying over 70 percent of the planet's surface, and it is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable resources that they've got their eyes on, and now they're trying to get their hands on, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now and in the 1970s, at the same time as the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now environmental concerns and the new oil surge are giving the sector a boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity demand could be met by offshore wind turbines.
This would be twice as much as is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there'd be tides and currents.
Colossians to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies are betting on marine energy, and these companies have always been committed to conventional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies", a spokesman for a subsidiary of the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the start of a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a sign of something, especially when you consider that it is in Alaska that the United States continues to extract oil and that President Bush recently launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are pursuing the path of energy from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate a growing interest, according to observers.
Technology to be refined.
Experts say the technology is still in its infancy, not least because marine energy is not the only source of environmental concern.
So far, plants like the one in Portugal or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to cause major problems for the ecosystem.
However, large-scale energy production requires the use of technologies with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure drives a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
Right now, there are four of these plants in the pipeline, waiting for federal approval only, and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water at high tide turns the turbine blades, creating a rotating motion that powers a generator.
La Verdant said he has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary permits to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, say the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, is the potential of tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves and is therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that face the coast, have already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and are planning investments of up to 35 million for 2009.
