The right-wing populists in Austria are winning, they have 29 percent overall
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria have brought about a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a marked strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the other hand, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthia Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the national political scene.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain the country's leading political force with 29.8 percent of the vote, but compared to the 2006 elections they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost almost nine percent of the vote, finished even worse.
This is the worst result of the two major parties since the war, and the result is literally catastrophic, especially for the People's Party, which called early elections.
Back in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
But the voters clearly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the party leader and current Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer was pronounced.
Observers believe this could happen as soon as Monday, at the extraordinary party leadership council.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP grand coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) reportedly gaining 18 percent and the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - the Socialists at the same time expressed fear of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time, the FPÖ was still unified, the BZÖ split from it in 2005) on a joint government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already said he was ready to work with any party and that he planned to return to Vienna on the national political scene, is apparently betting on this development.
The last party to gain access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
Clearly, no other party has crossed the four percent threshold and entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India at risk of cooling
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India of illegally collecting cockroaches is not resolved, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, the result would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this today in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem is not solved, then yes, a certain cooling-off would happen", he said after the meeting, which was organised on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, coming out of the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
He did, however, mention that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was cleared of the charges and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, as the case was placed under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He said he could then apply for bail and await trial in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same view during the talks.
"He advises appealing to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned", says the Czech diplomat.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with 'competent legal support', the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been given by India.
"We wish above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomology.
'We consider the imprisonment and indictment of these Czech researchers a big mistake,' he said.
The minister avoided the question whether he had obtained a promise from India to take care of the matter.
"I have already received a fairly large number of promises", he merely states.
A Czech referee in the fight for the seabed
He approaches an electronic wall map, showing Australia and the surrounding marine areas.
But he is not interested in the continent, but in a little dot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is as big as the continent itself", says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and the completion from time to time.
The atmosphere is one of hard work and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a world that is so far unknown and rich in natural resources.
It may contain oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also unknown living organisms that may hold the key to the development of a drug for cancer.
A depth wider than the dry land
The coastal states have now begun to crave new underwater territories with impassioned fervor.
They are exercising their rights under a UN convention, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
The latter can, according to the convention, claim exclusive claim to all the resources of the continental shelf.
'To simplify, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles which constitute the exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question makes to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly surveys and surveys.
It is the result of years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far only the last three countries have been successful", adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, as the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions, has recently received worldwide attention.
New Zealand has also gained territory - the area of the seabed, which the commission estimated last week to be 1.6 million square kilometers, is six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they expect to derive from the exploitation of the seabed in the future will be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will apply in turn.
They can do so within 10 years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, a conventionally declared "common heritage of mankind".
There is no longer any state in an exclusive position.
The right to extract in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"But let us not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike", says Mikulka, exaggerating, adding that "its areas are clearly defined and their regime is based on a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc countries in the framework of the joint organization Interoceanmetal.
It was granted the status of so-called 'pioneer investor' under the Convention in 1991, along with investors from a few other States.
It has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area envisaged by the investor is slightly larger than the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rough, it's like a replica of the Tatra Mountains underwater.
"It is possible to mine in an area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives an example of this.
It reminds me of a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene to free the hostages.
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but they never went into action.
More and more details are coming out about the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, specialists from the Federal Army, officials from GSG 9, the Federal Air Police Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were present at the liberation site.
As the Ministry spokesman announced on Monday evening, German forces were not required, as the hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it as a supporting force.
"Fortunately, it has not come to that", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped a group of tourists in southern Egypt, consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian tourists accompanying them.
After being kidnapped in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained unclear, as have the details of their release or possible ransom payments.
Those rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
At the moment, no information has been given in Berlin on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five vacationers and the special forces are expected to have taken off on an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout plan.
The lower house of Congress has narrowly defeated a $700 billion bailout of the financial markets.
The Dow Jones was plunging into the abyss.
By a vote of 227 to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan in favor of the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program to stem the chaos in the financial markets failed to gain a majority.
In a dramatic move, the supporters had desperately tried to convince opponents of the validity of the massive $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debate, had called on the House to vote in favor of the plan even though it was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened", he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones was down by over six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan might backfire.
He rose again shortly before the end of the vote, only to fall again after the announcement of his defeat.
Experts now project further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to come into force, the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate is required.
Organisers report increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to one study, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the thirst for travel among Germans remains insatiable, according to the study.
As for winter bookings, travel agencies saw a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period last year, the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) said in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey by the GfK market research institute, increasing booking figures already dominate the autumn months.
The sales figure would thus have risen to about 11 percent more than in 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are figures from GfK, which analyses monthly booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
The low dollar value would make travel to the United States particularly popular, the VDR said.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey, Greece and our country would be particularly popular destinations for Germans.
The demand for organised trips is particularly high, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food, the costs here would be "easier to calculate for the customer than for an individually arranged trip".
Consumers can save money with discounts on advance bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months were also very limited, so sales figures will again increase compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in pint-sized pitches and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
It's an event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, a TV host and wears a custom Tyrolean suit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes into the beer party, and already the photographers are jumping up on us and filling out their memory cards - very flattering, and that's on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean suit seems to be achieving its purpose.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the equator in Weißwurst, my sense of well-being in traditional costume was limited until now.
But once you're in Place Thérèse, everything's half as bad.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks sullen or ashamed - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean suit gets a few strange glances at the chocolate banana stand.
A Bavarian woman remarked that I had tied my apron wrong: "left means free, middle virgin, right side cassava, back widow".
I'm discreetly tripping my locket from the back to the left.
"It's better", she said, laughing.
Others do not bother with these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple signs that say "Too drunk to get dressed!" and expose their naked buttocks without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is Bob, he's from England and he's coming to the beer party for the first time.
He thinks it's gorgeous, with an "ooooo" stretched out.
He tells me all this after he's relieved of the booze he drank before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild peepers".
Others are not so fortunate to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, a gang of rescue workers rushed into the party square to care for the poor drunkards.
Instead, the nurses work in packs - always four of them, dragging their stretcher covered with tents from tent to tent.
This is how it works for most beer party visitors: you go empty, you come back full.
Those who lie in the coffin of the drunk under the blanket are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't swallow anything anymore", one of the rescuers shouted in response to my question and then disappeared into the fray.
Police identify accident victim
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon in the town centre on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been out on bail since.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, European powers were eager to invade its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 paces from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each corner, like some German provincial town halls.
The rocks are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the arched ticket office, we have no doubt about the greatness of the enterprise, which represents a gateway to the West.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was lagging behind in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination with this railway that reaches Damascus, Baghdad and the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, brought about by the icy frontiers of the Cold War, is over.
The British and Imperial forces advanced beyond Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling into ruin, engulfed in the maze of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to underline Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, brought about by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now it is time for a new policy of engagement.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car heading to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10.5-hour journey, rocking on noisy rails with a rhythm reminiscent of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new century-old state, turning its back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He was suspicious of the West, and Washington in particular.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and many bakeries where middle managers in suits and ties - men and women - meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Suit, tie, and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its own country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
Neither of them were.
She had to do both.
But at a certain point, I asked if Turkey should choose.
"Turkey", he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two".
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I spoke to has memorized: the Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to be a Europe travelling metaphorically on the tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought back to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that European ambitions in the Middle East could, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry across the Bosphorus, I remembered the time when Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us in our 20s refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to handle any type of music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this was thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants".
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His baton technique was absolutely clear, precise, though never dictatorial or apparent.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should be knighted, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982 when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years, I've seen over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me - and, on occasion, they even inspired me.
Tod Handley was so rarely a combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, "focused on certain people".
He will be missed by many.
I'm not going to tell you.
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while pursuing a BSc, MA and PhD".
That's what came out of a letter from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and was at the same time completing a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and '51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Houblon, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition 'Flamenco and life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
I was attracted to them because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
It's an exhibition that conveys a lot of emotion.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments".
Second strike for Honda's sales record
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
While its predecessor had good seating, the new minivan has even more interior space.
In addition, some refined mechanics make driving more comfortable and fuel-efficient.
It's an evolution against a revolution.
So this is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line to the previous model, there are many changes introduced in this minivan.
Among them are an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before we look at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation was launched.
Firstly, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, it is a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
For example, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz cars since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish branch hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will enable Honda to make up for the fall in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand's managers expect to end the year with sales of 22,000 cars, that is, 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a fall in sales of 16%.
This increase in sales has led Honda to increase its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also expects to achieve a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
The Insight is a compact, five-door hybrid - 4.37-metre-long - that the Japanese company hopes to sell nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be in the United States, while the other half will be split between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned in the first three months of next year, following its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz is larger in size.
Its length is 3.90 meters (an additional five centimeters), its width 1.69 meters (an additional two centimeters), and its distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remains the same - 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and so does the interior space.
This increase is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the boot - which has a double bottom system  can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation boot.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior features such as rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improved access to the rear seats.
The doors to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared with the rear doors of the first Jazz, which opened at an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation Jazz.
When it first goes on sale, this small model will be equipped with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology which reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2 litre engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz had 78 horsepower - consumes 5.3 litres of petrol per 100 km and emits 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L 100 horsepower has a combined fuel consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 kilometers and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, especially bees.
A Japanese company has created a robot that mimics the flight of bees to prevent accidents.
It's called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and it's the first step toward collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technology Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the general manager of public relations for technology and brand management research and development, the BR23C represents the rise of Nissan's safety shield.
This robot will allow the brand's vehicles to prevent collisions.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But most important are the bees' compound eyes, which can see in an angle of over 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing them to fly uninterrupted within their own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles within a two-meter radius, calculates the distance to the object, and immediately sends a signal to the microprocessor to avoid the obstacle.
"The minute it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forking its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid a collision.
The biggest difference from any other system in existence is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and lead engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it to do, not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device has to process information and act on that data.
It doesn't need to retain information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
It may be surprising, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes".
This represents the first car to develop new instantaneous collision avoidance technologies, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in about ten years after Nissan.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and longer lasting than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be to adapt this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be admitted that the US Treasury, besides having plenty of cash to make plans, is not without genius.
To avoid the risk of Americans going into debt, they created a game to help them avoid bankruptcy: Bad Credit Hotel.
It means "the hotel of bad credit" or stories.
The gloomy appearance of this apartment and especially the owner of the hotel makes us think repeatedly if this is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
I'm sure this game gives us useful information but not much detail.
It's more of a teenage game.
What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley is opening up its capital to MUFG.
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, into its roundtable, which will pay out $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a news welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after unveiling a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a price of $25.25 per share, for a total of $3 billion.
The price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional USD 6 billion in the acquisition of convertible bonds with a 10% yield and a conversion price of USD 31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, which is 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley's share, however, was down 6.79% to $23.07 at around 5pm GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status", said John Mack, the group's US chief executive.
Morgan Stanley passed this new charter last week, which should allow it to diversify its operations but bring it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: on Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago", explained Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG in Tokyo, "we thought that the participation would be entirely made up of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise the risks and cover ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares within one year if the latter are traded more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at about USD 47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley believes that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to give details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier 1 solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "significantly" reduced its balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been a tough one for the group, as its stock price has fallen by half as the cost of default insurance on its debt has soared.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Rebuild the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he was the third to vote on a draft new constitution.
Mission accomplished, with 64% of voters voting 'yes' in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" vote was 28%, 7% of the votes were void and 0.7% were white.
For the draft constitution to pass, he had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a count by a non-governmental organization showed a large "yes" victory, with between 63% and 70% voting.
Rafael Correa had claimed victory in the night from Sunday to Monday for his draft Constitution.
"The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly", he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
As a matter of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was conducted in a calm manner according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, was on a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft constitution devotes the state's power over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives mainly on the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by its emigrants.
The bill, which was introduced by Correa in 2006, also gives the head of state greater powers, allowing him to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and run for another term in February 2009.
The Constitution also reinforces the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to implement in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a launching point for US anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando unit launched an assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
The hostages, who appeared to be in good condition, arrived at about 3:30 p.m. on a special plane at the al-Maza military base, which is adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, unable to speak to the press, by helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, said Egypt's Tourism Minister, Zoheir Garanna, on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been rocked from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, which organises the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces, accompanied by two helicopters, launched the attack in the night just before dawn.
"There was a gun battle, and half the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled", said the official, who asked not to be identified.
He said that a total of 150 Egyptian special forces from the Lightning unit had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by Italian secret agents and special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence and special forces", he said, without elaborating.
He also denied that a ransom could be paid.
The day before, the Sudanese army said it had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers during a patrol, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying this election campaign.
- That's good. - Thank you.
But one aspect of our cultural life is still being forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the meager sums of money being given to small museums, archives, archaeological digs, or starving national historic sites?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have any real laws that actually protect our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, it is written in their country's constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the American culture and that heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and that in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogical societies are concerned with digging up history, preserving three-quarters of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and policymakers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a grandstand for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux countries are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, the first European bank to be in difficulty following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it.
This weekend the Belgian, Luxembourgish and Dutch governments reached agreement at the highest level on this matter, also using the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
The first major crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been escalating for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three countries will buy back almost half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital in each country.
The Bank will undoubtedly sell some of its holdings, including, first of all, the mainly insurance business which it acquired last year from the Dutch company ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a dizzying fall, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis were already revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company's stock fell 12 percent, to its lowest level in 14 years.
Since January, the stock has fallen by more than two-thirds of its value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's management, is not realistic.
The company's management blames the uncertainty on the other side of the Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US $700 billion bailout plan, for the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the paper had already seen a slight rise.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers but has not yet received a proposal on the substance.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors should not worry, they will not lose their money.
No panic was felt among the bank's clientele and no branch was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate based on information about his purchases of medication.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There are data protection schemes which require the use of information on prescription medicines in all cases to be subject to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, or it's like handing a chicken coop to a fox", said Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions for medications.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the capital insurance in case of damage depend on the health condition of the customer who presents himself, and if they consider the risk too great, they do not even insure him.
In the past, they would send candidates for medical examination, and they would only sign insurance contracts with them after they had read the results.
In the last ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he can easily obtain from pharmacies data on the person's purchases of medicines in the last 18 months.
For example, if that person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of this programme in circulation, some of which determine a risk factor at the same time, so there is little left for the insurer to do but paperwork, but there may still be some minor problems.
One of the disadvantages of this program is that a drug can be used for different purposes, for example, some mixtures can be used for migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers to be an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in research and data analysis, and they have to ask the patient's permission before they can collect the necessary information from the pharmacy.
Now they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their past transgressions.
Recently, some companies have also processed laboratory test results and linked them to data on drug use, thus being able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time it is becoming increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to broaden the scope of the authorities' scrutiny of companies specialising in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard recognises that this is not enough and has therefore developed his programme even further, which would make the transfer of data subject's exclusive consent conditional.
It is another matter whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
So, in the end, chickens depend on the kindness of the fox.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
As the EU and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other issues, largely global.
Today there will also be a France-India summit, where cooperation on atomic energy will be the main topic.
The European Union recognises that India is a major emerging democratic power which should be given a wider say in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi's candidacy for permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
The Commission has not yet decided on the date of the meeting.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the European Union, together with Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Foreign Minister Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and agreed that within five years they would double their trade, which would mean an increase of more than 100 billion euros.
This does not seem too ambitious, considering that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion.
In this respect, they have harmonized legally the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation, which will also allow air trade to grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009 at the latest.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's largest trading partner, and New Delhi, the EU's ninth largest trading partner.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as were all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on the subject was mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to the energy and climate agenda, including its aim to reduce its emissions of toxic substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that a global market should be reached at the climate conference next year, and greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent food prices from rising and supported the convening of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is visiting the French capital today, where he is preparing to sign a bilateral agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement is for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
A large number of Italian publishers were present at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries to occupy the 171,790 square metres of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display, with Turkey as guest of honour.
The Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, at the opening ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
The meeting will be followed by a press conference in Room Struktur, Butterfly 5.0 at the Buchmesse, an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects for the position of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing in relation to total Italian production, and in particular in relation to that for adults and children.
We found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who went missing a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, no human remains, though.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson has dispelled any remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is indeed the one that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared", he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or near the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead.
The US Transportation Safety Board (TSB) said that within hours of the wreckage being located, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft as the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were found by a couple outside their Mammoth Lakes home.
There are two documents in Fosset's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was stopped a month after she disappeared.
The billionaire had earned a place in history through a long string of records.
On his sixth attempt, in 2002, he became the first man to complete a two-week solo circumnavigation of the globe in a hot air balloon.
Three years later, he had flown around the world nonstop.
Among all these records, there was also the record of flying over the Andes at 15,445 meters, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
An unusual four-wheel drive with a distinctive design, sharp lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
In summary, this is the GLC, the latest of the star's off-road "compacts" with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to bring a new spirit to the sector.
It is precisely because of its unconventional, unexpected and unconventional content that the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
The hype that will accompany the launch of the new car will thus give rise to a new mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi display units, divided into three phases, will dominate the heart of Milan's shopping district, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication involves the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in near-real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
It will seem that the car is not on the billboard.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new GLK will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then reassembled into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of car communication.
Will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers with this formula?
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? they are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and that, until now, had never caused any major problems.
Neither had ever clashed with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolor flags with their hometown on them. On Saturday night, they were all taken away to avoid identification.
They're inspired by the English fanfare.
In Bulgaria, they found a real Nazi fan club, the Levski.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the criminal had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, were not eligible for a ticket, and could not travel.
Now the criminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then will take action: in this case, it may be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the riots will serve a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits the use of Italian stadiums, but also European ones.
In short, our hooligans will never set foot in the stadium again.
Thank God for that.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that means that others may be added to the top 150.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize whoever behaves like this", says Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for the national team game on Wednesday in Lecce"
In Puglia there is a small core of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the CASMS which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say secret services, which deal with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the outstretched arm during the Mameli anthem?
This is the opinion (expressed in a very unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took over from Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect in Trieste, where a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise Mussolini, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhus was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the Observatory's No. 1, "crimes must be attributed to the country in which they occur.
So far, this group has been within the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to the Mameli anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you'll excuse me, they are not polite...
