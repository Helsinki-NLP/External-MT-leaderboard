Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricanes to a home victory in the opening game , a second win for Savo Volley .
Hurricanes-Loimaa, who have won seven consecutive men's volleyball Champions League medals, started the 2018-19 season with a home win as Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, a full-back who returned to Finland from Romania, was the Hurricanes' most effective player with 22 points.
There were some tunings overseas, but they didn't happen, and then there was a call from Loima.
It was pretty quick to get things settled, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tom Rumpenen, who played in Loimou, supported Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team's striker Samuli Kaislasalo, who played with a match-by-match agreement, with 17 points.
A win in the opening game is always important.
Many of the players had experience on the other side, and that added to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the goal is to continue the medal pipeline, Kouki said.
I 'm gonna make you the most powerful Savoy Volley .
Miro Määttänen was the most effective at 18 points in Savo Volley when the team defeated the Vieremä Vantaana Ducks 3-0.
We had a shaky game, especially on the offensive line, but luckily we got the win.
"I didn't have any consciously different charge when I played against my old team", said Määttänen.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 2000-01 season in the third division of the Vliegball der Nähe, scored 12 points.
Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with a lot of things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was on the ceiling all the time.
A good one left at the opening.
Miro was a monk, Sillik played a good game, said Tuovinen.
Siltalo's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in the Pielavede Sammo with Tuovinen as head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' top scorer with 14 points.
♪ I'm going to make you a star ♪
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league's points in the 2012-13 season, has started this season strongly.
The starter scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley took their season opener after beating the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started off well for me.
Today, we were close to losing, but we were in the fourth round, 17-21.
They dug up a draw somewhere, and the fifth round came along, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' most effective hitter in the playoffs was Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
The compatriot, Alexander Kudryachov, was the winner with 17 points.
We barely got a hold of the guy's hack, Mikkonen said.
Finland is ranked first in the world in terms of human capital
Finland is the world's leading country in human capital, reports the science journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital between 1990 and 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries have been compared.
In both years Finland was the first in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Finland was previously followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one higher, and Taiwan was replaced on the list.
In 2016, the worst performing countries in comparison were Niger and South Sudan.
The human capital measure looks at the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has identified the relationship between human capital and economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, the home game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was in the starting lineup, and the Madrid team's home game ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Antoine Griezmann of Atletico Madrid and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian goalkeeper Courtois was able to fight back.
Courtois played three seasons for Atletico on loan at Chelsea.
Earlier this week, the International Football Federation named him the Goalkeeper of the Year.
In Real, Gareth Bale was the top scorer, but his shot missed the goal at the end of the first half.
Bale was forced to sit out the season due to a leg injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of the scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, who has moved to Juventus.
The United States is now under attack for abortion rights - a powerful document explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently considering whether to nominate Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump, as one of the nine justices to the Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
The documentary Reversing Roe - America and Abortion Rights, directed by Rick Stern and Annie Sundberg, shows how the present situation has come about over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the subject is also relevant in Finland.
The Foreign Minister, Mr Timo Soini (sin), has been campaigning against safe abortion and has received a large majority of the Members of Parliament's support.
The powerful documentary begins with Colleen McNicholas, a gynecologist who, due to the extortion laws, has become the only doctor in Missouri to perform abortions.
An armed guard at the clinic says he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
The news videos are reminiscent of the deadly terrorist attacks on the clinics.
Let's go back to the days when abortion was illegal in the United States.
The Lutheran Churchmen's Association at that time directed women to reliable abortion doctors.
The pastor's argument is good, but in fact, it's not even necessary, just a photo of the woman who died in the abortion she performed.
The death rate in the United States was about 5,000 a year.
The Republican Party in particular advocated legalizing abortion.
Back in 1967, the California Abortion Rights Act was signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, in his presidential campaign of 1980, Reagan in particular began to reversely mix religion with politics in order to win voters.
His successor, George Bush Sr., also had an abortion.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document reaches the very heart of the matter by seeking the basis for the politicization of abortion.
When pro-racial religious organizations were denied tax breaks, they became politically active.
The choice of the stallion was abortion.
Religion has brought extraordinary ties to politics.
As I write this, the United States is in a situation where a president who has boasted about sexual harassment but has captured the voices of the religious right with his abortion ring has nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, whom many women now accuse of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh could be given the power to decide, based on his Wa'a language status, the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, at a major border rally.
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired on protesters in the border area.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that two children, a boy of 12 and a boy of 14, were among the dead.
The Ministry of Defense says 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and conducted an air strike on the border area as protesters threw rocks and explosives at Israeli forces.
The army says it's beginning to use force to prevent protesters from breaking down the border fence or pushing it across.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests along the border.
The number of wounded is 12,000, according to the UN human rights commissioner.
The protesters demanded that Palestinian families be allowed to enter the areas that Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by Israeli leopards and helium balloons from the Palestinian side have set fire to Israeli forests and farmland.
Teemu Ducky got a penalty kick . He didn 't get to shoot himself .
Wigan's top man, Chey Dunkley, appeared to knock him out with a punch from behind in the penalty area.
The referee, Gavin Ward, has allowed the game to continue.
His interpretation was that the stabbing was clean.
Old Guy couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left to the discomfort of the referee, Ward, who gave Norwich a penalty kick in the 85th minute, when the Puck was sent off.
Ward showed a penalty kick, and Mario Vrancic scored the winning goal.
Guy has scored five goals for Norwich in the Champions League.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR with a classy chest muscle.
Daddy liked his job again.
After the ball was lost, he continued to the end.
He was a goal scorer and a tireless defender.
It was the fifth game for Norwich in two weeks.
The team is going to the League Cup.
There's a five-win pipe in the back.
Pedophiles' help desk filled immediately after booking - In Finland, about 40,000 children are being cared for
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small number of women have at least some sexual interest in prepubescent girls.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult to get help for those who are sexually interested in children or young people.
A joint project between the Crime Support Foundation and Sexpo, SeriE, trains professionals to deal with pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, a flood of e-mails and appointments were quickly completed at Sexpo, which provides counselling and therapy, Yle says.
But they promise to release them in the fall.
Sexual preference for children is a source of shame for many.
Most of those who have experienced paedophilic feelings have not lived out their fantasies and thus have not committed any criminal acts.
But a liking is usually a permanent trait.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Yelle sex therapist Patricia Thesleff, a specialist on the project.
I think the work is worthwhile if one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
The Korean leaders or the Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound strange at first, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites for the prize, based on the odds.
In the background is Trump's role in getting North Korea to commit to denuclearization, at least in terms of talks.
The biggest contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize are reportedly South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and pledged to pursue a peace treaty between their countries.
The warming between the Koreas is remarkable, since last year things were good.
Yet, the award of Kim, who has been threatening nuclear weapons for years and leading the country with an iron fist, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced starting Monday, and Friday will be the most highly-regarded, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those who have contributed to diplomacy on the Korean peninsula, one of the top candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of victims of gang rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become the world's leading expert in his field.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, a chronic byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that this year's prize is up for 331 nominations.
The names of the candidates are not made public.
Trump himself wouldn't hurt if he got the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Everybody thinks so, but I would never say that myself", Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
"The prize I want is a victory for the whole world", the president continued, referring to the North Korean negotiations.
But there are factors that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multifaceted world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as opposed to.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three U.S. politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So, to award Trump, the Nobel Committee would have to make a complete ideological shift.
Fire alarm in the tunnel: drivers behaving like a deal and driving in the wrong direction
The traffic jam on Route One occurred on September 8.
Traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in both Turku and Helsinki directions as a result of the announcement.
When it was discovered that there was a system failure, the fire department tried to get traffic back to normal.
But it didn't work out that fast.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Center said that it could not be opened because there are so many motorists on the road and they drive as they please, the daytime fire chief Pasi Kääriäinen told STT.
The highway was then set to go in the wrong direction after just a moment's waiting.
When the first one starts to violate traffic rules, a few others often follow, Tapio Heiskanen, the liaison officer for traffic safety, is amazed.
According to traffic rules, you can't stop on the motorways or tunnels unless you have a compelling reason.
Transport Safety reminds us that in an emergency situation, we cannot risk the traffic by taking hasty decisions.
The warning vehicles shall always be allowed to pass as freely as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as is making a U-turn and reversing.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels, where the headlamps must also be switched on at all times.
It is also forbidden to stop without a compelling reason, as is, of course, parking.
Recently, there have even been cases of a driver stopping in a tunnel to brush the snow off his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, says Heiskanen in a press release from the Transport Safety Board.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue the party even though the boat was stuck at the bottom of the lake.
Ilves fans who were transported by the inland waterway M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory celebration, even though the ship had been caught in the lake bed by its keel, says Juho Syrjä, who acted as the captain of the ship at the time of the incident.
The M/S Tampere, en route from the port of Hämeenlinna to Tampere, derailed late on Saturday evening and was caught in the bottom of the Old River in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members aboard the ship were evacuated overnight to the mainland.
No one was hurt in the accident.
"The fans of Ilves would have liked to continue their celebration on the boat until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them by fire station ride to the port and then by bus home", Syrja told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinnan watching the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 victory for Ilves.
According to the local news agency, the reason for the hail on Saturday was that the water level in the Vanya water was about half a meter lower than normal.
Navigation was also hampered, according to Syrja, by the fact that the nearest road sign was covered by logs, so that its reflectors were not normally visible on a dark bridge.
Not to mention a collision .
The accident occurred on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalme shortly after the shipping route had crossed the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The incident was not particularly dramatic, Syrja said, since the ship was traveling at a very low speed at the time and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to the report, the capture of the ship has not caused any leaks or weights and the ship's cruises will continue as normal.
A diver came in Saturday morning to check the ship's condition before the boat was towed off the shore.
We're going to the shipyard to make sure there's no damage, Sirja says.
Syrja believes that the next cruise to M/S Tampere, booked for next weekend, can be arranged.
He says the cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No need for ambulances
The emergency services received a tip-off about the incident just after 12:30 Saturday night.
Ambulance services were called to the Vial port to receive the evacuated passengers, but they were not needed.
Our friend, Fire Chief Matti Willman, told us late last night that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and the rather strong wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue agency said at 2:30 p.m. the night before Sunday that all aboard had been evacuated and passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The ship was built in 1957 and has been refurbished in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, accused of harassment and drunkenness, may be stripped of his top job.
Brett Kavanaugh, the future U.S. Supreme Court justice, may well miss his calling, says program director Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and misconduct during his college days.
Aaltola said the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up nominating someone else.
In the United States, it has happened from time to time that a presidential nominee for a Supreme Court justice has caused a great deal of controversy.
Aaltola says that in such cases the candidate for judge has usually withdrawn himself.
This is how the president has been able to keep his face.
The nomination would rain down on the Democrats .
The Supreme Court of the United States is trying to be above politics, but in Kavanaugh's case, at least, the selection of a new justice has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, Aalto said the decision would likely sway the Democratic Party in the upcoming midterm elections.
It would boost voter turnout among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, a conservative Supreme Court justice would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The opportunity for appointment does not come for every presidential term, for in the United States the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have abandoned their own retirement request at about the age of 70 or 80.
Even some Republicans are hesitant about the nomination.
A background check is normally done on candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court, Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has only given the FBI a week to come up with a new investigation, Aalto says it could bring something substantial to light.
It might.
"There is rarely smoke without fire", says Aaltola.
Aalto said what is certain is that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability for office will be hotly debated before the Senate makes a decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are expected to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination went to the vote and the Republicans lost.
Woman identified suspect Salisbury as a military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she has identified a Russian suspected of poisoning the Salisbury bombings as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
She told me that based on the photographs, it was a military intelligence officer working for the GRU, Anatoli Tshepi.
The Bellingcat online community and the Russian Insider Russia community said earlier that they had identified another suspected poisoning man as Chepigi.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities were cover identities.
A BBC team traveled to the Far East, near the border between Russia and China, to the village where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman in the village recognized young Tshepigan from the published photographs of Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from British police photographs of a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals made it.
In 2014, he was awarded the title of Hero of Russia.
Russia still denies any suspected GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning had told Russian TV earlier in September that they had been in Salisbury as tourists.
Old people thrown in bags in the reform of the soot
We have now got a living example of what the change limit for the reform of the common agricultural policy, as defined by the Opium Government, means in practice.
The Oulunkaare municipal association produces the soad services in my native Vaala, whose health service director was elected in 2016 by the former regional director of Attendo.
The city council is being warned by the city council about the change restrictor.
If the social security costs increase now, the state aid to the municipality will be cut in the future.
The local authorities were alarmed, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would end the hospital bed unit and the small memory unit.
Home care would be increased, which means that long-distance elderly people in remote villages in the Valais region would be taken from their roots to be treated at home next to a health centre.
Attendo was counting on the city to pay for his clients.
The left-wing party did not swallow the bad preparation, but organized a good public event, which was attended by many relatives, family carers and also representatives of other parties.
I presented the results of the SOT-provincial preparation, showing how the municipality of Vaala is currently the largest provider of home care for the elderly in the whole of the Nordic countries.
Also present was Carina Wäntinen, a local councillor.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again lifted the Oulu Circuit's organizers to their feet.
The war-makers don't write in any paper that Attendo has built a new care home in Valala, which is now waiting for its inhabitants to leave.
There are no other service providers.
The producers only talk about the service schedule, but do not say what level of care it will receive or what kind of staff structure Attendo will have to take care of the elderly until they are escorted to care.
Without a nurse?
The reason why the health centre is closing down is because there is no doctor on duty at night.
Attendo will also seek medical help from the Vaal Health Centre.
The example of the elections shows how central officials are manipulating the deputies with incomplete information and the deputies are being pushed against the wall with a change restriction.
The Centre Party is thus emptying the population of Vaala, because who will be left there unprotected to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move out.
Was there a slogan in the center that the whole country should be kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan inaugurated the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people showed their support when visiting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the beach at Reiniö since morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, there have been several demonstrations and security measures have been tightened.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to take to the streets in advance to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
The Grand Mosque was also crowded with Erdogan supporters.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque's surroundings for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdogan praised his visit to Germany as a success and said it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations that have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the EU's external action to include the fight against terrorism.
Criticism Surrounds the Visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and the Premier of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said she came to the anti-Erdogan demonstration from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't take to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed, subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany, a significant part of the population in North Rhine-Westphalia is of Turkish origin.
Three accused of murdering a journalist in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said Friday that three people are being charged with the February murder of Kuciak and his fiancee, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in a murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot dead with his fiancée in February at their home in Bratislava.
He had been investigating the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murders are linked to the Kuciak investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the cattle distribution on Sunday in sparsely populated areas.
The printing error also means that Sunday Karelian is being mailed without an address.
This may be seen in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where distribution to the common boxes is carried out from the outside.
The situation was the same with the newspaper on Saturday, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post office is putting extra newspaper clippings in the county.
The magazines of other subscribers in Finland are sent separately only on Mondays, when they are attached.
The delivery of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala, among others, in his upcoming live talk show.
Vesa is in the studio, talking about his upcoming space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000 and was paid by a bank loan.
If the original plans had been correct, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
But the departure date has been postponed every year.
Now, after a failed, fatal test flight in 2014, it seems that things are fair.
If all goes well, commercial flights will begin this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa's flight number is 300, so his journey will be about a year after his first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and in weightlessness, you'll be 5 minutes above 100 kilometers, a Finnish astronaut tells his homepage.
And at the same address, he's also backing his desire for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Flight and I saw Star Trek on TV.
I mean, we've seen Star Wars, and that's what got me thinking.
Why not? Why not?
Everybody has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host .
Manchester City continued their unbeaten run in the Premier League as they beat Brighton 2-0 at home on Saturday.
The sixth win of the reigning championship season will be secured by goalkeepers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to steer his fourth shot of the season from close range to an empty net when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute from the back of Brighton's goal.
Aguero raised his own score to five when he saw off the Brighton defence with Sterling in the 65th minute.
The Argentine managed to place the 2-0 score from the penalty spot with ease.
City, who started the season with six wins and one draw, lead the Valiliga with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, one game short, are only one point behind.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round match on Saturday night.
Youth associations elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations elected the new decision-makers for the next three-year period 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Upper Sava was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme was elected as Vice-Chairman.
The Board of Directors was elected with 40 full members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Associations announced on Sunday.
A youth meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The three-year action plan of the Joensuu Youth Council pledges three things: we will keep our doors open to everyone, we will organise equal leisure activities regardless of where they live and their background, and we will support volunteering and people in their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Council said in a press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Raikkonen and shocked Ferrari: "Lose a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British Mercedes dealer was asked whether he believed that releasing Kimi the Ripper from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the final month.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel in the points standings with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that the Ranger would not continue in the car next season, and at the same time the Ranger announced that he was moving to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't believe that the Rattlesnake would throw his gloves in the sink.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining games.
He's an exceptional professional. He's a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told me that the Rough One has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 on the PlayStation all day.
I was always Kim, which is kind of crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will resume on Sunday with the Russian Grand Prix.
From the starting point at 2 p.m. the Mercedes Valtteri Bottas will start the race.
The evening paper is following the race moment by moment.
The A-Young Championship match turned into a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The boys' soccer league ends on Saturday with the final round of the season.
Before the round, which started at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically enough to be the first team with a point against Vasa IFK.
To turn things around in the final round, Ilvekse, who is second in the championship fight, must win PK-35 and wish the Lakhtans a defeat.
However, the Lahti championship was in practice already confirmed before the opening call, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less player, the match would not have been possible.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At halftime, the Lakers led 7-0.
One reason for the lack of players is that the team has played with some of the same players in the A-Youth SM-Series, the P20 series, and the Men's Second C-Block.
Vasa IFK has played in the Second Division practically all season against relegation.
In the second round of the competition on Saturday, Vasa IFK will have to win the JBK away game and hope that Tampere United will lose their own away game against KuFu in Siilinjärvi Toivala.
The car ended up on the roof in Enola . The rescue team said it was a lucky break .
A car drove off the road and ended up on the roof of the Enos Event Garant on Sunday at about 9:00 a.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue service said.
It was a lucky break, the press release says.
The rescue team said the road was wet from the rain.
A police patrol was at the scene of the accident.
Supo is looking for new means of intelligence: equipment purchases and recruitment already done, no word on planned operations abroad
According to Supo's chief Antti Pelttar, the intelligence law has been prepared by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The offices of the Helsinki Police (supo) on Ratakata are already preparing for the entry into force of the Intelligence Laws.
Supo's chief of staff, Antti Pelttari, tells Western media that equipment has already been procured for future intelligence missions.
Serena Williams shocks with a video of her singing in her topless outfit, campaigning for breast cancer awareness.
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is on the move again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on Instagram of herself singing with her hands just in front of her breasts, reports AFP news agency.
The song is a cover of the 1991 Australian hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls.
Williams is supporting the Australian Breast Cancer Society with this video.
"I dedicated The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to do regular self-exams", Williams writes on Instagram.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it touches all women, regardless of skin color, everywhere in the world.
Early detection is everything and it saves a lot of lives.
The second writer of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is a tribute to Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first", Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
The comments on the video praise Williams for his courage.
Williams pulled out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is the U.S. Open three weeks ago.
Williams shot the referee and said, among other things, that men are tolerated for much more harsh behavior than women.
Chinese food on the mountain trail is not suitable for high-altitude campers
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant offers a magnificent view.
An exceptional restaurant has opened in Zhejiang province, China.
It's literally on the edge of a cliff.
You can watch the forest from there if you want.
The lush landscapes at the heights make the restaurant's guests gasp for breath in the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you have to walk among the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to travelers on September 19, 2018.
You know, YouTube comments are asking where the restroom is.
A walk to the restaurant requires a good grounding, the place tells.
The raven's smells are over tonight, and this is the end of it.
All good things come to an end.
Today, the domestic country drama The Raven's Roar has been a hit.
The third season has gone by like a hot stone: last week, 722 000 Finns watched the episode on television as a premiere.
The summits themselves are no longer of practical importance, for there will be no sequel to the Weaky Little Pony and the Junky Little Pony.
In the final episode, the relationship between Jaska and Mirku takes another leap forward, and I think Jaska's mother is the first to guess what's going to happen.
The relationship between Anss and Miisa is also warm, romantic in the light of recent events, but then again the figure of the Weak appears.
Even the police are suspicious of the snowman.
But none of you can predict the fate of the Shag.
Anita, on the other hand, is about to hear some incredible news.
The last will and testament of the distant one is revealed, which brings the woman to tears.
In a week, on Sunday nights, we'll be back with the new episodes of Soryeon.
The crow's nest is on TV1 today at 9:05.
So, tomorrow, with a little cold, is it worth going to work?
Here are the facts for and against.
It's flu season.
A lot of people don't care if they stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worthwhile for the worker to infect others, since the disease can be contagious even if the symptoms are minor.
Sometimes the flu symptoms come on suddenly, sometimes they're sneaky.
In the latter case, you may already be infecting others, even if your symptoms seem minor, says the journal Prevention.
So, is it worth staying home?
Prevention means that the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted from the day before the onset of symptoms to five days a week thereafter.
Children may be more likely to contract the disease.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or work.
You can return to work when your cough subsides and your fever is gone, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
Exercise is also to be avoided.
Too fast to get back to the gym will slow the recovery.
Remember to wash your hands, rub your handkerchiefs, and throw the toilet paper in the trash.
Still sick to go?
If you have to leave home sick, consider using a toilet.
The mask doesn't keep viruses at bay, but it keeps the wearer aware of the area of the head.
That's when you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Also, sneezing is limited to the mask.
How, then, could infections be avoided?
The best practice is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter, however, is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats the miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Ice hockey player and misses are often conflated.
This is also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The crown of Miss Finland 2018 was won by Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is an Inker Finn and her father is Russian.
Because of his father's Russian background, Voronkova was bullied at school.
Mom and Dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because I was Russian.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, Alina tells at the announcement of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland contest.
After high school, Alina decided to start fresh and move to Bay City to go to college.
Soon the Miss Universe found new friends and the week went on hopefully.
Then, at 15, you think you're an adult, but in retrospect, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is a member of the Pelicans.
After his SM-liiga career, the hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at the Under-18 World Cup.
In the early days of their relationship, the couple lived apart for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I were to make the winning trio and it would give me a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have a good relationship of trust and the good thing about long-distance relationships is that the starting point is always there, Alina grinned in May.

Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the earth.
And yet, there's nothing you want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to sustained growth are being sought, but even the theory of the reasonable economy is facing major problems.
The continuing growth of the economy has brought, over the course of a few generations, a standard of living that was once only a dream for ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere.
However, the long-term excess of the earth's carrying capacity and climate change are threatening to undermine this cornerstone of the market economy.
Two men were stabbed the night before Sunday in the Cannon Citrator at 4:00 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing, and another, born in 1968, was slightly injured.
The older man has already been released from the hospital.
Police have arrested one person for possible involvement in the stabbing.
Police are also looking for another suspect in connection with the events.
The incident is being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
Important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter coach regrets mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's equaliser against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt made it through the right flank and lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the away game, the Maarianhaminians extended the difference to two points at the Turun Ball Score at the place of the series winner.
"An important goal and a valuable point", summed up Maarianhamina's head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said that the team did not, however, ignite the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the Turks scored a goal that put us in the game stronger.
Inter head coach John Allen said the game was in control, but the goal was again painful.
One defensive error took us off the full point line, Allen was upset.
We were the best again!
Finland has the highest human dignity in the world
Finland has been ranked first in a comparison of 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the population.
Finland is the best country in the world, if you measure it by human capital.
Finland came first in a survey measuring citizens' health and education and learning.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published in The Lancet.
The summary shows that human capital has a significant impact on the future growth of the economy.
The most serious situation is in Africa.
The continental countries ranked seventh in the lowest ranking.
Niger is behind.
The STT was the first to report it.
The paper showed a weakness, the game location is still uncertain.
Jori Lehter's strong underpowering came to the fore as his NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their final practice game before the start of the season.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehter put Michael Raffl in the back of the net twice.
The last few days, the paper has been in the news because of the drug scandals.
MTV reported Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in drug gangs where suspects are known to use drugs and know about sales, for example.
The paper has denied any wrongdoing.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the matter.
Following the Flyers, Sam Carchidi of the Philadelphia Inquirer estimated after the game that Lehter is among a group of six forwards, five of whom will make the NHL team.
In the practice match, Carchid said Lehter was excellent.
In the second round, Lehter fought the puck to himself, underpowered, and pulled the defender to his side, and then threw Raffl into the open field, waiting for the goal.
The second time, the two of them collaborated and scored at the end of the game.
The Flyers open the NHL season on October 4th with a home game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defensive end Urho Vaakanainen is awaiting a decision from the team's coaching staff on whether he will be eligible for the NHL team.
I thought training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of it.
Now the coaches are gonna decide if I'm gonna play.
"I think I'm ready for the NHL", Vaakanainen said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
The River Boys' disc-schooler Vaakanainen played against Philadelphia in 19:31.
On Boston's field, the tough guy gave up four times and turned down 20.
The Falcons' defensive back, Wild Lake, led Detroit 1-0 as the team defeated Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary, Ilveksen was promoted, defending champion Juuso Välimäki got a point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers have retired Jesse Puljuve and goalkeeper Mikko Koski.
Alexander Barkov of Florida played for about 20 minutes and scored a goal in a home game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara scored a consolation goal in the middle of the final as Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
In the loss, Joonas Korpisalo turned down a 23/27 shot.
Already, some 180,000 people have answered the time questionnaire.
The public has actively responded to a poll on the decision on the future of Finland.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already received a fairly large number of replies.
The questionnaire opened on Otakantaa.fi will be answered in a few weeks' time.
Respondents are also asked to give their opinion on whether Finland should be in the same time period as the other Nordic countries, the Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
A recent photo shows a change in the world 's strongest man , who lost tens of pounds .
Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world in 2017, is going through a remarkable transformation.
Britishman Eddie Hall was a long and determined champion of the title of strongest man in the world.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 calories of food a day and, according to the Mirror, weighed 200 pounds at his largest.
The shirts were a size 5XL.
Hall admitted before he won the title that he had damaged his body.
The human body wasn't designed to be this big, Hall said.
The British was on a quest to win the World's Strongest Man contest, and the family man promised to quit his career if he won the title.
Hall didn't want his kids to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was never seen again at the 2018 World's Strongest Man competition in April.
Recently, Hall posted a picture on Instagram of himself posing in a significantly more slender form than his active career.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he's now doing aerobic exercise five times a week.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
Plus, Hall does four workouts a week at the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, an Icelander who also appeared on the TV series Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was first in 2000.
The restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed into cattle at Pyhäjärv - "Stick to the stone"
The inland waterway M/S Tampere was driving late Friday night in the Aqaba Pyhäjärv.
The rescue service received a distress call about a water transport accident Friday night after 12:30 p.m.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has run into the water and is firmly attached to its keel by a stone, described the day's fire chief, Matti Willman.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
The rescue team said no injuries were reported.
Passengers and nearly all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tamperet, said daytime chief Jari Nieminen to STT at 1 p.m.
Ambulance services were called to Viiala harbour to receive the evacuated passengers.
For some reason the ship, which was traveling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had drifted off course on the western side of the narrow Jumusen lake.
The police are investigating the cause of the incident.
Our friend, Fire Chief Matti Willman, told us earlier that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to the darkness and the rather strong wind.
The rescue team says the ship's fate is uncertain.
Looks like the ship's not leaking.
After the evacuation, the divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now a restaurant vessel with a maximum capacity of 180 passengers.
The ship also has a private rental meeting room.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser was refitted in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The freezing air is fading . Check the weather forecast for today .
This is the weather forecast for today and tomorrow.
On Sunday, there will be heavy cloud cover and rain showers throughout the eastern part of the country, while in western Finland the weather will turn more sunny.
The lunch chair is moderate.
Temperatures are between +7 and +12 degrees Celsius, and Northern Lapland is cooler.
On Monday, the southern and central parts of the country will be cloudy with a slight rainfall.
There are also many clouds in Lapland, but mostly dust.
The sun is the brightest in the Northern Hemisphere.
The temperature ranges from +10 degrees south to near zero in northern Lapland.
Ex-managers are demanding unpaid fees from Robert Helenius .
The fight tonight between boxer Robert Helenius and Erka Teper is shadowed by the money.
The news today from the Evening News is that the boxing manager Jaakko Helmin and the deputy referee Jussi Kokkila have filed a challenge claiming that Helenius, together with the late interest, has been charged with unpaid management fees totalling just over EUR 80 000.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We've tried to mediate, but we have no choice.
The Commission has been clear about the mandate and a lot of work has been done, says Kokkila to Ilta-Sanom.
Markus Sundman, the current manager of Helenius, sent a reply to the newspaper, which describes the events from the point of view of the boxer.
Helenius denies that it is obliged to pay the sum claimed.
According to the defendant, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and had promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was agreed verbally that Helenius would only be obliged to pay fees for a percentage of its matches.
Repeated assurances were given that Helenius would not have to pay anything, but would simply receive the income they arranged.
This is also normal and the only practice in professional sports management.
The wage has never been agreed and would have been unreasonable in Helenius's case, Sundman explains in his prepared message.
No written agreement was ever made.
According to the respondent, Helenius had initially wanted to agree on the income sharing in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman did not have the draft completed until the end of 2014.
He called the proposal bad for his own sake and cut off cooperation with Cook and Helmis.
Helenius never fought a fight when he was dealing with Cook and Helmi.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius was awarded an 'individual but substantial' bill for the manager's work.
This year, a lawsuit has been filed on the same grounds.
Helenius considers the subsequent activities of Helmi and Kokkila to be a disaster, the reply states.
Helenius will face the IBF heavyweight champion Erkan Teper today in Stuttgart.
A man of heart and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Pällis for decades.
Long-running radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The announcement of the death of the presenter was published in the Helsinki Gazette on Sunday.
The announcement says Pällis died on September 3rd.
Pälli reported on his serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened to learn of the fate of his acquaintance.
He left Facebook earlier as if saying goodbye, says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli a multi-talented expert who became a brilliant journalist.
He remembers Pällis as a popular person with quick wit and funny stories.
I got to know Erik as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouse boy.
That's when I met Erki.
He was Finnlevy's informant at the time and in various capacities, as Ile Vainio recalls.
When I was making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was the regular editor at every party, doing stories about artists.
He was always a professional, and I could see how passionate he was about entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a very kind man and a good journalist.
He became known to many as a respected Yellen radio host, but he also wrote brilliant magazine articles.
Erkki interviewed me a lot of times.
He was a good talker, Vainio says.
Over the decades, Pälli worked in addition to journalism at Fazer record company with Toivo Kärje.
He was a music producer for Vesa-Matti Loir records.
But Pell's greatest passion was radio work, with a style that was unique to him.
He worked in radio since the 1960's, and he became known to many listeners on the Yle airwaves.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of about EUR 450 000.
The Union describes its economic situation as having undergone a "complete turnaround", although the economy is indeed burdened by "significant debt on the balance sheet".
The Commission has also taken the necessary steps to ensure that the financial situation of the Union is not affected by the current crisis.
We reacted to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible by taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and financial management have been applied throughout our organisation, says Kulmala in a press release.
We have also been very successful in acquiring partners and, moreover, the World Cups were the most profitable in the last season.
But we must continue to manage costs carefully, and at the same time constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in Palun, on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where the injured survivors have been gathered for the purpose of assessing injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors for aftershocks.
One of the people who was moving around the hospital area was a 52-year-old firefighter named Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was on his way to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the military hospital in Palus, Dwi Haris was lying, with injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel when the quake struck, with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the Palu wedding.
I must have been squeezed under the collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they're safe, Haris told the AP, according to British media.
Small shops are being looted
At the evacuation center, 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who has a small baby, tried to calm her fevered baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma told me.
Many people in Puno have slept outdoors or in temporary fruit trees.
Even if the home were somehow standing, possible aftershocks could destroy it for good and bury its inhabitants underground.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the prisoners at Palun escaped after the walls of the prison collapsed.
The number of prisoners is known to be about 560, so there may be about 300 escapees.
Some inmates at Donggala Prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, prisoners became angry and set the prison on fire after guards forbade them to go looking for relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
The airport has been reopened for relief flights.
Among the first to land was an army C-130 transport aircraft, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palun Airport are only allowed on a limited basis.
Pilots are forced to land at the airport without help from air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain is sweeping over Finland at night
A long rain zone will spread across the country from the west on the night before Sunday, reports the National Weather Service.
Rainfall is mostly in the form of water, but in central and northern Lapland, it is expected to be rainy or snowing.
The painful cold of the previous night is not to be repeated, because the temperatures below the cloud cover remain higher.
A cloudier night keeps the lower temperatures in check quite effectively.
In the west, you can go to the cold for a moment, said fellow meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain zone will shift eastward as the morning begins.
In the south and west, it's cloudy or semi-cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures always move to the altitude of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in effect for the sea areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected in the coming days, but otherwise, typical autumn weather is expected.
"It's the autumn that's really starting to come", said Ilkka.
Miss Finland finals are not on TV
From IL-TV you can watch the glamour and glamour of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
The entertainment journalists of the evening newspaper are broadcasting live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from the Billnäsa pot.
The show starts at about 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from among the ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at the Billnäss pot in Raasepor.
Before the final, you'll be able to watch the atmosphere live on IL-TV.
The live broadcast will begin at approximately 6:30 p.m. and will last for approximately one hour.
This year, the finalists have been particularly numerous, with the previous Miss Finland winners.
They are represented on the jury by Miss Finland 1998 Jonna Ziprus.
The other judges are Jutta Gustafsberg, a well-being entrepreneur, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, the CEO of Jounin Kauppa, and Katja Lintunen, the news anchor of Seiska.
We were hoping she could get into college before she went to the Miss America pageant .
Russian father Dimitri and Hungarian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the recent Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly watched their daughter's first moments at the top of the crown.
They told the audience from Pertunaland and planned to drive back home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before she came, it was getting really exciting, and Svetlana was laughing.
Svetlana is an Inker and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina also speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than in her career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should start with Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio announcer.
It was only later that Alina became interested in beauty contests.
Her parents wanted her to go to university before she could compete in the Miss Finland pageant.
And so it was, and eventually Alina wanted to graduate from the school before the Miss Universe pageant.
We asked him last year why he wasn't participating, but he wanted to finish the cover.
The parents believe that Alina won the contest because she is a healthy example for young people and adults alike.
He's a lot of sports and he eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri is playing hockey for a job in Japan, and he didn't make it to Finland to cheer for his lover in the final.
Alina's parents believe that a teenage relationship lasts for a year.
That's the point!
Her parents hoped that she would soon be able to visit.
It's been such a long break from visiting because of the Miss Universe pageants.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Sari Piippo left her job in Brussels and became a stay-at-home mom in Finland - the idea of a comic strip came to her mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The creative jumping off point was my husband's statement, where he suggested that he was a person in a story I was developing, says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger, a housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says she was in Brussels as an EU translator on economic and legal matters until, after the birth of her fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I'm having a really good time being a stay-at-home mom.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought, what do I do when I'm older, when the smallest child is already growing up.
Then in 2014, we got a comic book.
Pipo says he never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he read The Duck, Tintin and Asterix as a child.
I hadn't drawn since I was a kid, but when these creationist manuscripts started to appear, things changed.
I started by putting a few dozen scripts in my desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a talented illustrator, but I didn't get her involved until the summer of 2016, when I donated Viivi with a sketch board.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen comic books, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Pipo, who says the sketchbook was a big motivator for him.
A disk is a simple and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, Piippo says about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
I'm always thinking about scripts, but I don't usually do them all at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to an hour.
I can do the screen one at a time, and I'm happy to play with the colors.
Starting to draw is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strong suit.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the current newspaper comic strip, including Scott Adams' Dilbert.
The creative personality is the L-themed carrot-faced mother with a salad dressing.
The other characters are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the world of organic food, you are what you eat.
The idea for the show comes from my own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a bullet even though he's got a little bit of a creative habit.
Pipo says she reads her books with her husband and children.
It's such a great feeling, isn't it, to look at a comic you've drawn and realize that this is what I've done today.
And enough challenges for a housewife!

Lotto's million-dollar jackpot was blown up. These were the right numbers.
No matches were found in the lottery in round 39/2018.
The biggest winners of the evening were seen at the Saturday Joker, which brought 20,000 euros to Vantaa and Vaasa.
Next week, the lottery will have 3.6 million euros.
Saturday Joker got two six-to-one results.
The second prize of €20,000 goes to the winner of the Vantaaa S-Market Tikkurila, who played the Gambasus card.
The other was caught by a rogue online gambler.
Indonesian earthquake: pilot sacrificed himself, did not leave the cracking tower until he had rescued hundreds of passengers
The hero of the Indonesian earthquake has been named as 21-year-old pilot Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung remained alone in the control tower until he was able to escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely from the earthquake-ravaged island.
The young man was on duty at the air traffic control tower at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in Palun city when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he could steer a Batik Air passenger plane from the runway.
He was able to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Authority told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
My flight control tower was spinning and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
He broke his leg and suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be flown by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation authority spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The tremor intensified after the flight took off, eventually measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
He lost at least 832 lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Authority has honored Agung's heroism on social media.
Reflecting on the end of the European trade war: "I'll have to check the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth forecasts.
At the first meeting of the European Council, Mr Rehn said that while the rising tensions did not have a direct impact on European trade flows, they were undermining confidence, which was reflected in the investment decisions of companies.
The same applies to exports by Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is a good breadbasket for the time being.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid.
I'm gonna have to look at the next tweet and evaluate afterwards.
We have a rather unpredictable partner heading to Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yale.
Europe also has its risks.
One of them is Italy, the euro area's third-largest economy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the Western world.
The market reacted strongly yesterday to the Italian government's Thursday evening presentation of a clear budget deficit.
Next year, the deficit will be more than 2.4 percent of GDP.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
The country's borrowing capacity is 5% problem loans and over 10% unregulated loans.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country appears to be once again exceeding its commitments to its European partners.
It is not worth painting new crises yet, Rehn said when asked whether Italy would lead Europe into a new economic crisis.
The second challenge for Europe is the UK's departure from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be okay.
A contentious divorce would have far more negative consequences.
Rehn started as the Bank of Finland's CEO in July.
The European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi will step down from his post in just over a year.
The discussion on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen's name has been mentioned in speeches.
It would probably be all right if Finnish names were included, Rehn said, adding that he would not comment further on the matter.
HS's super-popular Black Box shows continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box shows, organised by Helsinki Media, will continue again this week.
The remaining performances will be at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
23 October The Black Box makes its first visit to the Tampere Theatre.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre on sale.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers present on stage a long-prepared true story that has never been published in any of the HS's publications.
There's something else that's definitely not been heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night in Helsinki, a touching report from the other side of the world and a telling story about a very topical health issue", says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the HS's reporters and filmmakers and continue the discussion.
Helsinki News has been organising live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the start and often sell out.
Over 15,000 people have already visited the observatory.
The black box won the Bonnier prize for journalistic achievement of the year.
The awardees praised the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to get closer to their readers.
The 2019 Black Box season will be shown at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The show you will see then will have a different content than the one you see on these nights.
A "spineless experiment" found a missing mushroom
Finnish police's drone expertise is world-leading: "We are being asked for training"
According to the director of the Police College, the police can use the drone not only for the search for missing persons, but also for crime scene investigation and intelligence.
Oulu police managed to find a missing fungus controller in Raha on Tuesday using a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, director of the Police College, tweeted about the case, noting that "through unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are also the world's best".
Drone is a fairly new addition to the police force.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the champions of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
"There is a tremendous amount of interest in it elsewhere", says Himberg.
It would be hard to get visitors to see the Finnish police drone operation.
We're being asked for training.
It 's getting better .
Mr Himberg recalls that in Finland's winter conditions, finding the missing person as soon as possible is of the utmost importance.
As we've already seen, in the case of Raah, the missing person was found by drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained.
Drones are already widely used in police operations, and their use will become more common and widespread in the future.
I dare say this, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police may use drones, according to Himberg, for example in accident or crime scene investigations and certain intelligence missions.
For example, you have to go to a remote area where there is a possibility of violence.
The drone can then be used for prior interrogation.
The Wild Rugby has climbed to the top of the table
The club celebrated their second division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Riverrunners were still in the middle of the game with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a trick in the second half and beat the southern visitors 26-12.
The 2nd Division championship also saw Karelian Rugby achieve a historic rise to the 1st Division.
The club has previously played in the top flight, but at that time Finnish rugby was divided into two divisions, the SM-Serie and the multi-division 1.
The Society is going to take the lead, but they know they're going to have a lot of work to do next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players must be increased to 25.
Division 1 also knows about the growth in the number of games and longer trips, so the fundraising must be in line with that.
My hometown starts the season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien confirmed on Twitter that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked the super-promise of the 18th seed, Kotkanieme, in the first round at number three in the summer reserves.
The striker joined Montreal's practice squad at the end of the summer and has been a strong tackler in the September training matches.
My home team scored a goal in their first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps in his development since arriving at the camp.
The NHL's bullpen season starts next week, Thursday night, Finnish time.
Montreal is facing the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
This week in Finland, there has been a lot of talk about leadership.
In an interview with HS, Nokia's Chairman of the Board, Risto Siilasmaa, told us about his book The Paranoid Optimist, in which he outlines his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he is critical of the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ol rejected the allegations sharply, but previous Nokia statements have also spoken of the failure of managers to work as a team, fear and silence, which in part led to the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's rising risk-taking and agility were gone.
The Nordic Business Forum, a giant business event, was also held in Helsinki this week, bringing the cream of Finnish business to the Expo Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 other business leaders took the stage.
Enough of the talk about good leadership.
The legendary Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to lead a company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is, the people who make decisions are the ones who are most emotionally tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain known for its wide range of organic foods, said that a manager must be able to communicate to all his employees the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot be merely to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the book Introverts, said that the most successful leaders are those who are humble.
They are acting calmly, quietly and with determination.
They're often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, reminded that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the stage in the life cycle of a business.
In the early stages of a company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that's grown to maturity needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These teachings were heard at the Nordic Business Forum by 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish executives.
The danger was their information power.
A good leader requires a lot.
That's why leadership often goes wrong, even at the highest levels.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also there.
They talked to each other in the background as friends.
But they hardly wondered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easily measured by outsiders.
Sara Chafak arrived on the red carpet in a gorgeous way from Los Angeles , spending most of her time abroad .
Model Sara Chafak came to the Miss World finals in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also had a pizza loaf.
A little bit of jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me about his affairs.
Chafak says he's going to Los Angeles for auditions.
He's done some commercials.
Working in the United States, he describes as interesting, and also similar to Finland.
However, he says that the work must be done even harder, since a replacement model is always easily found.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
The choreographer Sonya Lindfors has won a €30,000 prize for live art in Kuopio.
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth €30,000 on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, who has won the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works in choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have not been exposed to before, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Lindfors from Finland, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The prize is awarded annually to an artist or group of artists of exceptional strength in the field of live art.
Danish police find a wanted Volvo in a major operation: 'We cannot tell you where'
The Danish police have launched a wide-ranging search for the body.
At the start of the operation, traffic was closed on the Jütinrauma and the Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själland was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached out to the chief of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The car we're looking for has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm from the Copenhagen police report tells Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo we're looking for has no direct connection to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet reported on Saturday's police press conference.
The head of the investigation, Jørgen Bergen Skov, was silent on the course of the operation.
He wouldn't tell me what the criminal code was for this case.
However, Skov told me that it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to the lives of people.
We've got three people on the lookout.
The police won't tell us if they've been caught.
According to the paper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
However, police say the public is no longer concerned because the threat is directed at certain people.
The name of Macedonia has been a source of controversy for decades . Now the people are voting on it in disputed elections .
In the Balkan country of Macedonia, a proposal for a new name is currently being voted on.
The agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece will be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far blocked Macedonia's bids for NATO and EU membership with its veto.
According to Greece, Macedonia is the name of its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
The vote began online at least at a school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped the agreement would be supported.
The referendum will be a change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contexts since it became independent in 1991.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has been campaigning for the treaty to be ratified.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boycott of the referendum.
The result will be a very exciting one, but it will also be a matter of whether the voter turnout will rise above the required 50 per cent.
The referendum is not binding, but a victory by a yes vote would give the mandate to amend the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in the House is required to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament has yet to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8pm Finnish time.
What a win!
Robert Helenius has knocked out Erkan Teper .
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late Saturday night in a heavyweight boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took a measurement of his 36-year-old German opponent at Waldenbuch in the Stuttgart quarter.
The main event of the evening was the Intercontinental title match of the IBF heavyweight championship.
The winner may be given a chance to compete on Saturday in more difficult tasks of considerable economic importance.
Helenius decided the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with a strong left-handed stroke.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
Nordic Nightmare hit his opponent in the third round, when the German's nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met for the first time in the ring.
They were supposed to fight back in December 2015.
Then Teper appealed to injury and withdrew from the match.
It was later revealed that the German had been twice strangled in a doping test.
Helenius has won 28 matches in his professional career, with two defeats.
Teper, who entered the match as the clear favourite, has won 19 professional matches and lost three times.
Hamilton 's team-mate to win , Vettel 's by 50 points .
The Formula One championship was once again close to being confirmed, with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton winning the Russian Grand Prix and extending his World Championship points lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who started from the starting position, was second.
Botta, who won his first race in Sochi last year, held the lead until the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to pass Hamilton.
Vettel was third, and Ferrari's Kimi the Robber was fourth.
Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who started from the last grid, was fifth.
Two men assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu , caught up a block away .
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltaku 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police say the men also seized the victim's cell phone.
Police tracked down the suspects, a 35-year-old man from July and a 39-year-old man from Ilocos, just a few blocks from the scene.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police say.
The victim suffered bruises that didn't require a doctor's visit.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, is stepping down as chairman of the board.
Musk has made arrangements with the U.S. authorities.
Meanwhile, Musk has been fined $20 million for tweeting that he secured funding to take Tesla out of the stock market.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Musk with securities fraud.
Musk will remain CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting time to reach a deal on NAFTA with the United States
Time is running out in the midst of the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the NAFTA free trade agreement.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators have been in close contact throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech to the UN General Assembly to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to put the treaty into effect before the Mexican presidential winner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's participation in the treaty is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that he plans to sign the treaty by the end of November, with or without Canada.
In view of these timetables, the text of the US-Canada agreement should be ready by Sunday to allow the US Congress sufficient time to evaluate it.
A neighbor thought the candles were a fire in Kaakkur . The fire department was alerted .
In a high-rise apartment in Kaakkur, Oulu, candles lit caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue units were alerted to the scene in anticipation of a possible fire in the apartment building.
It was discovered that the candles burning in the sauna of the apartment building had looked like a fire in the house opposite, and the emergency center was notified.
There was no fire on the target.
Police arrested 11 people after a fight between Honka and HJK. There was a riot at the airport and the subway station.
Police arrested 11 people on Saturday after the men's football league game in Espoo, West Newfoundland Police Department Crime Commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was to protect him from crime and disorder.
The detainees were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The prisoners were told earlier by the Evening Messages.
The game ended 0-0.
After the final warning, a large crowd of spectators rushed onto the field from the stands reserved for the HJK supporters.
The situation led to push-ups and fist-fights between the teams' supporters.
One of the things that was needed to end the situation was the cavalry.
In addition to the airport, the demolition took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn't there, but from what I saw in the pictures, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the riot that happened at the field.
Värten says that no criminal charges have been filed as a result of the events.
Pytkövi stunned butterfly swimming in his SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals of the swimming World Cup 3/7 competition in the Netherlands.
The competition is held in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS's Pöytäkivi broke her Finnish record in the 50m butterfly swimming event, where she was second in the preliminaries with a time of 22.82.
Previously, in September, Pöytäkivi swam in Helsinki with a time of 22.77 seconds.
Ari-Pekka Slikkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was 24.68 in the 24th time of the butterfly swim.
Swimming Club of the Year Laukkanen was sixth in the preliminary round of the 50m breaststroke with a time of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the preliminary round of the 200-meter medley, Laukkanen was 15th with a time of 2:14.25.
Students are playing a rare delicacy: a simplified version of the ancient tragedy of Oresteia , which affects their visual appearance .
The tragedies of antiquity are a rare delicacy on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre last saw the ancient tragedy, The Philoketes of Sophocles, in 1988.
Now the National Theatre School of Drama brought the only complete surviving trilogy of ancient plays, Aiskhylos' Oresteia, for the tour.
In the Laves Open! projects, which started in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre College work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of Orestei was held in Berlin in April.
Roya's adaptation of Oresteia summarizes the story of the end of the blood feud of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law to a worthy twenty minutes, in particular by summarizing the choral parts.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuur's fine Finnish translation (2003).
The dramatic lights and the exposing presentation of the theater's pages emphasize a simplified and bright stage thinking.
At its core is the dynamics between the performers who take turns leaving the choir, playing the titular roles, and the choir.
The performance uses both double and triple interpreters and nouns.
Actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example the murders of Agamemnon returning from the Trojan War and of his prisoner Cassandra are also shown on the stage, unlike the ancient tradition of theatrical performances.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize its loyalty to the ancient tradition of presentation.
Rather, it creates a modern, faithful interpretation of the text, constantly aware of its ritual roots, before the eyes of the viewer.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out the master's level acting students as a tight group, as one organism, a rhythmic ensemble.
In particular, in choral roles, actors who are keenly inclined to highly expressive, sculptural group formations, get their rights naked, only by decorating a white cover, on stage.
That was impressive.
The tour of Oresteia continues at the Kouvola and Oulu theatres.
Korean manufacturer builds its first hydrogen loader
The new trend is starting to take shape in Europe, in particular thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyundai and the Swiss company H2Energy.
The cooperation agreement published at the Hanover International Commercial Vehicle Show provides that Hyundai will supply a new model of a batch of 1,000 vehicles to the Swiss company and its partners.
By introducing the fuel cell truck, Hyundai is continuing its road-going lead as a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles, with the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also continuously looking for opportunities to expand the market area for these vehicles, for example by following the development of the refuelling network", said In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor, at the announcement of the agreement.
The fists were flushed several times in Kajaani
A man in his early 30s assaulted three men in and around a restaurant in downtown Kayani on Saturday morning.
The man first beat a man inside the restaurant, which resulted in his removal.
Outside, he would push the other man to the ground, and when the third man did not intervene, the assailant would beat him too.
The police caught the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another officer in the leg.
He also threatened to assault and kill the police.
They took him to the jail to calm down.
We're investigating three counts of assault and one count of aggravated assault on a public official.
In the center of Kajaani, a second assault occurred on Välikad on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Ca'an male in his 20s beat the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down, and the man who had hit him earlier kicked the victim again.
Outsiders pulled the assailants away from the victim and called the police.
But the perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
Police are asking witnesses to contact the Kajaani police on 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at investigativ.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
The long-line radio operator Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as a longtime journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio broadcaster Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he announced on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is a big deal.
The doctor said it, too, I live day by day, he commented on his condition to the Evening Post a month ago.
The safety of the Aunts and Uncles of the Trade must be guaranteed
I got my first newspaper story in 1984.
When a story surprises you on these years, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and even a little angry at times.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, an expert on the working environment from the Professional Association of the Service Industries (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us what's really going on.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
Only cases of clearly serious violence are reported to the police, and many real cases of violence go unreported.
"While companies are obliged to report their close-up situation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, these statistics remain for internal use and are not collected for any purpose", he said.
Mental injuries are not in the statistics.
The problem with violent situations has always been that they do not always result in physical injury.
Yet, psychological trauma can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
It is difficult to distinguish between a violent situation and a threatened one when a certain level of aggressive threatening must be considered violence - even if there is no intervention.
Too many people are afraid in the workplace even when the actual act is not happening.
Some residential areas are unstable.
The store has hired guards.
The media were also very vocal about the impact of the opening of the shops on the safety of the shopkeepers.
"At that time many employers arranged for guard services at least for the night hours and to prevent working alone", commented Kähärä.
When nothing happens, you draw the wrong conclusion.
This would seem to have had an effective effect, but it is creating a new negative trend.
When the security guard kept the disturbances under control, it was thought that the security guard was unnecessary.
In many places, efforts are now being made to find ways to eliminate the costly guard services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence and it is understandable that the assaulted seller does not want to make a request for an investigation into a criminal who usually lives in the vicinity of the store.
But, under the same section of the 2011 law, minor assault becomes a prosecution if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need a case-by-case basis.
The next time an aunt or uncle is assaulted at a store, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
If the courts put a few rapists in jail, and the sentence is at the top of the penal scale, things would be clean.
A society in which the food trade must be open almost 24 hours a day, even in small towns, must guarantee the safety of the workers in the trade.
Heidi Sohlberg wrote a receipt to Miss before the live broadcast began, "Sara, Iiro is married then".
Miss Coronation this year will not be seen on TV as usual, but will be broadcast on the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of the NHL and KHL studios Viasat and Viaplay.
Janni Hussi will be hosting the backstage and red carpet.
Before the live broadcast, the presenters briefed the guests and media on the progress of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjual a standing ovation.
Now all the women are screaming!
Now, look at our male host, Sohlberg, lighting up his colleague with the cheers of the audience.
The front-row competitions are followed by many previous years' Miss Finland.
Among them, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other, and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg looked at the Sarois and nodded.
What's more, Sohlberg was referring to the recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi first spoke of his divorce in the Evening News weekend paper.
Miss beauty told me that she doesn't want to reveal the reasons for the divorce in public because it's between her and Roope Salmi.
He said he wasn't in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I'm going to focus on my own things and, most importantly, I'm going to start living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marriage was revealed at a later stage, when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Hus and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The whole trio laughed at the mess.
Iiro was married, or what?
Janni Hussi has a receipt for the mess.
A Northern man tortured his bound penis by cutting, burning, and feeding it a hot sauce
A Northern Territory court has sentenced a 34-year-old man from Kokkola to three years in prison for a number of crimes against his ex-wife.
The tools used for the crime included a belt, a cable, and a tie.
The court ruled that the items were lost to the state.
The Rank case involved a suspect in aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the trial court.
The accused was charged with four counts of assault, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two counts of injury.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May last year.
As a result of his last acts, the man was caught and arrested a few days later.
Last Thursday, the Northern Territory District Court issued its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape .
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated assault and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed without evidence.
The case was tried in court behind closed doors.
However, the judge in the trial made the verdict public.
The judge in the trial found that the defendant had used violence, threats and coercion against his wife in situations where she was bound.
The defendant slashed the victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, ate a hot sauce, and poured water and coffee over him.
In its judgment, the court ordered the state to forfeit the instruments of the crime: a belt and cable, tie-dye, a bathrobe belt, a knife, and a washing machine.
Four witnesses
The district court found that the parties continued to live together in the interim.
The conviction records show that most of the most egregious crimes occurred at the end of the criminal period.
The trial heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old victim is to be paid compensation for pain, injury, suffering and temporary harm totalling €5,800.
He hardly has that kind of money, because the convict has debts from his parents in the inheritance.
This isn't his first time in prison.
The evening paper won't reveal the name of the convict to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent verdict of the plaintiff is not legally binding as of this writing.
Europe leading by four points to the Ryder Cup Final
European golfers sealed their lead in the traditional hole-in-one against the United States on Saturday.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup in Paris by 10-6 with 12 matches to go on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four quadruple scores that began on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four games, the winners were tied 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
No European couple had ever achieved this.
Sunday, the two of them will be pursuing more history.
No European player has ever scored five points in a single Ryder Cup, and no American has more than three: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
The HJC condemns the harsh disruption of the Honka match by its supporters: "Violence is not part of football"
The football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning the disruptive behaviour of their supporters at the FC Honka match in Tapiola on Saturday.
"We apologize on behalf of our fans for the events that followed the Honka-HJC match", the statement said.
After the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some appeared to be trying to provoke a quarrel with the Hong supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers were unable to calm the situation and police were needed on the scene, as well as mounted police.
The HJK said in a statement that the players and staff of the team are shocked by what happened.
The events after the fight are not in keeping with the traditional values of the 111 year old we follow.
"We strongly reject any activity that jeopardizes the security of match events", the statement said.
The HJC promises to assist authorities and event organisers in identifying threats to safety and in removing minor incidents.
Supporters' culture is part of football and it's important to the HJK.
We support in every way the positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football halls.
"Violence is not part of it", the release says.
A Filipino inventor flies a drone car to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He's now part of a growing worldwide movement that swears to have invented a flying car, or at least its own version.
He has competitors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of his equipment.
Reports from around the world indicate that the man has spent a large portion of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight, dropping his device at over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will elicit positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL forecasts: Work struggles starting tomorrow will be seen in childcare and social and health services
The new rules will be implemented in the public and welfare sectors, with the ban on overtime and shiftwork starting tomorrow, particularly in social and health services and childcare, says JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be wide-ranging and will certainly be seen in the lack of staff on site.
Everyone has to figure out how to get their kid back.
The employer's job now is to make sure that the services are working and that no one's life is at risk, Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the reduction in the number of employees was also evident at the beginning of the year, when the members of JHL were banned from working overtime and shifting due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility not to hire staff, but to keep workers on overtime or shift shift.
This isn't a work-fighting operation yet.
It is a matter of course that, in the field of occupational safety and health, all workers are required to work regular hours and only those hours are observed.
JHL opposes the Government's intention to ease the redundancy protection for small businesses.
The Director of Employment for Local Employers, Markku Jalonen, does not make a preliminary assessment of the effects of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not think they are very revolutionary, although services may be weakened.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be made.
The area is so vast, social and health activities and the technical sector, that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary widely by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week, experiences were already gained from similar three-day events, including those of the local and primary care association Super and the social and health professional association Théhy.
The effects were quite minor.
The JHL overtime and shiftwork ban applies to, inter alia, municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day-care workers are excluded.
The workfight is affecting almost 100 000 JHL members at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The Union is also prepared for further action if the preparation of the redundancy act continues.
The government should admit right now that this is a running into the wall and hard.
Falosen believes that both the labour movement and the government must take action.
What's special about this is that the hard ones are already on the beep, even though the show hasn't been given yet, Jalonen updates.
The Great Barrier Reef is being built by the power of children and adults . In the gyms of the show , the gestures of the raccoon and the seahorse are being studied .
The Great Coral Reef was first performed in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday was presented for the second time in Finland, this time at the Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, The Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish with the audience.
This time, however, a more clear-cut presentation is also being constructed, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is enough fairy-tale magic in the theater for children to play in.
The child's perspective is already taken into account in the preparation of the work.
The Great Barrier Reef, however, is not a children's show but a show that adults and children do together.
It gives adults information and observations about how children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to engage in exercise and play together also blurs the distance between adults and children.
The Great Barrier Reef is somewhat like a ballet, a gym, and a nature-themed awareness, but it ultimately fits in with the other, nonhuman conditions surrounding the visits.
The Great Barrier Reef begins with a study of the movement of corals, the life forms and fish that live on the reef.
Six different training centers teach the gestures of the raccoon and the seahorse, among other things.
Finally, a show of less than an hour, with music, lights, glittering paint, and costumes, will help you to get a glimpse of the life of the coral reef.
The Great Barrier Reef is both a place where people dive, where they observe the life of the reef, and where the corals are observed.
And we're also creatures that study corals.
The gazes and observations directed at the crowd make the performance dense and full of life.
It's like having the landscape of an organism, the organism looking at the landscape and the other organism looking at the life or the landscape - and all of these things at the same time.
It doesn't seem difficult to the child.
The other group is trying to push the boundary between thinking and acting, which is a challenge when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it all the more remarkable.
After the workshop, a peaceful protest will be held at Sittor for endangered corals.
Though it may be difficult to grasp the importance of exercising one's own compassion in the face of catastrophic visions, one should not be hardened by the calamities beyond human comprehension.
In other places, he has built his work on respecting the diversity of life, including through political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and future generations of them, for whose wonder and play it creates space.
Kids grow up too fast. I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
Today's children and youths are more irresponsible than ever.
Young people start smoking and drinking younger and younger all the time.
I think children should be children all their life, not mess up their lives with drugs and sex, because everyone else says they do.
I was shocked when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister's "boyfriend" for the weekend.
When she came to pick up her drunken sister, she told me about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned all our childhood that you can't touch drugs and sex is for grown-ups.
I hope that today's children can have a decent childhood, and that they will not have to grow up too early because of peer pressure.
I keep seeing on Instagram younger girls, more and more younger girls, with their makeup on their faces, and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing photos at night.
It's getting harder to tell how old the girls are.
It's easy for a 13-year-old to look like an 18-year-old and older.
My childhood was spent playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
I was able to be a child for many, many years, without having to worry about what others thought of me.
General: Authorities have informed the State leadership that the Airiston Helmi case is not related to national security.
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by the YLE, the security police and the defence forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week to inform them.
The Finnish government has been told that the investigation of Airiston Helme is not currently related to national security, but to organized crime, Yle reports.
The information from the anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (co-chairman of the Upper Defence Committee).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Security Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily a financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was more to it, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to the top officials, so far, no evidence of a connection to national security has been found in the seized material, but the investigation is still in progress.
We cannot yet know what may be revealed, observes one of the subjects interviewed by Yale.
The week-long, extensive house searches in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is purely about economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
The Evening Post put together a story earlier this week reviewing the arguments for and against.
Video: The dream paint saved Liverpool from losing the series
Liverpool's 100% start to the Premier League was over, but they were still more satisfied with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and went 1-0 away.
And then Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the whole Valiliga that City were serious now.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Valiliga with six straight wins.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be in control of his own end of the pitch.
Chelsea, meanwhile, had a fine away win in the League Cup at Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to end the game with a spectacular individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first bowled in a small space in a three-way game with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard got a little bit on the edge of the penalty area, but from there he bombed a perfect left foot into the back-bottom corner of the bet.
Pool point guard Alisson was a little slow on the offense and only got his finger on the ball.
Klopp must have felt slightly unfair in the losing position, because almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger wiped Mo Salah's control of the goal line.
In the second episode, Chelsea's Kepa got into the real thing.
The goalkeeper quickly reacted to Sadio Mane's move and pushed the ball from the base of the stick into the corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson scored a zero on a throw to pass Hazard.
The best place for the visitors came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his center.
However, the brass star's buzz turned to his national team teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
And it didn't last long, either, until the 89th minute, when Daniel Sturridge, the substitute, was able to get a free kick from 25 yards.
Sturridge was playing in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed the top corner of the uncontested bet in his honor.
Liverpool's 100% league start ended in a 1-1 draw, but they're still in the top flight - alongside Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly in the championship standings, two points behind the top.
The clock-shifting debate is deep in the gutters.
I remember a newspaper asking different Finnish influencers about the division of the Finnish people some ten years ago.
The only answer Juice Weskini remembered was "nose-tips".
Some people have a nose in their last name, some people don't.
You know, you can have a line anywhere, and here was one of the bidders.
Finland has succeeded in getting the EU to abandon the annual clock transfer.
Many people agree that the shifting of clocks twice a year has been the work of fools and has caused many problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest step in the solution, at least in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The difficulty now is to decide which time will eventually be reached - the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also gives the public a chance to express their views on the website otakantaa.fi.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
The discussion is heated at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has a say.
The winter time advocates base their position on the effect of morning light on people's well-being, and the summer time advocates the effect of evening light on people's desire for outdoor activities and thus on their well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good reasons.
Research shows that morning light sets the pace for a person's day and gives him a sense of alertness.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, light will increase the movement of people outside and provide better opportunities for, for example, autumn gardening.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated per hour.
I'd rather have both, but given our location in the northern hemisphere, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many people anyway.
A typical discussion of a subject is one in which one's own views are promoted and the views of others are strongly opposed.
The argument of the other party is not often listened to, because what matters is how the matter feels.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat futile to try to turn another's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is extremely easy to discuss, because it does not require much effort and the argument is simply mutual knowledge.
Similar issues are usually argued with the same intensity and fruitlessness as before.
I know it's a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I think we're gonna get used to it.
And it always provides the perfect scapegoat if life seems a little tricky.
If he fought for the bastard's guest victory
Jossa's first away game at the Salibandy Divary produced a three-point lead against Nurmo Jymy.
Josba left Wall River for home with a cheerful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still leading with a goal at the start of the third, but Josba was picking up the compositions and recycling the men in chains.
In 50.47 the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning score.
In the ice-skating matches of both teams, the decisive minutes were played in a draw.
The most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepowered anyway, with Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hitting.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also scored in the second set.
Ifbal has six points after three rounds.
Next up is O2 in the guesthouse in two weeks.
Sunday at my uncle's church for the 200th anniversary.
The 200th anniversary of the church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a somewhat somber atmosphere.
The burning of the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross a week ago was a shock.
Uncle's church was also guarded for two nights after the fire.
And despite the pain, today is still a day of celebration.
Although no one would like it, Enon Church is now the oldest church in Joensuu Parish Association.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Enos, despite all the municipal and other unions in the world.
The family ceremony starts at Enos church tonight at 10:00.
Then we'll move to the parish house, next to the cattle feeding table.
There's a lot of stuff on the show all day, inside and out.
For example, the church building can be visited under the guidance of Ari Räsäs, a retired parish priest who served for 37 years.
The birth of the Church also marks the end of an era.
The disused 1982 congregation hall is opening its doors for the last time today.
Now we are in the evacuation facilities of the former municipal building, says Kapuyan Markku Koistinen.
The parish hall was destroyed by air problems, but the church has stood in its rightful place for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chairman - fraud charges settled for $40m
Electric car maker Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have settled their legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he founded.
But Musk will remain the CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will be forced to step down as chairman of Tesla's board for three years.
The company will have to hire an outside board chairman.
Musk will also be subject to tighter controls.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent directors and to monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and disruption to Tesla shareholders", says SEC Director Steven Peikin.
The case began in August when Musk tweeted that he might pull the company off the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's finances are secure.
The tweet instantly boosted Tesla's stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not discussed the arrangement with other company executives or potential backers.
In effect, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running the stock exchanges.
The SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock plummeted.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
The death toll from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Indonesia has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency, AFP news agency.
The death toll is expected to rise as the damage is still being investigated.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may be in the thousands.
Friday's earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck the town of Palun on Sulawesi Island.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the quake, but it was quickly canceled.
Officials say almost all of the known deaths are Palus, at least for now.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area, near the epicenter, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
Requests for Help From Ruins
The Indonesian military has been alerted to rescue workers to search for victims.
President Joko Widodo, who arrived in the disaster area today, urged the military to continue the rescue effort without tiring day and night.
One of the centres of rescue efforts is a hotel in Palus, where it is believed that some 50 to 60 people remain in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency that is leading the rescue, said that one person was brought out alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, a popular destination for business travelers.
We also heard people crying out for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy equipment would be needed quickly in the area of the earthquake and tsunami.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palus and the surrounding area.
Family members of my friends still missing, a writer appealed in a Facebook group.
British politicians' phone numbers leaked to mobsters
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to flaws in the app's encryption.
The intruders gained access to the telephone numbers of ministers, among other things.
It was an app used at the Conservative Party's party conference in Britain.
For example, the Brexit-driven Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were targeted for harassment.
Several members of Congress received harassment calls.
The lack of encryption in the app allowed the public to access the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile app for the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public gained access to the profiles by using the politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
The user logged in to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to convert a pornographic image and a title to an offensive Boris Johnson profile picture for a moment.
Michael Goven's profile picture was replaced by a photo of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the user can view the contact information of the profile person and, say, send messages on their behalf.
The meeting app made the phone numbers of every reporter, politician and attendee public, Foster criticized.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party apologised for the leak.
He said the technical issues were resolved and the app is now working safely.
The UK's Information Commissioner's Office is supporting the leak.
The app was developed by an Australian company called Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party is critical of the Conservative Party's ability to be trusted on security matters.
Every week, the audience of The Wall Finland is a huge crowd of Polish people clapping
The attentive viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience to The Wall Finland.
The US format of The Wall, which has spread rapidly around the world, landed on the Finnish version of Nelos last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen was filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
The Polish studio was exceptional in its ability to shoot, as the large, 40 foot tall screens required space.
During the launch, the show's studio audience, which was assumed to be Polish, was highlighted on social media.
There was a discussion on Twitter about whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
The head of the four domestic programs, Sleeping Rings, will explain the situation to the Evening Post.
He says that the studio audience includes close friends of the players, other Finns, foreigners living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
The audience for the Finnish production is made up of international applause, just like the audiences for the other episodes of The Wall, which are filmed in the same production facilities in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who attend the screenings of various programmes, with the support of Ringmunen.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult, even if we do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters on the job in the studio to help translate for foreigners.
There are two interpreters, who simultaneously interpret for the studio director what is going on.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of pitch is going to be thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going to be, Ring says.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselhoff was treated in a domestic production recently.
David Hasselhoff was in the cast of Talent Finland a few years ago.
He was constantly hearing synchronized interpretation and he knew everything that was said in Finnish in the recordings, the sum of the Rings.
Typhoon in southern Japan is heading for the main island, authorities warn of landslides and flooding
Officials are also warning of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in the Typhoon Tram, but authorities say major injuries have been averted and no fatalities are known at this time.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars over.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters and more than 300,000 homes have lost power.
Over a thousand flights have been canceled, and bullet trains are at various stops due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly in the storm's path, but it is also expected to experience strong winds and heavy rain.
All trains in Tokyo are canceled today.
Meteorologists say the tram will haunt Japan until Monday.
The sky of the aces grew darker
The first few months of the A's have been a little rough.
The sky was almost dark for a moment when the team lost on Saturday at home to Vaasa Sport with a score of 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Boroughs now have five straight losses, and the points from six rounds are tied at two.
No ace defender or player in the bottom two of the chain has scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing.
The sports crowd was already in the hall with about half the game remaining.
We've only played six games, and there's no reason to give up.
Of course, you should be worried, because that's how badly we played.
Especially the second round performance was shamefully bad, said Jarno Kärki, who made the Aces 1+2.
The sport naturally enjoyed victory.
The team had a game on Friday night, so I would've thought it would show in the making.
Maybe it was, but the Ace couldn't make it work.
The number of people attending the Memorial Day continued to grow
The mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Goodvarinen, is watching the big hall and wondering how many people are there.
Somehow it was thought that maybe this year not so many people would come, the Good One thinks in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the SM competition for Tractor Fishing was held at the same time as Bread Day, so it might be expected that the audience could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
But it was the opposite: the hallways were already clogged before ten, the vendors announced that they were out of products, the newsstands were sold almost 500 times more than before, and the number of cars was also on the rise.
The estimated attendance has been about 6,000, Goodwill will tell later this afternoon.
The five-hour program for families with children was particularly large, and this may have attracted a record number of children.
In addition, the good man estimates that the event will go further.
Also, the sellers flock to Lipper every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred bakers had arrived, presenting handicrafts, bakery and harvest products.
The mother of the day, Pirkko Goodvarinen, was amazed by the crowd watching the hall.
The day of the bread began with the blessing of the harvest.
In the children's series, "The Beautiful Bread of Teija Kiviniemi" won the audience vote.
The children's bread contest received 11 different types of bread.
The winner of the rose-bread contest, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in the hamster pie maker.
7 times the most beautiful light . This is how you know a good lamp .
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the decor, and read the book without your eyes getting tired.
You bet on good lighting.
We've put together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tip was given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do your eyes a favor.
The more years you're gone, the more important lighting becomes.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many face as they age, with decreasing vision and increasing glare.
As parents grow, so does the need for light.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
So it is worth betting on the therapeutic effects of light and the properties of a lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but not the sparkle, the Yogi's hint.
♪ Make your surroundings beautiful ♪
The only way to bring out a beautiful interior is to have the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
Popular is the Japanese style, which combines the animation, Scandinavianism, and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 1970s, with its strong colors, different shades of metal or ice cream colors, has also risen to the point of boom.
I'm as fascinated by authenticity as I am by any other decoration in the home.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bamboo.
Let Your Personality Become Clear
On the other hand, home design is now more important than ever, and interior design has become a way of expressing oneself.
Instead of mass production, you want a custom-made, bold lighting in your home with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, says the Joker.
You may not get the latest fashionable light bulb, but you get a timeless classic that you have been saving for years.
"Certain timeless, ornate and elegant classics stick with us from year to year", says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian forward after three games .
KooKoon and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell are going their separate ways.
The Canadian striker played in three league games in the orange shirt without scoring points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell joined KooKoo in August on a one-year contract, which included a trial period through the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played for Kunlund Red Star in the KHL and KHL Farm in the VHL at KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no word yet on O'Donnell's new company.
The player wants to set an example in recycling. The goods go out into the world in recycling bins.
The games specialist company Gelimies now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the stone-shops are no longer packed in plastic bags but in paper bags made of recycled materials.
Products ordered from the online shop are packaged in packaging such as that received from importers.
All the packages that come in here are recycled.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in a condition to be used, says Ville Puurula of Oulu's Player Man.
As a softening material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Avoid bubble flows as far as possible.
In the near future, we intend to move to recycling material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is not an extra hassle, according to Puurula.
It's not a big deal to start recycling.
It also saves money when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is an inherent part of the activities of the Players' Association, as the core product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment, in addition to new products.
The same shirt works in every outfit.
Classic clothes work season after season in a suit rather than a suit.
Their versatility forms the basis of a good wardrobe, since it is easy to assemble a variety of garments around quality classics at a reasonable cost.
In the fall, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category includes the black polo.
A black needle made of natural materials cannot be mis-purchased by a semi-precious stone.
The garment can be combined with either straight trousers, a tights or a skirt, and can be worn around the body in both a restrained outfit and a flamboyant style.
The pool sole is suitable for both the young modern wearer and the sophisticated classic style table.
This is how you create style.
The fall trend is born of gold-brown and loose-fitting waterproof trousers, black polo neon and gray anklets.
The classic pool sole, together with the other classics, the blue-green Scotch-white and the red-wine loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring the black to the pool hole by combining it with the trendy items of the day: a skirt, high boots, and thick sock shorts.
Young and classy!
Russian intelligence has a long tradition of sabotage.
There is no reason to believe that the SVR or the GRU have abandoned this practice.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian words diversion-distraction and gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
Detailed plans for important sites of sabotage were prepared by agents of the Soviet KGB in the West, says Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004), a KGB archivist who defected to the West.
His findings were published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, docks, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB procured uniforms and outfits for undercover operations for the Bundeswehr, railways, guards and road workers for the DRG groups.
This is the trick used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in the local riot police uniforms of Ukraine, set up checkpoints for the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from its homeland.
During the Cold War, agents hid supplies for sabotage groups in the countryside, containing mines, explosives, detonators and communications equipment.
Back in 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, and the enzyme exploded when the authorities sprayed it with water cannon.
Police caught four drunk drivers in the county last night.
Police arrested four drunk drivers in various parts of North Karaj between Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Conti Gulf breathed in 1.57 per milliliters.
He drove at half past four in the morning at the start of the Kajaani ride with two passengers.
At the Kneew Lake Shore Guarantee, a car crashed into a ditch at 4 a.m. and a 19-year-old local man, who was alone in the car, blew 1.54 promille according to police.
He didn't suffer any serious injuries on the way out.
In the center of Outokumpu, a 20-year-old out-of-towner driving a car blew 1.33 per mille on the alchemist.
Police suspect the male drivers of gross drunk driving and, in addition to the driver of the Knees Lake, of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning, at the intersection of Öllöläntei and Hoikantei in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man driving a local van blew 0.52 millimeters of air.
He's on suspicion of driving while intoxicated.
Police are requesting a report of a stabbing at Turku railway station after midnight.
Police say the man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with fatal consequences.
The act was recorded on a security camera.
The dark-haired suspects, wearing dark trousers and brown or beige jackets, immediately after the stabbing, drove away in a dark farm car towards the Ratapihan Street bus station.
One of the suspects left on a bicycle on Humaliston Street, heading downtown.
A pedestrian died after being hit by a bus in Pori.
A pedestrian in the village died in the early hours of Saturday morning after being hit by a bus.
The accident happened after 4:00 a.m. on the Rauman Road near Niittuma.
The driver of the van is not suspected of any crime.
Police are investigating the events leading up to the accident.
HPK is holding Riska for the rest of the season. The paper's trial period is over.
The head of the Hämeenlinna HPK, Mika Toivola, says that Filip Riska (center) has been important to the team in starts, under-play and in the defensive role of the fourth-place team.
Filip Riska, who started in the trial, will continue in the Hämeenlinnan HPK for the rest of the season.
Experienced Riska, 33, success in the roles offered to him convinced the management.
Filip has been important to us in the starting lineup, the underpowering and the defensive role in the fourth.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to keep such an experienced player, commented the HPK sporting director Mika Toivola in a club press release.
Hopefully, Risk's value will increase as he plays the deciding games of the Hockey League.
Riska, a centre-forward from St. Petersburg, has previously played league cricket for JYP, Luko and Sport.
Offensive lineman Oskari Lehtinen was instead left without a contract after the trial.
True story on TV tonight: a climber was left for dead twice.
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experiences.
Tonight's movie is based on them.
Everest is now premiering on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm caught the climbers on Mount Everest by surprise.
Baltasar Kormákuri's 2015 film tells the story of a struggle for survival that has been treated with grain.
This tragedy has been made into films and documentaries before.
We're going to go over the actual events in this case.
Twenty-two years ago, the world's highest mountain claimed the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders, Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was the one who was acting as Weathers' guide.
A surgery on his eye before he left for Nepal may have saved his life.
As a result of that and the atmospheric pressure, he lost his sight, so the summit was not to be conquered.
Rob Hall went on and never came back.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he got lost and never found his way back to camp.
When they came to look for the man, they found him in such a bad condition that there was no hope of survival.
Weathers was left for dead.
But then, miraculously, he got back on his feet and found the others.
The worst cold Weathers was thought to be still dying and once again left to his own fate.
What is clear is that, contrary to expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even the other skiers began to believe in the possibility as much as he was helped.
In the film, Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is the 200th anniversary of the church of Enos .
The 200th anniversary of Uncle's church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and a family celebration was held on Sundays to commemorate the celebration.
The celebration began at 10 a.m. at Enon's church, with a family mass followed by a cattle-based dinner at Enon's parish house.
The church was packed.
517 people attended the family fair.
The churchmaster, Armi Irutavuori, was happy that so many people had come to the church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to the work, says Iron Mountain (pictured).
The fire of the Church of the Peril of Exaltation has touched many, and it was not ignored at the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Enon congregation.
The church of Enno is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations in Joensuu after the church of the Peril of the Passion was destroyed in a fire.
The wooden church of the Excitation was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a funeral service was held in the hotbed of excitement, with silence and remembrance of the church destroyed by the fire.
Photos and Videos: A doctor's spectacle in Greece - The sea disappeared and a street became a river
A powerful autumn hurricane-type storm made landfall in Greece on Saturday afternoon.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Agency has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The pictures taken from the area show a lot of flooding all over Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the town of Kiaton in the Corinth region due to flooding.
The second video shows the car being swept away by the floodwaters.
In the southern Peloponnese, strong winds caused heavy seas.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens is instructing people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The Embassy urges you to follow the weather forecasts and the instructions of the local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or median, brings heavy rains and even a flood hazard.
According to CNN, a 2011 study found that medican appears only once or twice a year worldwide, typically in the autumn and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm, now blowing, left its mark on Tunisia and Libya before continuing northward and toward Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also been raised about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to adequate protection.
The storm will also affect areas of Athens that have been devastated by fires in the summer.
In Greece, the medical profession was also in a state of disarray last November.
The sea is off-limits, but flights are still on schedule. Thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands, threatened by a severe autumn storm.
Sea trips are canceled, and even when walking, be careful that branches or other loose goods do not fly overhead in the storm.
Guides have distributed such instructions to a fairly large number of 3,500 Finns on their weekend holiday in Greece through Sunflights.
The instructions will be needed, as even the most terrifying of all the Zorbas storms is predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds can rise in a blast of up to 150 feet [45 m] per second.
The weather is turbulent, and heavy rains are adding to the turbulence.
All those travelling from Greece to Finland via Sunflights and Tuin, who have provided their phone numbers, have been warned of the strong winds by text message, according to the tour operators.
♪ Still the sun and the heat ♪
According to Inka Ikos, a communications expert on sunbathing, by early Saturday evening, the worst had been avoided in the resorts.
For example, flights have landed and taken off on a normal schedule.
Of course, we're monitoring the situation at all times.
Security first.
The media correspondent of the aid agency, Antonia Schroderus, reports that their flights have also been on schedule.
We're in constant contact with our personnel on the target.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the early hours of Saturday.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of just over 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on Kos is expected to hit Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had also risen in Rhodes, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C], reports the Sunshine Icon.
Zorbachev is projected to be the next Turkish leader, albeit with a slight easing.
We have already contacted Turkey and our staff there, and checked, for example, the number of Finns who flew to Antalya on the Tu, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss , identical nightwear at the Miss World finals , this is how they reacted to the situation .
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland finals on Saturday in a wide-brimmed evening dress.
Hussi says she got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me the perfect dress for tonight.
The exact same silver evening dress was chosen by the host Shirly Havin.
The twin himself noticed the similarity in their outfits and laughed.
Karvinen told Evening News that he was in a hurry with the preparations, and he had to get on a plane.
Hussi will be the backstage and red carpet host for the Miss Final, and he'll be talking to the front-line stars who arrive.
Hussy's been on the move for a while. He moved from Camp to Big Island on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on holiday alone in Greece.
It was great. I was only in a hotel for a week and I didn't go anywhere.
When the stress came, I caught a cold, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirley Karvis ' behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention , attracted the curious gaze of the retired .
The presenter and 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen told the Miss Finland final on the red carpet that she had enough to do with radio broadcasts and Love Island Finland filming.
The speed has even been enough to get Karvinen into the final straight from Finnair.
I put makeup and hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
I'm at the dress-up house, hairy laughing.
The hairy one says she's been showing off her makeup in front of the retired.
His preparation also caught the attention of his fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror, and I could see people staring at me.
I mean, I was having fun with my makeup, at least to the people around me.
The hairy one flies to Spain once a week.
He spends about a few days at a time in Marbella.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his time as the host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as being, up to now, also a stopgap.
And the hairy one says he went to the show on Friday to cheer for the singles.
It's kind of really raw.
They're real human emotions, and Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles on the show.
How do I get my top-of-the-line boots on?
Three Perfect Examples
Classic clothes are garments that work from season to season in a different suit than in a suit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes there's room for the most modern of individuals.
The top-of-the-line boots that became the fall and winter hit a few years ago have not gone away.
True to its name, knee-high boots are a classic from year to year and from season to season.
The boots look good, but the bold ones are worth trying.
After all, the top-of-the-line boots are actually suitable for any outfit.
Whether it is a skirt, a pizz, a skirt or a knit, the simple leather or synthetic leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good in party clothes and casual clothes.
The black boots of the upper generation are perfect for the hottest outfits.
They perfectly balance the feminine aspect of the pink, floral plumage and the graceful, bulging needle.
Fresh but stylish, a casual, autumnal outfit for a romantic flavor.
A strong and somewhat retro outfit is made up of a long copper-brown velvet skirt, top-of-the-line boots, flashy earrings and a stringed briefcase.
While the top-of-the-line boots have a certain sophistication, they also perfectly match casual everyday wear with a t-shirt, long shorts, and a trendy bag.
It's so easy and yet so classy!
Two robotic cars start to move in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and will take passengers, the city of Espoo said.
The sample robot cars will act as a bus simulator, as the area is due to be opened to robot bus traffic next spring.
The project will develop and pilot year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical performance of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars can survive on the current street grid.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop the technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, head of transport management.
For the first time, robotic cars will move in the middle of other traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The occupant of the vehicle shall always be responsible for the safety of the vehicle.
Vehicles constantly sense their surroundings with a number of sensors and assess whether the lane is clear.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or a snowflake, for example, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotic transport.
The robot cars will run three days a week throughout the autumn: Tuesdays at 13.30 and 15.30, Wednesdays at 10.15 and Thursdays at 10.15.
The robotic cars will stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
You can tell when a robot car stops by the stop signs.
The safest way to get on board is at the number one stop on Otaka Lake.
The bass player from the band Mokoma fell off the stage in the middle of a gig and got injured.
The Mokoma group is reporting on their Facebook page the unexpected situation with the Tampere Warehouse gig.
The Mokoma band's concert at the Tampere Pack Room took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage during the performance.
It happened when the band was recording the last song of the night.
The guy broke his shoulder.
The band is announcing the news on their Facebook page.
"We are in the mood!"
The bastard tripped on stage at the Packing Room last night in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's wish the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour is a backup act, it says on the sidelines.
The fans of Mokoma are responding with concern to the photo update, where the bassist Santtu is lying on the bed with a cast in his hand.
This is the news we've been waiting for. There was a lot of concern about how bad it was.
It's a relief, the bones are healing, thankfully.
Cheers and a quick recovery for Santa and a good tour for the rest of the band plus the new tour leader!
And thanks for yesterday, it was a great gig, but you promise to keep this kind of dramatic ending out of your gigs in the future?
Police monitored the hunting in Northern Karelia and Savoy
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Forest Authority and the Finnish Predation Centre in North Karelia and Upper Sava, the police department's security personnel said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the controls was on the legality and legality of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, the licences for hunting weapons and the permitted cartridge levels for the use of self-loading weapons for canal surveying were checked.
According to the police, during the inspection, 112 hunters were checked and only one hunter was found without the required hunting license.
The hunter was given a 12-day fine for unauthorized possession.
In addition, police blew up 133 drivers of the vehicle, two of whom are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols handled five traffic violations in a fine-tolling, police-style manner.
In conclusion, hunters are very good at hunting permits.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone had checked the permits".
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting surveillance in the autumn together with other control authorities.
Mykkyne is going to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
Finland has decided to take in 530 Syrian refugees from refugee camps in Turkey this year.
The selection trips are usually held twice a year and involve representatives from the Immigration Office, the Ministry of Labour and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey for interviews.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly vulnerable position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, the disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group of people coming to Finland than are in the quota, because in practice some do not arrive for various reasons.
Mykkinen also meets with Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soyl and NGOs working on the Syrian border.
The trip also includes Interior Ministry Chief of Staff Ilkka Salmi.
The quota increase is discussed
Finland has been accepting quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was set at 1 050 for a few years, but no agreement has been reached by the government to raise it since then.
The House has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has recently fallen to the opposition of the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota for 1 500 to 2 000 persons per year.
Mykkäse's visit is the first one by the Home Secretary during this term to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The former interior ministers Petteri Orpo (co.) and Paula Risikko (co.) were able to move into their new posts before the visits could be arranged.
Finland will receive EUR 10 000 from the EU for each refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now we're going to the wrong place. We don't know whether to laugh or cry.
Last Saturday, the Karja newspaper reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill prohibits in principle the keeping of all animals not specifically authorized by ministerial regulations as livestock, pets or other enterprises.
So everything else is prohibited in principle except the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill becomes law, it will mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities which endanger the security of society or good manners.
We are now proposing a general ban on all activities which are not specifically authorized by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example in business, and nothing else can be done until a law or regulation has been passed to approve it.
The government's legislative activity has been generally weak.
If we go down the road where everything is forbidden in Finland, where everything is not allowed separately, we don't know whether to laugh or cry.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act needs an update.
But this is not a democratic bill.
I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder if it would approve this kind of procedure of 'everything is forbidden except what is specifically authorized by law or regulation'.
I hope there is some sensible minister who will stop this kind of legislation from progressing.
Metti Forssell says the four most trendy trends of the fall
This fall's trendy outfit is coming in snake shells.
It looks particularly good in the skirts.
Combine the snake-like skirt with the top of a dress, such as a polo shirt or a regular T-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.
This fall, silk is abundant, and silk-cloth is one of the most fashionable items of the season.
Combine the gorgeous silk with the sophisticated feminine top or relax in a pair of needles.
Silk hams can be used to play with courage and throw on shoes or trendy cowboy boots.
Whether it's gray, brown or multi-colored, all square skirts are now part of every woman's must-have underwear.
Be bold in combining different colors and in playing with the square, even at the top of the square.
For example, the combination of a square and a sphere is beautiful.
Asymmetrical beads are a breeze from the summer light that you can take with you into the fall.
The asymmetrical bead is feminine and playful at the same time, and it is perfect for both a party and a party.
Baby Alexia, three months, cuddling sweetly in Jere's arms
In the family portrait of the Karalahti, the center of attention is the sweet three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells us about the Aito Day Home, which was founded by Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice skater Jere Karalahti, 43, had a family addition in early July.
Their firstborn, Jax, turned two in May, while little Alex is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti and Martina Aitolehde recently held a training camp in Marbella, Spain, with the entire Karalahti family.
Nanna posted a picture on Instagram of the Spanish atmosphere, with the entire Karalahde family posing.
The children, Jax and Alex, are in their parents' arms.
The attention is drawn to the sweetly moaning baby Alexia, who rests in Father Jere's arms.
I'm grateful for this.
Grateful for kindness, forgiveness, people's generosity and joy, Nanna Karalahti writes in the background of the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti, who has become a public figure through the Fitness Diaries programme, and former ice hockey player Jere Karalahti recently went into the daycare business and opened the Aito Daycare in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahti, the company also includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for the education side.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the day care director.
Turkey urges people to charge their mobile phones in case of a storm
The storm, which hit Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of Greece in particular about the storm on Saturday, reports CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens early Saturday night to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet connectivity is up, so people can get up-to-date status updates, local news agency Anadolu Ajansi reported.
People are being told to stay indoors and away from windows, and to move garden furniture, for example, out of the way of the wind.
Turkey is expected to experience heavy rainfall and wind gusts of 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for the southern Greek regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies in Greece warned Finnish people in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were urged to follow weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
A while ago, when I contacted you, it was raining and windy.
People were calm, Laura Aaltonen, communications director at Tui Travel told STT on Saturday.
Aaltone described the situation as similar to what happened on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Foreign Ministry had also received no messages from Finns in distress.
In Greece, several ports were closed to ships on Saturday, local news agency Amna reported.
The sea-going cruises were cancelled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and sea traffic were expected.
Finnair was told on Saturday that they were actively monitoring the weather.
Kim the Ripper blamed the Mercedes for the Ferrari.
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was forced to admit that Mercedes, the worst competitor, was too tough in the Russian Grand Prix era.
But there is no need to panic at Camp Ferrari, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a huge thing.
Our car was the best in the times of the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth and with team-mate Sebastian Vettel clearly behind the Mercedes speed, said the Rusty.
Ferrari had a tough time in the last race in Singapore.
The man was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than we are. It's as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, I'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don't know that any more than anyone else.
This is a constant guessing game, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
From time to time, a rare treat was seen for the next stable of the Raven, Sauber.
In the next season of the Rampage, Ferrari's replacement Charles Leclerc was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also made it to the final time trial.
The Swedes have their best start in over three years.
And even though as many as five drivers missed the second session altogether, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to the Wild One in view of what's to come?
Yeah, compared to where they were in the first semester, it's a big step forward.
Next year's a different story, so let's see, let's see.
It was Robert Helenius knocking Erkan Teper out.
The match between Robert Helenius and Erka Teper at Stuttgart last night went down in a row.
The German was the more proactive player in the ring, but he didn't get any good shots.
The far more extensive Helenius controlled the match with its hard sets, which were well-done.
The Finn was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The final solution came in the eighth inning when Helenius hit Teper with a left straight.
The blow was so severe that the wrestler, who was fighting in front of a home crowd, did not even try to get up from the mat.
After securing victory, Helenius vented rather moderately.
In the interview, he first praised the good atmosphere the audience created and his opponent.
Then he switched to Finnish for a while.
Thank you to all the viewers and the Finnish cheerleaders.
We brought our belt today.
Helenius was happy after the fight.
It was a huge win for Helenius' career.
"There might even be a chance to get to the World Cup", Helenius told the newspaper before the match.
Instead, the defeat could have ended his boxing career.
Of course it's occurred to me.
This is not getting any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper meeting.
The number of victims in Indonesia could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president is urging people to prepare for a sharp rise in the number of victims.
According to the country's Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are searching for trapped people and also for the dead in the worst-affected areas of Sulawesi Island: the port city of Palun and its neighbouring district of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are Palus, and the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are seriously injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palus has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the cries of people trapped in the rubble, but a lack of excavation equipment has delayed the start of the rescue effort.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to conduct rescue and excavation operations.
The military and its equipment are needed because electricity and communications are cut off in many places in the disaster area.
We're running out of fuel, too.
The Miss Finland finalist's hesitant answer and long reflection caused a barrage of laughter.
The Miss Finland pageant is currently being held in Billnäsin Ruuk.
In the interview round, each Miss Finalist was asked a question.
The finalists asked about the glass cup on the stage.
In particular, the hesitant response of number six, Emilia Anttikosken, 23, caused a sweet but good-natured laugh in the audience.
The question to Anttikosk was sent via Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the last book the Miss Finalist has read.
Ant-Man thought about his answer for a good while before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for asking, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I read was... the ant-dog said he was thinking.
The audience laughed until Anttioski continued his reply:
The last book I read was...
I've read books in school!
It's probably something to do with economics.
So the last book I read was "Someone in Economics", Anttick answered.
After his answer, Anttikoski received a rousing applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the mission tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in his underwear because of his principles.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9pm, with last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm giving up the crown.
That 's why the apple-peanut cake takes the tongue away
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples on your own, for the domestic apple is in stores at shocking prices.
You might have to buy a pear tree, although I think a lot of people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can also be made with apples only if you don't want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more varied if you add the pear to the cake.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seeds.
He was a bit late.
Melt the butter in the pot.
Butter the eggs and sugar into a foam, and then add the cornmeal and melt the butter.
Mix the corn starch, or corn, and the baking powder and add them as a spell.
Add the almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Roll the bread with a loaf of breadcrumbs, spread 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the dough, and spread slices of pear over the sugar.
Splash half the spell on the pear slices and the apple slices on the spell.
Spoon the rest on the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is a beautiful brown.
Let it cool in a year, then undo it on the waiter's table.
Cut the cake until it's properly chilled.
The cake is fragile and easily crumbles because of the almond and corn flour in the dough, which are gluten-free.
Love is hosting an international crime literature event in January.
The first international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime fiction will be held in Kuusamon Rukka in January.
The Nordic Noir programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary themes, as well as jazz music.
Literary guests at the festival include the Swedish comic book star Jens Lapidus and the Swedish twins Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, who are also known as Erik Axel Sund.
Besides Swedish names, the event will also see writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organizers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide the framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have identified two types of "coolness" that are slightly different: generally attractive coolness and the opposite, dissent-coolness.
The researchers described the "attractive cool" people as having many of the traits that were considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, agreeable, and competent.
The dissenters, on the other hand, were characterized by aloofness, independence, rebellion, and spite.
They were thirsty for experience and cared little for outside judgments.
Both types combined a good sense of self with a stable emotional life.
The role of the tough guy is not cool anymore: high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 U.S. study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who dated early, flirted, went to the good-looking crowd, and sought to be liked by others were at an increased risk of drug abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships they were worse off than their more inconspicuous contemporaries.
High-status luxury cars, branded boxes or watches do not make you cool - or at least truly attractive companions.
A study published in the August issue of Social Psychological and Personality Science found that the majority of people were more willing to befriend a regular marketer than those wearing a trademark shirt - even though most chose to wear a trademark shirt when they met.
If you're on a Greek island, be careful!
There 's a terrible storm coming , and the weather warnings are calling for red .
During the weekend, in southern Greece, it can rain as much as it does in Finland on average during the six months of the year.
The Zorbas storm is hitting Greece this weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades, or Crete.
The storm is extremely strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens is announcing it on its Facebook page.
According to the press service, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather alert for the areas.
The forecast of the storm is also being reported on Foreca's blog.
It says the storm's strongest gusts are up to 150 feet per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm that hit Finland earlier this week was blowing at a peak of 31 meters per second.
However, according to the blog, the biggest concern for the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
Over the weekend, the southern part of Greece could see more than 300 millimeters of water.
This is about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
Hurricane Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the Love Island Duck that the men are salivating?
He appears in some very disturbing YouTube videos.
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beauty Anku, who is drawn by several men, also appears in the weird YouTube videos released in 2010 as a handkerchief-wiped.
In the video, Monkey advises the fishermen to make inkfish from old paper money.
The duck also shows in its sympathetic style how a weed can be plucked from the socks and grow the right spikes.
Now, we're going to grow the Easter herbs, but we're going to do it in a slightly surprising way, and Monkey is going to hint at sawdust, sockpants, and the seeds of the willow tree, which he's going to use to make a hedgehog.

Valtteri Bottas was shaking and spitting adrenaline in Sochi. Is he going to be Hamilton's sidekick on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking a little bit after the Russian Grand Prix, when he was in front of the media.
The fine lap left Mercedes' number one Lewis Hamilton behind and was certainly a critical moment for the Finnish rider who has been racking up a lot of money this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the middle of the decision cycle.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little, Bottas made it.
I've only been to the stake once this year, in Austria (mid-spring), so it's been a while.
This track has been good to me before, and I got good laps again.
The Sochi track is not easy to pass, so the start is particularly important.
And of course, Bottas was asked to answer the question of whether he's driving for the win tomorrow or whether he's facing the upcoming World Championship by Hamilton.
My starting point in this race is definitely to try and win.
There can be no other purpose when you leave the stake, Bottas stake.
But in the studio, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis' lead on Sebastian Vettel is pretty big, and the gap between me and him is pretty big, so that's something to keep in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did finish.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of the Boots after the race, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was also pleased.
Lewis was intent on beating Valtter, but he failed in the seventh round.
Valtteri knows he's gonna have to pull everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged, the adrenaline was pouring out of his ears, Wolff was glowing.
Asked if the team would allow Botts and Hamilton to drive on the track, Wolff responded with a dodgy look.
We'll talk about it in the morning, see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from the Cities of Kiel won the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM Series of rally cars rarely ended.
Hardly ever before have the brothers finished as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now, in the final round, which was held in Turku and Salon, the windsurfers Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen did it, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik won the SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen from Kiel secured the best result of his career when he finished third in the Finnish championship in the SM4 two-seater class.
Honda Civic racer Kinnunen and road racer Ville Mäkelä started the Tour semi-finals in a slow start, because the starting points were clear: placing in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the two had to make a draw when some of the extra lights failed in another special test.
That was a pretty blinker shot for the third one.
It's not a good idea to be a little bit of a dickhead in a situation like this.
On Saturday, only the second in the series, Jussi Tepo, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Ministry is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign forces are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home.
But there is no end in sight to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
The European Union has also been involved in the negotiations with the United States and the United States.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court drama on TV.
Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his harassment prosecutor, Professor Christine Blasey Ford, had an unusually large number of people on the sidelines.
The full-scale drama of the U.S. Supreme Court's nomination of a justice drew at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Donald Trump, and the California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee, telling their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were watched by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six major channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to these, millions more were heard online.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched the live stream, and CNN reported that it set a record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN's number rises to over 10 million, including those who follow the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also got an 8.0 million launch.
The digital launches are owned by the channels, the TV viewership figures are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen's gonna release the final numbers on Monday, but they're still pretty crazy.
Seldom more than 20 million
The more than 20 million viewers in the United States are usually limited to sports matches, the major entertainment events of the Oscars and Grammys, and occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
The most watched annual event in the United States, the NFL Finals, the Super Bowl, is on the way.
This year, the Super Bowl drew an estimated 103 million people to NBC.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump's first speech to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people and the inauguration by a whopping 30 million people.
The most important thing
The appointment of a Supreme Court justice is an extremely important case in the United States, since the office is for life.
Trump had already appointed one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans were able to prevent then-President Barack Obama from nominating his successor.
The second seat was opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was on many issues the so-called Wa'ang language, whose vote could decide the position of the nine-judge court.
She was a supporter of abortion rights and sexual minority rights, and in 2015, for example, she voted to give same-sex couples marriage rights across the federal government.
Kavanaugh is considerably more conservative in his views.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock the court's conservative grip for decades.
Children have the right to know their parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children's health data on the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Of course, the original situation in Kanta was even more worrying: parents were not even allowed to see the health information or prescriptions for young children.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
Since then, the practice has been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an astonishing amount of time to correct.
Now, we're looking at a repair in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change in the legal basis should not have been more than a rallying cry.
Then, in the layman's understanding, it's a matter of pressing a button: now when the lid is held closed, it's opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents the information if he or she has a bank account or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
The ID card is a charge, and the bank codes aren't even for a 10-year-old.
So, basically, nobody can see the data of a fourth-grade elementary school unless they ask for it in print.
It is not so much a question of parental rights as it is a question of children's rights.
It is vital that parents be involved in the care of a child.
Naturally, the right to privacy of teenagers must be respected.
Even minors may have family situations where all matters cannot be discussed freely.
Often they relate to sexual health, which is a deeply meaningful human right to be cared for freely.
In the United States, the FBI began investigating allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media reports, the FBI is investigating at least two women's allegations of harassment.
One of the women was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of sexual harassment during his college days.
President Donald Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited criminal investigation, and it may not be made public.
A man threatened to kill police officers at the police station in Kajaan
The imprisoned rapist continued to play the fiddle even in the closet.
Police say they put the man in police custody to "calm down".
Police were threatened by a suspected assailant on the night before Saturday in Kajaan.
Authorities are reporting a case that began when a man in his 30s violently challenged a dispute at a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside the food court.
And then I was kicked out of the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by knocking him to the ground.
When the third party tried to intervene, he still hit her.
The triple arrest led to the call to the police.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police say they've transferred the man to police custody to "calm down".
The man is charged with three counts of assault and one count of aggravated assault.
Aid organizations prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid agencies are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF's communications director for Finland.
Local authorities are leading the rescue effort, but the need for additional assistance is already apparent at this stage.
UNICEF is active in almost all countries, and we have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to its normal operations, UNICEF is always fully prepared for emergencies, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the city of Palun, Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala region, a little further north, the situation is more unclear.
There are still places where the lines don't work.
Aid efforts are difficult because roads are also cut off, says Haru.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is heavy.
Once survivors are found, they need shelter - first, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in a crisis.
First, people can usually be offered water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
Water systems are repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported first, for example by truck.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
One of UNICEF's missions is to find family members and reunite families.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), a United Nations agency.
In the initial phase, the funds raised will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF has already started a fundraiser to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, among other things.
As chairman of Tesla , billionaire Elon Musk will end the $20 million fine for tweets .
Elon Musk, the founder of the space rocket and electric car companies, is avoiding fraud charges with a deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk is stepping down as chairman of Tesla's electric car company and agrees to pay $20 million in fines.
Musk is avoiding the job as part of a deal he made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By doing so, Musk will avoid charges of fraud.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission threatened Musk with securities fraud because of tweets he posted in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to pull Tesla, the electric car company, off the stock market, which caused the company's stock price to rise sharply.
Under the terms of the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as chairman of Tesla's board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new 'independent member' to its board of directors and add two 'independent directors' to its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk can still remain CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fine, Tesla will also pay the equivalent of $20 million to the financial regulator.
The tweets misled investors.
The SEC said Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he had secured the financing to buy Tesla back from the stock market as a private equity company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would be bought out of the stock market for $420.
Tesla's stock price rose more than 10% in the 24 hours after the tweets, but then dropped.
The SEC said Musk's allegations were baseless.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the financing he claimed.
Nor had he discussed withdrawal with the other management team or the board of directors.
This week, Friday, the stock market fell 14 percent after the SEC announced a fraud charge.
The agreement is expected to reinforce the company's direction.
The final verdict is not the reason
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the wise men are not moving.
It's a technical glitch.
The clock in the cathedral tower in Helsinki has stopped.
The time is 12 noon.
It's like a normal horror movie, when the crypt of a church is full of prophecy and the pipes are playing by themselves.
Of course not, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
A repairman has been to check it, but some parts are broken and a new one is waiting, says Eveliina Jamsen, a nun.
Meanwhile, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account says that the final judgment is not the reason the clock stops.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of a malfunction.
