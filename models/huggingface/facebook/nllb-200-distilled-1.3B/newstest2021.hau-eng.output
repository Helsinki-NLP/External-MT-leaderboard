The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing 40 new coronavirus medicines submitted by traditional medicine manufacturers.

Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, traditional medicine formulators have been doing research to ensure that they are not left behind in the development of a combination of drugs.
Many of them have submitted their product to the authorities for testing and evaluation.

The efficacy of the drugs will be tested on animals for the first time.
Mojisola warned pharmacists not to try any drug without the approval of the agency.
In May, NAFDAC stated that only on social media and newspaper pages are the stories of claimants who claim to have discovered a traditional cure for the Coronavirus.
Adeyeye explained that only one person approached NAFDAC to request to check the quality of the drug which he claimed to be a combination of traditional medicines, which he said could cure the Coronavirus.

APC Accuses Governor of Niger of Trying to Bring Chaos to the Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers
In a statement released by the APC on Tuesday, it accused the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of trying to create unrest in the party.
The document, signed by the President of the Engineering Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Barista Party Muhammed Liman, states that, during the six years the party has been in power in the state, it has received only N512 million.
The paper further said that the meeting of stakeholders convened by the governor, which he chaired on Sunday night last weekend, will help to continue the unrest in the party, which they said had written to the party's national secretary about the ongoing events in the state.
According to Injiniya Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Niger State is trying to divide the heads of the party by organizing a meeting of stakeholders, which is illegal, because any complaints against the party leaders, are written to the secretariat of the party by the state, so that they can investigate".
He further said that so far in the six years of the party's existence, N512 million has been in the party's account.
He said, what he understood as governor was to be in the National Advisory Committee set up on July 25, 2020, headed by the president to lead the resolution of problems among the party members and withdraw the court complaints among the party members.
What money we have earned to pay the salaries of the party secretary, and other services related to the party, the dismissal of elections and to solve other problems of the party members such as health care benefits due to lack of access to government subsidies, not any party money we have spent illegally, we challenge anyone to bring us a justification for the destruction of party funds.
As I explained, the last state local elections, the most important primary election ever held in the country, which we held with former and current commissioners in all 25 local governments of the state, whose expenses were shared by the commissioners to bring their constituents.
So, it is wrong for anyone to say that party funds are being spent illegally, it is almost unfair to try to give a bad name to the defendant to try to hang him, saying that no committee should be set up to investigate how the party funds are spent and who set it up.
Of the money that the complainant claimed that the money he allegedly misappropriated was money provided by the secretariat of the national party, not any other money so I challenge anyone on this issue who brings his testimony to prove his allegation in any way.
Imam said that we stand firm in protecting the APC from any attempt by anyone or any group to disrupt the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be registered to the regional committee as per the party constitution as stated in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party constitution.
The party stakeholders therefore have no role to play especially if they attempt to seize the power of the committee and so their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the legitimate party leaders who have been recognized in the state, in article 21 and paragraph 6 of page 87 of the party constitution, any violation of this shall not be used.
Because the decision to discourage them and the leaders who hold them back is wrong.
He said, those who submitted with the formal approval the letter at the unconfirmed meeting, which was presented by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Arabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party executive committee in the state.
The executive committee of the water and power party will be headed by the party president, Injiniya Mohammed Imam, and not the governor, who will lead the state party leadership.
The letter added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the state during the election, and taking the party leaders into the government so that everyone in the state and all sectors would benefit by giving political posts, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The letter praised the federal lawmakers for refusing to attend the meeting and called for reconciliation on all issues between the party members, which was not surprising for the lawmakers who were aware of their own pain, and refused to accept the dictatorship as the party policy.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Resistance Committee to appeal to Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the proper position not to try to corrupt the state politics.

How food additives are affecting the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists warn against foods that contain food additives because such foods are harmful to one's health.
The experts issued this warning after a study on the quality of food in the country.
The results of the study suggest that some foods are preserved by adding chemicals to prevent spoilage.
The study also found that the chemical is commonly used in beans, pork and dried fish.
The ingredient is used to make the product more appealing to the eye.
Eating foods that contain this chemical can cause cancer, kidney disease, heart attack, and so on.
The people of the country were urged to be careful about using these types of foods for their health.
Not to be forgotten, food safety expert Grace Olasumbo has urged Nigerians to avoid eating vegetables that have been ground with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo explained that Calcium Carbide is the chemical most commonly used by traders to grind raw vegetables, i.e. vegetables.
Research shows that impatience and greed are among the factors that lead businessmen to use this chemical because it produces a day's worth of fruit.
Olasumbo explained that something that marketers fail to understand is that using this chemical to display vegetables is harmful to human health.
As a result, infections include vomiting and diarrhea, eye pain, stomach ulcers, throat, mouth, liver and other conditions.

The head of the African Development Bank was cleared of blame - Freedom Radio Nigeria
An expert panel headed by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has acquitted African Development Bank (AfDB) President Akinwumi Adesina.

The US had previously insisted that Mr Adesina be investigated on the allegations, following his acquittal by the AfDB board of directors, which led to the formation of an expert committee to investigate the scandal.

On Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he had canceled the Republican National Convention scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, due to the surge in coronavirus cases.

China Achieves Achievements in Enriching Its People with Food - Leadership English Newspapers
Food is the life-giving spirit of all living things, and food alone is not enough to sustain life.
This is why the Chinese authorities are increasingly focused on ensuring the country's food security.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has made remarkable progress in food security, which has shocked the world given the country's population, which is estimated to be over 1.4 billion.
This effort has contributed significantly to China's contribution to the eradication of world hunger, as the head of the China Grain and Crop Protection Agency Zhang Wufeng once stated that, since 1949, China has always placed the fight against hunger at the forefront of all its policies.
But recently, some people and some Western media have again "expressed concern" about the question of whether China can raise its own nation in the shadow of the global COVID-19 respiratory crisis.
We are very grateful to the newcomers for their daily concern for the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country achieved a per capita food production of enough food for its efforts.
The issue of providing enough food for the Chinese is one of the main agendas of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Last weekend, the secretary general of the JKS Supreme Committee, Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a major order to stop food waste, pointing out that everyone knows that every grain of food is hard to come by.
Although this year the impact of the global COVID-19 respiratory epidemic is also affecting the Chinese economy, China can still produce enough food for its people.
The figures released by the China Statistics Bureau on the country's agricultural output, mainly rice, for the year 2020 show that the country's rice production in the first quarter of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, or 3.9% compared to the same period of 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, former president of the Chinese Agricultural University, said China has made great progress in terms of food production compared to the early stages of implementing the domestic reform and opening up policy.
Huang Jikun, director of the China Agricultural Policy Research Institute at Peking University, said in an interview with The China Science Daily that the biggest challenge China now faces is whether in the next two to three years, China can reduce its wheat and rice stocks in grain warehouses.
Now the annual yield per person is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that should be produced per person worldwide.
And now China imports millions of tons of other agricultural products just for livestock.
So those who express concern should calm down, take a bath, and go to bed, or simply concentrate on their domestic affairs.
The Chinese can support themselves with food they produce themselves.

The only requirement is, to launch the recruitment process in 2023.
Brother and close friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura said that the current model of governance in Nigeria is outdated.
Mamman Daura said Nigeria has already made progress in abandoning the recruitment system to focus on selecting the most qualified candidate in 2023.
BBC Hausa published an interview with Mamman Daura in which he said the following.
This system of taking part in presidential elections in Nigeria has not produced the eye-catching child that was started in 1999.
Instead, Daura says that the focus should be on selecting the best candidate, not on the same selection process.
However, the Igbo people, the Inyamirai, reacted to Daura's comments.
They said that he and his brother President Buhari would only be able to win the presidency by a landslide and then he would come out now saying he recommends not to do so in 2023.
Buhari himself was not the most elected Nigerian.
The top security officers of the country who have been sitting on their seats for decades without being removed, are also not more capable than others.
The reaction of the Amorites.
A political storm over the Nigerian presidency erupted on Wednesday, as the Igbo Tribal Interest Defence Association Zalla, Ndigbo dismantled Mamman Daura, over the Nigerian president's comments against the Inyamurai tribe.
In an interview with Daura, who is the nephew of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that a party-list system will be in place for the 2023 presidential election.
On this occasion, as his remarks were not finished reading on social media, Ndigbo quickly issued a statement to criticize Mamman Daura, calling him a racist fat-head.
In a statement released by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo people's union is only for the Southern Region, and in the near future the South East Region will be allowed to nominate a president in the 2023 elections, that is, the Igbo people.
The spokesperson of Igbo Zalla Tribal Association, Emeka Attamah said Mamman Daura's comments were like a presidential election in 2023 against the Igbo.
Apart from greed, why did Mamman Daura not talk about acceptance since 2019.
They have fired Jonathan, and now Daura is in the southern region to pick who will lead Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
He will only finish the leak from his brother, the current president of the country, and then come up with an unknown issue of acceptance in 2023.

VOA's Rape Room.
The issue of rape against women and children is widespread in northern Nigeria where there are reports of children being denied their rights.
People from various sectors gathered in the hall on July 23 to discuss the worsening situation in the country and how to overcome it.

Contribution of 'Northern Media Writers' to the Northern Alliance.
Modern social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Banpresdamiya and others, have long played a role in providing forums for discussion, cooperation and friendship among different global communities, as well as delivering messages, news, and disseminating political, educational and business policies.
Young people in Nigeria are engaging in this new technology by using social media, keeping up with the latest trends, contributing or spitting out their own opinions on the latest news that affects their lives.
We can say that these forums have brought us many advances that Northern youth are benefiting from in business, economy, education and politics of the region.
Many earn their living by sending e-mails, finding jobs, or promoting their businesses.
But it is sad to see that some youths instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to benefit from the progress, some are found to follow the corrupt youth of the southern country who are world leaders in corrupting the public, inside and outside the country, or writing scandalous and abusive articles about the rulers and the ancestors.
The lack of civilization is reflected in the development of the youth of this country.
The arrival of the Northern Media Writers in the country is a great blessing, to provide the Northern youth with a sense of direction and to refine the activities of the youth in Social Media, so that they can become meaningful writers and spread the ideas of the Northern society.
It is imperative that we give this organization the cooperation it needs, to achieve its benevolent goals, which will benefit not only our Northern region, but also Nigeria as a whole.
I urge our youth, especially social media users, to come together to defend the North's integrity and independence, and to create a system that will be inclusive.
As our Northern leaders who lay to right like Sardaunan Sakkwato, the first Northern Prime Minister Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his close associates aspired to provide for the Northern people.
It is said that the late anti-oppression and poverty activist Malam Aminu Kano, once said, Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, while we call for national development and improving governance, at every level, we are calling for unity of the people of the North, without discrimination of religion or ethnicity, to bring our region forward.
When we look at the North, it is not the same now.
So we should use our God-given skills to provide assistance and advice, to provide the North with a satisfactory path to economic recovery.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to spend money.
In addition to the development of the North, we have to give importance to education, agriculture, tourism, healthcare and science and technology.
In addition to gifts of money, there are other ways to give.
We believe that this is how the North will fulfill the dream of our ancestors!
The North is our pride.
We do well to reflect on the way men were used to write the Bible.

NNPC Revenue of $378.42 Million from Gas in June.
The Nigerian Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has reported that its total export revenue in June was $378.42 million, up from $133.16 million in May this year.
The Nigerian oil company added that this was the highest tax revenue received since the global outbreak of the coronavirus, which led to the imposition of a traffic ban and a drop in oil prices in the global market.
In a statement signed by the company's Chief Public Relations Officer, Dr. Kennie Obateru, NNPC said that, during the month, NNPC added that it had generated revenues from oil and gas drilling of $4.60 billion between June 2019 and June 2020.
Similarly, the company reported a total revenue of $378.42 million from oil and gas exports in June 2020, up from $133.16 million in May 2020.
As the company previously disclosed, it earned $230.65 million from the oil spill, while the total was $75.97 million and $71.80 million.
The company's financial report for June 2020 was the 59th monthly financial report published by the company.
The report said that between June 2019 and June 2020, $4.60 billion in oil and gas leakage was recorded.
The report also shows that, to ensure the successful delivery and distribution of oil across the country in June 2020, NNPC allocated 1.34 billion litres of oil.
The report said, 950.67 million litres of oil were sold in May 2020, as a result of the curfew imposed in the country, which has led to disruption of business.
According to the report, in June 2020, over 1.3 million litres of oil were sold, while 5.10 million litres of gas were sold, and 1.65 million litres of coal were produced, which were distributed nationwide.
Overall between June 2019 and June 2020, over 19.104 billion litres of oil were sold, making gas sales over 18.9 billion litres or 99.36%.
The report said that the total oil sales in June 2020 amounted to N134.22 billion, compared to May 2020 which was N92.58.

Punishing Rape in Nigeria Is Not the Only Solution - Husbands
A class activist in Kaduna state Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje pointed out that the death penalty for rape in the country, especially in Northern Nigeria, is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje announced this in an interview with Leadership Adag in Kaduna, adding that, if the authorities confirm this after investigating, the death penalty is the only solution.
He added that the decision would reduce the number of rape cases that could easily be found, but the biggest thing is to change our hearts.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said, "It is in our Muslim tradition to pray to Allah, pray to the Prophet, stand up and change our hearts, because every day one does not know when he will die".
It is a shame that a full grown man or an elderly man should find a little girl or a three-month-old girl, three or five years old and rape her.
He goes on to say that, in God's eyes, we should not speak abusively of rulers, or national authorities, implying that such a form of corruption would be unlikely to fail.
He added that this is why we are in a state of misery and suffering in the country, because the country refuses to progress, the Kings and Governors and the President themselves, have no way to deal with the situation.
He added that they had sewn the bar and a new one had been opened, so we had to change our hearts so that God would bring us a solution to the rape case.
He declared that even if they were for the sake of idols, everything should be left to God because he is the one who removes all sorrow and poverty from the nations.
He said that no matter what the situation, God knows you and you can do nothing but ask for forgiveness and always think about dying and always think about being in the past, if you were born.
He pointed out that the police officially are also doing their best because they are sending the same rape suspects to the Magistrates Court to do their best to this which has become a tragedy, in our region of Northern Nigeria and in the country.
He urged parents to keep a close eye on their children, citing the advertising of how their parents are pushing them to do so.
He said that some parents do not follow the life of their children whether they go to school or not, whether they come home on time or not, adding that the fault is in part the negligence of some parents because they should know that God gave them children and tomorrow he will ask them about what kind of education they gave their children.

Biniwe's sugarcane farmers expect more harvests in the autumn - Leadership Hausa Newspapers
Rice farmers in Biniwe State expect a good harvest about two months after planting.
Some of them tattooed in Makurdi express hope that the harvest will be anytime between October and November.
A small farmer in the state's Mbatiab-Gboko town, Titus Atondo, said he planted his first rice in a two-hectare area in July.
Atondo said he obtained the seeds from the local market and they belong to two groups of CP and OC rice while he used Dazzle to clear the fields for planting and fertilizer.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of rice cultivation in rural areas such as the mine are many because we are so dependent on labour as customers cannot access the farm roads.
Titus Atondo added that we hire people to farm from the ground level to harvest, adding that this is exhausting and too much.
Atondo said the total cost of his farm which currently includes planting, clearing, fertiliser application and their harvest is expected to be N2020,000.
Titus Atondo went on to say, however, that he expected at least 50 bags as a harvest from two acres and probably would sell for N29,000 per 100k bag.
He is also a large rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, planted in June to July on 274 acres of land with a price tag of N14,500 per acre while the land cost N25,000 per hectare.
He planted 44 varieties (Supi) and 61 varieties (OC) obtained from the National Agricultural Certificate Council (seeds) and some originated from Olam Nigeria Company.
He added that the growth stages at this stage are in different stages while some are in the breeding phase, while others are in the early stages of slaughtering animals as farming is done in stages.
Tarnongu added, the challenges so far include financial ones as the cost of producing the selected animals is expensive and the labor costs have increased.
The harvest was expected to begin in October or November.
He added that the total cost of raw materials at the end of the day will be at a minimum of N246,000 per hectare while production is expected to be three tonnes which could translate to N360,000 at a rate of N120 per kilogram.
Tarnongu does not use pesticides on his rice farm, instead, he recommends and practices traditional farming, adding that, therefore, we use highly effective herbicides, insecticides and medicinal fertilizers.
Also the President of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) Benue State Branch, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, expressed hope that the rainy season this year will be suitable for a large rice crop.
According to the President of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) of Benue State, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers were involved in rice cultivation later this year due to the coronavirus crisis which prevented many from leaving offices and staying in their fields.
He said, this year it will harvest 20 percent of the production in 2019 which is estimated to be over one million tons.
According to him, data collectors are currently taking statistics of various farmers and once the project is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The president of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) Benue State Branch, Comrade Aondongu Saaku who said he has planted three acres of rice fields, noted that some farmers plant rice in June while those who are short-term farmers do so in the same time period as the expected harvest in late November or early December.
The head of AFAN added that rice farmers use chemical pesticides to kill old weeds, pesticides and pesticides.
He expressed concern about the challenge of wild animals threatening rice cultivation, adding that farmers are building fences, installing ropes and clearing the edges of the fields to combat the problem.

Commenting during the meeting, the State Environment Commissioner Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, said that apart from the spraying they have done in government and private sectors and businesses, so far they have distributed more than 70,000 nasal swabs.

He Was a Sad King, Praised by Critics
Beyonce's music video "Black is King" continues to receive praise and criticism worldwide for its portrayal of African culture.
In South Africa, where the 85-minute film was shown, many considered it even better.
Black is King is a musical film directed, written, composed and produced by American singer-songwriter Beyoncé.
The film was notable for its song "The Lion King: The Gift".
The film was shot in the United States, South and West Africa, and Europe, and it featured several African musicians.
The film, released in July, was well received by audiences, but it was also criticized.
Some say that Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas, U.S., borrowed African elements illegally, especially the African-oriented images in the film, while traditionally it has no African roots.
In South Africa, however, even the people who played a part in the film were happy.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student of film studies, said that he was honored to be included in the cast.
He said that he was impressed.
The film covered many things about black history that were not taught in school.
He said that the first time he saw the film, he saw the story, the dress, and the whole plot, which was far more than he could have imagined.
Kgosi Motosoane, a fan of Beyonce's music, said African Americans abroad - including black Americans - have the opportunity to use what some see as African cultural assets.
He said he was interested in the film.
Kgosi said black women were often relegated to the lower echelons of society.
So their success in such high-profile matters is encouraging.
Film student Mathebula said Beyonce's film made him want to start making a documentary film to spread awareness about Africa.
African Beyonce fans have a common theme: If Black Man is King, Beyonce is Queen.

Minister Sadiya commends journalists and aid workers.
Nigeria's Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouk, commended the efforts of the media, humanitarian workers and cooperative agencies as her ministry celebrates its one year anniversary.
The agency was created by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 21, 2019 to implement policies and humanitarian activities, disaster prevention and emergency relief, and to administer humanitarian aid programs.
In a statement shared by the Assistant Minister for Women in Media Halima Oyelade, the minister considered that this year was a year of many achievements, full of challenges and excitement in which we learned about public assistance and disaster management, but in all the projects we focused on fulfilling our mandate which consisted of reaching out to the community, preventing disasters and helping the victims of disasters, and coming up with ways to reduce the suffering of disasters, which helped to improve our future work.
While congratulating the President on his vision of creating a ministry that is at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouk thanked him for putting her in the driver's seat of the ministry.
She also feels that during that one year, she has learned valuable lessons and gained a new understanding of the practical and the impractical aspects of this work.
While praising the media, the minister said the villages are traveling companions with whom it is necessary to join forces to succeed.
She said, "I want to assure you today that you are doing a good job".
She also said that while it is not her department that gives her own marks for her achievements, she and her colleagues are ready to continue their work in a spirit of dedication and commitment to fulfill their mission commitments, which coincides with their one-year anniversary theme, Service2Humanity.
The Minister paid special tribute to "the humanitarian workers and our partners in this sector from UN agencies such as OCHA, IOM, UNHCR and the Commission; World Food, World Bank, USAID and European Union (EU), and other partners who continue to provide relief despite the current insecurity and hardships they face.
It also recorded the number of deaths in insecure areas in the past year.
The minister explained that the one year anniversary of the establishment of the ministry has forced them to take a stand.
"As we celebrate our first anniversary", she wrote, "I would like to say that it is time to resume our efforts".
We must find ways to expand our response to disasters, to provide relief, and to develop social support programs that will help us to improve our work in the future.

Just as farmers in Nigeria are about to reap the benefits of their crops, farmers in Sokoto state are struggling to cope with the threat of bird attacks, which could threaten the hoped-for harvest.
The threat of red-cockaded woodpeckers in the Sokoto State region is on the decline, given that there are signs of a good food season this year.
Forced, some local farmers adopted a traditional method of chasing the birds as explained by a young man named Faruk from Dange Shuni region.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, said the birds are now destroying all the crops that are growing in the fields.
The president of the Nigerian Farmers Union Sokoto State Branch, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that two-thirds of Sokoto State is currently suffering from this problem.
He also said that they are now waiting to hear the situation of the local governments in the state to put together a report to send to the state and federal agriculture ministry to take action to help farmers.
Federal Agriculture Department official in charge of the department of poultry and insect medicine, Yau Maeker Kagara, said less than a month after the spraying of the poultry killer in Sokoto region was completed.
He added that the birds are imported from Niger and Benin, and international agreements must be reached before cooperation can be achieved.
In June the federal government launched a bird killing spraying operation in 12 northern states of Nigeria that are neighbouring and overseas countries through which the birds enter Nigeria.
But the re-emergence of the crisis could set back the clock on the apparent progress in agriculture, which governments claim to be paying special attention to.

New COVID-19 Support Bill to be reintroduced in the US.
As figures show that the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in the United States, Republicans in the Senate are expected to introduce a funding bill on Monday.
The aid is expected to reach $1 trillion to alleviate the suffering caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan comes days before the first round of financial aid for millions of Americans who lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic expires.
On Sunday, after days of negotiations with Republicans in the House of Representatives, US House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the aid included an expansion of the benefits program for job losers.
But according to them, this time, Americans will see 70 percent of the money they were given before.
On Friday, the first aid period expires and the compensation package for those who lost their jobs will be extended to 600 per week in addition to the state allowance.
The Republicans complain that the plan means that some people are being paid more than they were paid during their working hours, when combined with federal and state subsidies.
But "Democrats, for their part, challenged this pledge saying that given the rapid spread of the coronavirus, some employees are not comfortable returning to work.

The Federal Government has launched a farm plan to produce food and employment.
The Federal Government has launched the Agricultural Plan for Food Production and Employment (AFGP), which is a subset of the Economic Sustainability Guarantee Scheme.
This agricultural programme was launched to alleviate the hardship of farmers due to the Coronavirus outbreak.
This was stated by the Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, during the launch of the program in Katsina.
The announcement was made by the press spokesperson of the Ministry of Agriculture, Ezeaja Ikemefuna, on Thursday.
The initiative will address the social pressures caused by the Coronavirus outbreak in the country and around the world.
The program will also further promote farmers' access to food production, processing and transportation in Nigeria.
The Minister as reported, said that the launch event was representing over 1,100,000 smallholder farmers across the country.
He said that these more than 1,100,000 smallholder farmers are part of the Farmers' Group under 6 companies including AFEX, BabanGona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agric and Oxfam.
Soon we will identify a second group, Group B, of those who will benefit from this agricultural program.
Nanono recalled how President Muhammadu Buhari established the Economic Recovery and Marketing Committee from the disabilities he experienced after the Coronavirus outbreak.
He said one of the ways to revive the country's economy, including the AFJP Program, is to develop agriculture from a hands-on-hand-picking farming to a modern and productive food production.
He said the plan included the government's plan to distribute up to 100,000 metric tons of food to the poor during the coronavirus outbreak.
He said that within a year this massive initiative is expected to create 5 to 10 million jobs for youth.
It will also produce about 10 million metric tons of food per hectare from 20,000 to 100,000 per state, for at least 2.4 million farmers.

How the Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to take down the PREMIUM TIMES website on the internet.
Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has taken on a veteran hacker, to take down PREMIUM TIMES, the leading online newspaper in Nigeria.
This Internet hack expert tried every trick that hackers use to gain access to their sites, but without success.
He started his hacking experiment on February 28, where he dropped his malicious tool on the campus of the university, and used the university's "data" to launch his attacks.
On the other hand, if he tries to hack the PREMIUM TIMES network and computer, he will be attacked again with his GSM phone.
He spent five days trying to open the PREMIUM TIMES Main Page, but failed, despite using a number of advanced technologies.
He failed to break in, because the university was unaware that PREMIUM TIMES had a master plan in place, which built a massive and strong bridge that no lifeguard could break through.
PREMIUM also has a number of heroic security officers on its main website including the PREMIUM TIMES Warlord and the Chief of Staff, the PREMIUM TIMES Web Shield.
These security officers are highly skilled in crushing any gang or other gangsters who try to go rogue alone, or to make a martyr-like attempt to break into the PREMIUM TIMES database.
The weapons used by the hacker to attack PREMIUM TIMES:
At 8am he started to slide the door of the PREMIUM TIMES Archives, because he saw how he could shoot into it, destroying the entire archive.
If he failed that night, the next morning, at 6:15 he tested his luck again, this time using "WPScan", a technique used to detect the strength or weakness of security measures for adult websites like PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began to experiment with the power of modern computer technology, "custom script".
It was morning and he tried everything he could through the computer to shut down the PREMIUM TIMES website completely.
How a Farmer Treats Monkey Flu:
This hacker did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had been working on a plan to combat small rats and large cities that were entering the farms of social networks and hacking the page cover or taking over the site of the scammer.
This ignorance of his is why all the weapons he used, mostly ex-convicts, could not harm PREMIUM TIMES.
On that day he suffered in vain and tired because he went through a DDOS attack in NTP Likau Rariar, which is an old road used since Kano village.
On March 3 he tried all the remaining tactics in his brain and mind, but all failed.
The move comes just days after PREMIUM TIMES reported on a clash between President Muhammadu Buhari's National Security Advisor, Babagana Monguno and former Chief of Staff of the President's Office, the late Abba Kyari.
Some in the Federal University of Technology in Akure, have told PREMIUM TIMES that the university has hired a hacker to hack, destroy or destroy the PREMIUM TIMES website and database.
However, after PREMIUM TIMES contacted FUTA University, it distanced itself from the attempt to attack the PREMIUM TIMES Internet Archive.
FUTA says that unless a single student at the university tries to do it alone, FUTA is not a good fit.

The Selfishness of the Heart - Leadership English Newspapers
In Longyuan Village of Hongsipu District of Wuzhong City, Ningxia Province of the Hui Autonomous Region, in northwestern China.
Li Yaomei, or Sadiya (her Muslim name), was a hardworking woman known for her struggle and success in her efforts to break free from poverty.
Her story tells us that effort, persistence, and selfishness are things that come from the heart.
Initially, she was Li Yaomei or Sadiya, never sitting in class with the intention of taking lessons, which made her unable to read or write.
But God gave her a gift of insight, intelligence, and great wisdom, which made her a model in combating poverty.
About 20 years ago, Mrs. Li Yaomei, who had been suffering from stomach cancer, had to undergo three stomach operations.
When she regained consciousness, she had a terrible accident, this time with a metal brace on her leg.
These challenges left her in a difficult situation not only regarding her health, but also regarding medical expenses, which is why she accepted a loan of about 3,300 thousand yuan, equivalent to over 16 million Naira.
Ironically, this challenge turned into a way for Sadiya to be bullied and abused to improve her life.
But the Chinese government's financial support gave her a boost.
Her trade was to harvest various types of grass.
Thanks to her husband's efforts, Dad's business prospered, with various companies ordering her wool.
She also invented a number of machines that made the work easier.
For example, she used to take 15 minutes to string together one large spider, but now she can string together five spiders in the same amount of time.
She also invented a new machine that cleaned the grass and turned it into a grasshopper.
Then there were the other machines that cleaned her animal feed, and she still sells these machines to the prospective growers.
Given the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she still makes to improve her and her staff's lives, it is understandable that the applicant must be in a position to find it.
The fight against poverty and the improvement of living conditions are not the only things that governments can do.
If governmental aid is provided, but people lack the ability or the desire to improve their living conditions by finding jobs that are appropriate to their circumstances, then the future will be a vacuum.
Her experience shows that running a business or a lucrative business does not require large sums of money or long trips to other cities or foreign countries.

This is another lesson that shows that trust is not a sure thing.
Ma'am Sadiya was a very hardworking, intelligent and intelligent woman who set an example and a model for others.
Also, by March this year, Malama Sadiya had completed the payment of all debts, and then stopped receiving government subsidies on her own account.

There is fear that US politicians will undermine efforts to contain COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Recently, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed concern over the measures taken by some countries to delay the production of COVID-19 respiratory vaccine, stating that preference should be avoided for different countries, as the vaccine is shared.
And vaccines should be distributed equitably around the world, as this would be in the best interest of different countries.
Indeed, some US politicians are pursuing a self-serving policy of sharing vaccines, and are undermining international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
Among them, more than 800,000 died from the disease.
Under such a critical environment, there is increasing focus on the effectiveness of vaccines, and fortunately, in recent times, there have been significant results in vaccine studies in other countries, which have given hope, and confidence to the entire international community.
But sadly, some US politicians have expressed a desire to get the vaccine.
Science magazine even clarified that the US government has already signed contracts to purchase COVID-19 vaccines worth over $6 billion from several pharmaceutical companies.
While the US government's policy is understood, with the US being the leading cause of the spread, other developing countries also need vaccines, given that they are more affected by the lack of health resources.
"The Ecologist" magazine also pointed out that if the United States achieves its goal of eliminating vaccine production, the number of vaccines needed to be produced in developing countries will decrease.
Kazaika, the director general of the African Centre for Disease Control CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over the issue.
As some commentators have pointed out, even if a vaccine is successfully developed, it is impossible to achieve the goal of post-pandemic vision without a coordinated distribution of the vaccine, which is a matter of international importance.
And international cooperation is needed.
WHO Director-General Tedros also pointed out that if the pandemic is to be seen to be over, it must be contained from all quarters around the world, as it is not possible for some parts of the world, or a few countries, to achieve the goal of recovery from the effects of the pandemic alone.

South African President condemns the contracting process.
The South African president has made a statement condemning the rampant corruption in the ruling ANC.
Cyril Ramaphosa, in a letter he wrote yesterday Sunday 23 August, sent to all members of the ANC, began by raising the issue of the award of contracts to help the country fight the coronavirus.
The cause of the crisis is that there are private companies and individuals, including government officials, who have exploited the medical, social and economic crisis to make a living, according to the letter.
This deception will not be forgiven by millions of South Africans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, facing daily hunger, and unemployment.
In the letter Ramaphosa also wrote that millions of dollars of national money should be spent on improving transportation, providing infrastructure for the poor, and improving electricity, helping black farmers to thrive and developing the entire country, which the bad guys have stolen and put in their pockets.
President Ramaphosa said the public should not think that the ANC is just a means to gain power, wealth and influence.

Nigeria is facing the worst economic recession this year.
Published on: 24/08/2020 - 16:33
The Nigerian Statistics Authority announced that the country's economy has experienced its worst recession in 10 years, as a result of a recession that exceeded the 6 percent seen between April and June this year.
Figures released today by the Commission show that between April and June, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of normal business, Nigeria's economy entered a period of unprecedented growth between 2010 and 2020.
The agency listed the causes of the crisis as including the imposition of lockdowns across the country, restrictions on traffic and restrictions on air travel and closure of schools and businesses.
The agency added that such measures taken internationally have led to a sharp drop in oil prices, while factories have been closed globally to deal with the crisis.
In May, Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed said the Statistics Commission had predicted a similar situation as a result of these problems that hampered the day-to-day operations, forcing the government to revise its budget.

Akpabio has broken an egg on the contract of Nigerian lawmakers.
Minister of Development of Niger Delta Region in Nigeria, Godswill Akpabio has revealed the names of the members of the NDDC's Legislative Council who have been awarded the contract to carry out several major projects.
This comes at a time when the heads of the Niger Delta Regional Development Authority NDDC are accused of embezzling vast amounts of money.
Among the names of the members of the parliament who received the contracts was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Niger Delta Region, Peter Nwabaoshi who received a list of 53 contracts as announced by Minister Akpabio.
Mr Akpabio also said that Senator Mathew Urhoghide has won six contracts, while Senator James Manager also received six contracts, while former Senator, Samuel Anyanwu received 19.
Also the former chairman of the House of Representatives Committee in charge of the NDDC Commission, Nicholas Mutu, received 74 contracts, which is the highest number as revealed by Akpabio in a series of documents sent to the committee investigating allegations of bribery in the Niger Delta Regional Development Authority.
There are also a small number of MPs from Ondo and Edo who have received contracts from the NDDC.
The documents released by Akpabio show that most of the contracts were awarded in 2018, but the amount of money spent on them was not disclosed.
This comes after the Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila threatened to sue Akpabio for allegedly trying to defame the members of the House.

Yobe Spends More Than N78.8m to Revive Leda - Leadership Hausa Newspapers
The efforts of the Yobe State Government, under Governor Mai Mala Buni in reviving the state-owned Yobe State Polythene Bag and Woben sacks Company, after spending over 10 years in a state of inactivity, were praised.
This was stated by the General Manager of the company, Engineer Shaaibu Adamu Gadaka, in a conversation with our representative at his office in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, earlier this week.
He said the company had been locked for over 10 years, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was difficult to resolve to revive it, who immediately ordered the removal of N78.8 million to repair critical parts of the company and an additional N48 million to run it, while allowing the company to get on its feet.
Eng. Gadaka further explained that this has enabled them to purchase the necessary equipment for starting the company, which includes a new 500 KbA Generator, 500 KbA Transformer, new bag cutter, bag sewing machine (modern) and other equipment required by the company.
He then added, "To this day, the main objective of this initiative of Governor Buni, in reviving this company is to create jobs for young people, reduce the number of unemployed and provide income to the state of Yobe".

On the other hand, he said, "There are some challenges we face, due to the fact that the company has been in lockdown for over 10 years, while the machines are working but we need to replace them with other products to be able to operate without any fear".
We wait until our work is done, and we try to bring in the rest of the supplies we need.
Furthermore, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we are asking the Yobe government to provide us with more equipment, trucks and vehicles to carry out our activities more easily, especially for transporting our employees to the office to avoid being late, when we start working too hard".
He also said that in the current situation, the company has sent 25 young people to get training on how to operate machines and machines and control the products used in the company's operations and how to deal with the business community they interact with.
He said that the company has now started producing leather bags in different colours, including 100kg, 50kg and 25kg size and offering a range of leather bags to the merchants depending on the colour and condition of the bags they want, the company is ready to satisfy them.

2,732 people killed in April and June in Nigeria - Report
An estimated 2,732 people were murdered in Nigeria in just two months, from April to June.
The report, released by Lagos-based SBM intelligence, said it had compiled the data from reports published by various newspapers in the country.
The report compiled statistics from newspapers including mass killings, including by Boko Haram, killings by hostage-takers, "gun-toting", pastoral attacks and near-tribal and rural killings.
