Welsh MPs are concerned about 'Muppet' images
There is resistance among some members of the Assembly to the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Welsh MP).
The reason for this is that it is planned to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
All the AMs involved in politics are worried that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour AM said that his group was concerned that it should not be linked to the Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A plaid AM said the whole group was "not happy" and suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independent" about the name change, but noted that the MWP could be matched by a slight verbal change in the words.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u in Yorkshire English pronunciation.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the law on the name change, said: "The final decision of any explanator as to what the members of the Assembly are called will certainly be a matter for the members themselves".
According to the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission was informed of the results of public consultation on proposals which had received significant support for changing the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the AM title, the Commission supported the Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the most support in public advice was for the MWP option.
Obviously, AM is suggesting several other options, but it is having a hard time getting consensus for Presiding Officer Ellen Jones, who hopes to submit a legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
The legislation being prepared for the changes will also include other changes in the working methods in the Assembly, including the formulation of rules and committee system for disqualification of AMs.
The AM will get the last vote on the question of what they should be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians are going to hold a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was bid to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name refers to its province and has repeatedly objected to its bids for membership in the EU and NATO.
A Macedonian president, a rival to the referendum on the name change, says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zev and supporters of the referendum have argued that the name change is merely a means of joining the EU and NATO.
The church bells of St. Martin's are ringing less and less because of the shrinking number of churches in Harlem.
"The elders I spoke to for history", said Mr. Adams, "say that there used to be bars and churches on every corner".
"Today, it is all coming to an end".
He said that the reduction of bar is understandable.
"Today, people are forming a society in a different way.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room that people go to every day".
As for the churches, they are concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders hope, "and that soon the money will run out or later those leaders will return to exactly where they started".
He further added that churches may have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings with a variety of people living there, which would not help to preserve the remaining places of worship in the vicinity.
"These buildings will continue to attract more people to buy property rights and so there will come a time when these churches will be closed down completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who are coming to them with property rights will become members of these churches.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin, both churches were built by white members of the religious community before Harlem became the Black Metropolis - Metropolitan Community.
The original white members of the Methodist religious society moved in the 1930s.
These buildings were taken over by the black members of the religious community who worshipped at the nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was taken over by a black religious society under the pastor John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, a prime place for shopping in Harlem, where opposition to hiring or promoting black people was rampant.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but after the followers of Father Johnson planned to rebuild it, the bells were rung.
Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's successor, Father David Johnson, proudly called the bells "the doors of fortune for the poor".
The expert who played the bell in July described it as something like this: "It is a cultural heritage" and "a precious historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the world's first bell played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who played a very large bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather explained that no other person was put in his place at St. Martin.
What happened in St Martin in the last few months became a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of them appointed by the general leaders of the church and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
Vestry (where the objects of worship are kept) came under the control of the parish (the clergy of the district) made up of common leaders - in July the province expressed concern that the province would "seek to meet the costs" for Vestry, regardless of whether Vestry was involved in hiring the craftsmen and contractors employed in the province.
Some clergy in the area complained of the lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old teenager was injured by a shark attack while diving to catch a crab.
Officials say a 13-year-old teenager was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while diving in California on the opening day of lobster season.
The attack took place before 7 am near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel of KSWB-TV in San Diego said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and then he and a group of others reached out to get him out of the water.
Hummel said that at first he felt as if the boy had been shouting in excitement about catching the crab, but then he felt that he was shouting, 'Something is biting me!
Something is biting me!'
Hummel said that when he saw the boy he found that the boy 's entire hipbone had been broken.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" said Hummel.
The teenager was admitted to San Diego's Ready Children's Hospital where his condition is being described as critical.
The species of the attacking shark has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gills told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found to be not a dangerous species of shark.
Gills further said that the victim's upper torso was severely injured.
For investigation and security purposes, the authorities have blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casblade to Swamish Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours.
Gills said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to incorporate department store style Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by hiring expert assistants with beauty products.
Despite continued declines in fashion and home goods sales, it is going to join the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market with good volume, these bulk beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if this plan is successful, the business will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in supermarkets, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing in TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double its product offering by bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
Supermarkets are also re-launching their boutique makeup products, so that most products are vegan-friendly - this will somewhat accelerate demand among small shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrances Shop will also test the special feature at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second is due to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
In the shift of decreasing daily food volumes in online shopping and local convenience stores, more and more efforts are being made to increase visits.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coop, said that outlets like department stores will be more crowded as the supermarket chain tries to compete with Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food discounts.
Sainsbury's is installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has opened several more stores since it brought in both chains two years ago, which shows that grocery sales have been boosted and the deal has been made more profitable.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to bring beauty and pharmacy products back to the market had failed.
Sainsbury's had been in business with Boots in the early 2000s, but had to end the merger because of the way in which the supermarket distributed the revenues from the drug stores.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores of pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125 million, after which a new strategy emerged.
It was informed that Lloyds will play a key role in the scheme by connecting La Roche-Posay and Vichy along with several top luxury skincare brands in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and colour of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained colleagues to help us with advice.
We have tailored our brand to fit the needs of each individual and attractive environment and in more convenient locations, which means we have reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones expresses his disappointment at the departure of Holly Willoughby from the £11 million deal
When TV presenter Holly Billuby decided to walk away from the £11 million deal for Dragons Den star Peter Jones's lifestyle brand business, Peter Jones expressed his displeasure at the decision to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Billubi has no time for its homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of these two was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow 's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old morning presenter announced the split on Instagram.
Holly Billuby separated herself from her lucrative lifestyle brand business with Dragons Den star Peter Jones at the last minute - so she could focus fully on her new best-seller contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources revealed that when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at Jones' business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that she was breaking off her new deal - worth £1.5 million - Jones expressed outrage at this, meaning that Billubi no longer had enough time to deliver her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow 's brand Goop and was being considered to double the estimated £ 11 million offered by Willuby.
Willubee, 37, announced on Instagram that she was breaking up with Truly after Jones left the UK to move into one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was always at the top of Holly's priorities.
This was seen as its long-term future, which would take the brand a long way over the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was very close to starting.
The warehouse at Marlowe HQ is full of stuff that needs to be sold".
Experts believe that the departure of the morning presenter, Britain's richest star, could cost the firm millions as it has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear and is also likely to delay its launch.
At the same time, it can also end a long friendship.
Bilub's three children and husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for the past ten years.
Willoubi started Truly in 2016 with Cap and joined as Chairman in March with 52-year-old Jones.
The vacationing couple and Jones own 40% of Baldwin 's TV production company.
Billubi has now become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin to host ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night a source close to Jones said, "We don't want to talk about his business dealings".
'And then we agreed'
He joked that the news media would continue to comment on him, some would consider it a "separate job from the presidency" and would be too positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so many sacrifices?
Trump told in his fancy "news anchor" voice.
"I have not given up anything".
He said Kim's interest in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, the first meeting was a major step taken by Trump to make North Korea nuclear free.
But the nuclear - free talks were stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not waiting for a "consistent response" from the U.S. to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
He said the US has continued to press for the sanctions to be maintained instead.
Trump's rally speech was seen as too optimistic.
"We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Our relationship has become very good now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - including completing rocket tests, helping to free hostages and returning surviving U.S. troops to their homes.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
Pointing directly at the crowd in front of him, Trump said, "It's very easy to stay in office, but with 10,000 people from outside the country trying to join this territory, we'll only have about 200 people to stop them".
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastated an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need them.
Despite the devastation of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national disaster was declared, and a condition was placed for international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, it was clear to them that they were not seeking international help, so it became a little too challenging", Ms. Sumba said.
Nevertheless, Save the Children visited Palu with a team, but it is not yet certain whether staff from other countries can come to help.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu, looking to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the situations that have repeatedly occurred in Indonesia, it seems that the country is not preparing for the outbreak of nature at all.
Although there are shelters for tsunami victims in Aich, they are not like shelters on other beaches.
The warning sirens for tsunami in Palu have been reduced, however damaging the warning may be, this is likely to increase the loss of life.
No matter what the best time to visit is, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Providing maidens and goods is always complicated by natural disasters.
The earthquake victims are being brought to a hospital in Lombok for treatment, which is far from Palu and takes at least three days to reach from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's poor infrastructure an issue for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration was dispersed by lack of funds as a re-election is due next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought each other in the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge mysteriously leans in to tie with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday to save Liverpool from relegation from the Premier League.
From about 30 yards Sturridge got a pass from Zerdán Shakiri, at the time his team was 1-0 behind Chelsea on goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making a far post shot.
His effort moved to the top right corner of the net with the height above the box.
The ball eventually fell out of Kepa Arizabaluga 's grasp and went into the net.
"It was just trying to get in the position to get in contact with the ball and get it as far away from players like Schack as possible, so I just tried to take as much time as possible for myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the thorns coming and I touched once and didn't think much about it and just shot".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after Belgium's best player, Aiden Hazard, scored in the 25th minute.
Before the ball reached the midfield and reached the Liverpool half game, the Blues striker passed Matteo Kovasić in that game.
Kovacic delivered the ball very quickly in midfield.
Then, he made a beautiful shot on the ball, which sent Hazard into the box.
Hazard came out of the defence and sent Liverpool's Alison Baker off the back of the net with a left foot shot.
Liverpool will now face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face each other at the UEFA Europa League in London at 3pm on Thursday at Videotron.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The country's disaster agency reported early Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference that several people were reported to be trapped in the rubble due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and 20 feet high tsunami on Friday.
In the city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, several buildings collapsed, leaving the city in ruins.
Police have detained a 32-year-old man, suspected of stabbing a woman to death.
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was recovered in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am in John Street, Grayson Muse, with stab wounds on her body, in this context a 32-year-old man is suspected of the feat who was taken into custody.
Police questioned people living in the area and tried to find out if anyone had seen or heard anything in this context.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation has begun, but I would like to appeal to those who were present in the area around John Street in Birkhead at the time of the incident, if any of them suspected seeing or hearing about the incident, to contact us.
I would also appeal to those, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was recovered from the local area of Birkenhead and found inside a property.
This afternoon, people who knew the woman arrived at the scene and asked where her body was found this morning.
Police are investigating the incident and they say they will brief the victim's family members soon.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse is trying to evacuate his flat right now, but police have reported that no one is allowed inside or outside the building.
When he found out about the incident, he was silent.
People living nearby are now being told that it will take a few hours to return to the old state.

The statue of Cromwell in front of Parliament recently became the most famous monument, re-recorded in history.
Its expulsion would be the perfect justice for the destruction of many of England 's cultural and religious artifacts created by its radical Puritan followers like the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The ongoing debate over the removal of the statues was full of the fear that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
The emblem of the English Civil War was neither commissioned nor built by Cromwell.
It may be mistaken that Cromwell would have sacrificed for the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorcroft, Cromwell's best representation is evidence of 19th century thought and part of the history of a statue that many still consider admirable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps because most people still remember him as the defender of Parliament against outside pressure in the late 19th century in the matter of monarchy.
Nevertheless, they are considered to be the exact representatives, which historically remains a matter of debate.
It is clear that our nation has been evolving since the conflicts of the mid-17th century, and Cromwell's statue remains a personal identity reflecting one aspect of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and memorable.
Deadly pig attacks Chinese farmer, killing the farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer at a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, whose surname was only identified as "Yuan", was found with serious injuries, covered in blood near a pigsty in the market of Liupansu, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinhai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen.
He reportedly came to the market on Wednesday with his cousin living in the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, her cousin died and a pigsty door was found open nearby.
He said that a large male pig appeared in the pigsty with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig attacked and killed the farmer.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, his cousin, nicknamed Wu, said, "My cousin's feet were bloodstained and completely bruised.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig that attacked and killed the person was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been kept in a cage to prevent it from attacking anyone, although police had inspected the scene and gathered evidence.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of pig attacks on humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer on his tractor, attacking the farmer until his wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, an Oregon farmer was attacked by his pigs and killed and made his own food, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" when they taste blood.
"They are just playing.
They bite with their teeth and are very picky... they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosas recorded winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning Eastern Time, a Category 1 storm, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trench is forming over the Pacific Ocean and is moving toward the U.S. west coast. Since Rosa is set to approach the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, much of the northern regions of the southwestern United States will begin to receive tropical moisture.
On Monday, some parts of Mexico will get 10 inches of rain due to Rosa.
After that, the moisture coming from the trough will combine with tropical moisture in the coming days to bring heavy rain to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will lead to dangerous flooding, debris runoff and landslides in the desert.
Excessive tropical humidity will cause rainfall to be 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Most of the southwestern parts, especially Arizona, are likely to get 2 to 4 inches of rain.
The sporadic nature of tropical rainfall can lead to severe flooding with poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical rainfall, it will be highly advised to stay out of low-level desert.
Heavy rains can cause valleys to become dangerous rivers and clouds to thunder, as well as strong winds and dust to blow over local areas.
The coming trough will bring locally heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
Over half an inch of rain is likely to fall, which may lead to some debris runoff and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Some sporadic tropical rains will begin in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the rain becomes more extensive on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain will fall in Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures can change rapidly throughout the U.S. during the month of October, as the Arctic weather cools, but the tropics are quite warm.
Sometimes this short distance causes strange changes in temperature.
The strange change in temperature in the central U.S. on Sunday is a prime example.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the heat will cause the weather to warm and the heat will increase.
Warmer weather is expected from October in most of the central and eastern U.S. that can be wide 80s in some areas from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate that there is a good chance that temperatures in the eastern U.S. will be above average in the first six months of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people attended the Supreme Court on Thursday to watch the trial of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly committed in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Blasey Ford, the hearing was shown on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political standoff was also witnessed, with broadcasters halting Friday's regular program Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineered by Arizona Sen. The lawsuit was filed by FBI's Jeff Flake after a week of investigating the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that at a high school party, Cavanough had drugged him and tried to strip him.
Cavanough defended himself by saying that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen at all.
It is estimated that over 20.4 million people watched Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was calculating average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it were not immediately available.
Also, usually Nielsen has some difficulty in counting the people he sees in offices.
In this perspective, it is the same as the number of spectators at a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Nielsen said Fox News, which the presenter strongly supported Cavanough's appointment, was ahead of all other channels, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings.
ABC had 3.26 million viewers and was in second place.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen said.
The interest in the hearing was very high.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
A statement issued by the Liberal Republican office after the term said they would speak out on behalf of Kavanaugh, who appeared on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, shouting at the time to protest the Judiciary Committee hearings.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes while he was being called a blasphemer, which was seen live on CNN.
One woman said, "Lizzie, I'm standing here in front of you.
"Do you think they are telling the country the right thing?
They were asked, "Were you brought into power to disempower a lot of women?"
Flake said a statement was issued from his office before the elevator was shut down and said that he would be able to speak fully at the committee hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was pushing Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote to the full Senate, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live several hours later.
But, Flake said, they would do so with the full understanding that the FBI will look into the charges against the named individuals next week, which is being urged by the minority Democrats.
Flake discussed this with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake loved power, for it was clear that approving Kavanaugh without scrutiny would not win the Republican vote.
President Trump has approved an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politicising" Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May told critics to stop playing politics as a game in the EU and focus on the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29th September 2018.
Right next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper was an interview with his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress the attack on himself because of the so - called Chequers plan for Brexit, his statement that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other which is "totally pointless".
Wade Sims shot: Police have detained a suspect in the death of LSU player Dayton Simpson
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old Wade LSU basketball player.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been taken into custody and sent to jail on charges of second-degree murder.
A video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson was released by authorities, and police reported that Sims' glasses were lost during the encounter.
Police have recovered the glasses from the scene and reported that according to the WAFB report linked to CBS, the DNA was found to be Simpson's.
The police, interrogating Simpson, reported that he fatally shot Wade to death.
Advocate's report said that he has been set at $ 350,000 for this.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local people for cooperating in the investigation for the detention.
LSU athletic director Joe Allaeva thanked the law enforcement in the area for its "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 6 feet 6 inches tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne lives, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season's game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported on Friday morning that the team was "dispersed" and "very sad" by Wade's death.
"There will always be a concern about who will replace him", said Wade.
Volcanic ash found in Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have been found in the southern areas of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano, noting 183 gas and ash leaks in 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring many shocks and vibrations.
Photos posted on social media showed thin layers of ash-coated car windshields in neighborhoods like Exochimilco, Mexico City.
In September 2017, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico, since when geophysicists have been paying attention to the increasing activity of the volcano which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the Capitol.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists in Catalonia on the occasion of the Independence Vote Anniversary
Six Barcelona residents were detained after clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police on Saturday, and thousands of rivals joined demonstrations on the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists threw eggs and powdered paint at riot police, blacking the road dust, usually causing inconvenience to commuters.
The police used their batons to control the clash and later engaged in a skirmish.
Pro-independence groups chanted "No forget, no forgive" for several hours while federal protesters chanted "Let Spain live forever".
According to local press reports, 14 people injured by the demonstration were treated.
The referendum, which Madrid said was illegal, has been heating up tensions in the liberal areas for a year, but Catalonia's separatists were celebrating it.
The voters for independence chose a very good path, although there were few who strongly opposed the vote against secession.
Catalan officials said that around 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from moving to polling stations in the area amid clashes.
The pro-independence groups stayed overnight on Friday to assist the National Police in stopping the demonstration.
The demonstration was postponed, but he was forced to make a different decision.
Narcisse Terminus, a 68-year-old electrician who arrived with his wife to take part in the separatist protests, said he saw no prospect of Catalonia becoming independent.
Our best year was last year.
I had seen my parents expressing their happiness by voting, but it seems we are stuck now", he said.
Despite minor victories in regional elections in December last year, Catalonia's pro-independence parties struggled to maintain influence this year with many of their most prominent leaders, whether it was in exposing themselves or waiting for a blockade for their role in organizing the ballot and continuing the proclamation of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to help the police, said the clashes between politicians on both sides had been stopped.
He said, "It 's become too stressful. "
On Saturday Orol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Fighting the European elections as a candidate is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the return we have seen in the Spanish government", he said.
London: Car attackers arrested in the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been detained for repeated car attacks on a London Derry home.
The incident took place at about 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballinagard Crescent.

In some places Crosbo may have been attacked by a car.
Menga won against Rangers to give Livingston a 1-0 win.
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured the victory of Livingston.
According to the manager of Ibrox, the fast-paced Livingston stunned the Rangers, leaving Steven Gerrard to take responsibility for only his second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike created the gap that was equaled by Gary Holt's side move with Hibernian in the second half of the match.
Gerrard's side are one step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the leaders Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Earlier, on Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston is winning back-to-back in the six-game division with the addition of head coach Holt to replace Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed showing his game to the Visitor
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their great game caused Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record but missed the goal attempt, then Allen Lithgow slipped and was able to stay straight, trying his best to complete the goal in Craig Hulket's head.
The hosts got a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could get the visitors in trouble on the set piece.
And it was this method that gave him the important goal.
The Rangers got a free kick and Livingston opened, Declan Gallegare and Robinson set up Menga, who scored a touchdown and from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had strengthened their position, but missed out on home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely behind,
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on Kelly being saved.
Scott Pittman's shot was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor with his feet and Lythgoe took full control of the game by flicking from the second Livingston.
Crosses continued to come and go in the Livingston box, while two penalty claims were made after Halcett's challenge, one involving bringing in Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
Livingston's 'extraordinary goal' is analyzed
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland is joined at Tony McCarthy Arena
Livingston 's outstanding performance and results.
For anyone, he was excellent, he has continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His playing style and personality have changed dramatically since his return from the top flight, but most credit goes to the way Holt has redefined the team since his arrival.
There were many great players.
Captain Hulkett was the best player, he saved brilliantly, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell involved behind him.
However, the Rangers lacked learning.
The kind of good performances he has done many times under Gerard were below his standards.
They were short of the final ball - they only managed to cut to their home side open once - and it was like some wake-up call for the Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdogan received a warm welcome in Cologne
When the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, there were smiles but no results.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations with NATO allies.
They became embroiled in controversies over a range of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's elevation to the EU.
After that, Erdogan spoke about building a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside Turkey, the city is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.
Police prevented the 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters - some of them Kurds - who were opposed to Erdogan also chanted slogans, strongly condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The two - way protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom saw him as a German - Turkish hero and others who insulted him as a self - disposed ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed by car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST in the south-east of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped the car and gave him first aid, but the person died at the scene.
Another cyclist died a few months ago in a hit-and-run on Children's Street, about a mile from the accident site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and provide information to his family.
The incidents are being caused by road bends and bus diversion and drivers are advised to avoid such areas.
Long Latrine Prison: Six officers injured due to disturbance
The prison office said that six prison officers were injured due to the disorder in the prison of the high security men.
Something went wrong at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The disorder has been called in by specialist "Tornado" officers, the disorder is in a wing that houses eight prisoners.
The rights had minor facial injuries at the scene which were treated.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to repair the accident at HMP Long Lartin.
The injuries of six employees have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons at all, and it is obvious that those responsible for violence will be referred to the police and may be imprisoned.
More than 500 prisoners are held in the HMP Long Lartin, some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was attacked by a prisoner, after which the prison governor was treated in hospital.
In addition, riot officers were called to the jail in October last year to fix a serious disorder, during which the employee was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (due to benefiting dry areas)
The threat remains in the tropics after Rosa hits Arizona, but it is already highly likely that it is the storm's remaining capacity that could affect the desert Southwest in the coming weeks that is causing the risk of severe flooding.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada in western Arizona, southeastern California and Utah, were in danger of severe flooding.
The rain on Monday evening is expected to send Rosa straight through Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted, "Since 1950 ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical storm or depression status!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the AZ limit".
A recent National Hurricane Center model estimated that the Mogollon Rim of Arizona could receive 2 to 4 inches of rain, with a potential of up to 6 inches.
Rainfall is expected to be between 1 and 2 inches in the Central Rockies and Great Basin as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest, with up to 4 inches expected.
Outside of areas at risk of heavy flooding, rose rain can be a blessing because the area is dry.
While flooding remains a serious concern, drought is still present in the Southwest, which is likely to benefit greatly from the rains.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona is severely dry, the second highest category of drought, according to a report by weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa had maximum wind speeds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, at which time it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is now moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific, which is causing it to weaken.
Thus, it is expected that the force of the tropical storm could trigger landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall is likely in some areas of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, it is expected that from Baja California to northwest Sonora, rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, plus, it is likely to be 10 inches.
Rosa then moved northward into a tropical storm Tuesday morning, moving across Mexico before reaching the Arizona border, then moving southward into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat from Rosa or its remnants is to California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rainfall is likely", reports the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that the rains could lead to flooding and debris runoff in the deserts, which could threaten public wealth and lead to landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for conspiracy to murder
A 16-year-old minor in Somerset was found wounded, attacked with a knife for which suspects have been taken into custody in connection with the murder of three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital for treatment where his condition is being reported as "well".
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were taken into custody overnight from the Redstock area.
The officials have also appealed to people to contact anyone who has any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump called the Kavanaugh troubles the Democratic Party's anger
"Judge Kavanaugh is a man who has been rejected by the ruthless and disgraceful tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump told a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says the trouble that Kwanug is going through is the result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared Congress of allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Ford as a teenager decades ago, a fact Kavanaugh has strongly and emotionally denied.
During the hearing, Ford also gave his testimony about the charge.
"The people of America saw that day the virtue and courage of what a great man Cavanaugh was", the president said Saturday.
"Voting for Justice Kavanaugh means voting for a man who is the most accomplished jurist of our time, who can uphold the law and deliver justice with a real record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in medieval elections, the President referred to Cavanaugh's nomination.
We are now only five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I am not involved, but I am actually involved", he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are really qualified".
Trump said Democrats are on a campaign to "opposite and block".
A senior GOP aide told CNN that the first vote count from the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is set to begin on Friday.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, death toll is rising
On Saturday, officials said that when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, high waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died.
A festival was being celebrated on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, with hundreds of people gathered, after the evening when a wave rising six meters (18 feet) high caused havoc, killing many people and destroying everything around them.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami risk hit yesterday, people in the middle were busy with their activities and were not in a position to get out immediately and got stuck", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami not only killed people but also washed cars, logs and houses ashore. The tsunami traveled at 800 km/h (497 mph) over the open sea before hitting the coast", said Nugroho.
He said that some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Photos posted by the Disaster Agency from the air showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were turned and collapsed and a mosque was also surrounded by water.
The reverse shock continued on the rocks in the coastal city on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area experienced the successive earthquakes.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It noted that the geography of the city, which sits on the edge of a long, narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nughroho described the damage as "very terrible" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He said that some bodies were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people are missing.
Ngroho said that the loss of life and damage is likely to be very high in the area called Dongola, which is located 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, near the epicenter.
Nugroho said communications in Dongola were "completely damaged".
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living here and its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
It said, "This is already a tragic event, but it could be even more terrible.
On Saturday the agency criticized why the tsunami was not reported earlier if it was coming to Palu, although officials said a warning was to be issued but the waves had already left.
Some amateur video was made and posted on social media by a person showing the situation on the top floor of the building, a person was being shouted down by people on the street and a dire warning could be heard.
Within minutes, a huge amount of water began to pour out of the middle, sweeping buildings and cars away.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power problems in Palu and cut communications lines, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have started sending cargo planes, officials said, still needing to evacuate people and provide food and other necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will close in October.
The evacuation centres in Palo were to be visited by President Joko Widodo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
This is terrible.
Shri Doseba said that the staff of World Vision in Donggala made every effort to make the city of Palu safe, the staff are living in the shelters in the office premises, they have seen the devastation with their own eyes.
Talking to them, he said, he saw many houses destroyed.
This is terrible.
The relief groups started the work of bringing in relief materials in earnest, some people complained that outside aid workers with special expertise were being denied access to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, money, supplies and personnel can only be taken from abroad if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
But, it has not been done yet.
"The disaster is still at the provincial level", said Auliya Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says OK, this is a national disaster, we can only involve international aid workers in the rescue work but that has not happened yet".
Friends and family members of those who were still unaccounted for in Palu after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday were hoping that their loved ones would be reunited in a miraculous way, as happens after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was found trapped in the sewer.
Rescuers on Sunday pulled a woman out of the wreckage, with her baby stuck in the wreckage for two days.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gandon Subando trained two Asian Games paragliders who had been dedicated to tracking missing people in Indonesia since the beginning of this month.
Mr. Mandgi was also among those trapped at Roa Roa Hotel with his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I too am emotionally pressured.
Mr. Gendon said that the paragliding community started its work immediately after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel, he sent messages via WhatsApp to the Palu competitors participating in the Beach Festival.
However, they only saw gray marks on their messages, not blue marks on this one.
He said, 'I think it means that the messages did not reach the people.'
Thieves stole $26,750 while putting money into an ATM in Newport, Va.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, a Brink employee was pouring money into an ATM in Newport, La., on Friday morning, while thieves stole $26,750.
In the news release, Dett. Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was clearing an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to pour more money.
While he was busy with his work, a man came running from behind the Brink 's employee and ran away with the bag of money that had been kept for the deposit.
According to the news, many people present at the scene are suspected, but the police have not yet been able to determine the total number of people present at the scene.
Anyone who has information relating to his identity should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to this
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to this.
He announced the change on Saturday by tweeting: "Official name will be Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the name Ye for a while and will use it for the title track of his eighth album, Moniker, which will be released in June.
This is a change in his presence on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album Yandy.
The show's producer said he had removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who had refused to join the show for "emotional reasons".
Along with shortening his current professional name, West had already indicated that the word has a religious significance for him.
Speaking with radio host Big Boy about the title of his album earlier this year, West said, "I believe the word 'ye' is used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'.
So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It is derived from the word kanye, which means only one, which is just this - it represents our good, our evil, our delusions, everything.
The album is about who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs also has several names, such as, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has changed his names to Love and Brother Love when announcing for the name.
An old friend of West, Jay-Z, has also changed his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use force against civilians
On the 50th anniversary of the country's deadly retaliation against students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that military force would never again be used against civilians.
At the Teltelco Plaza on Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised that "military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza, killing more than 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help the youth of Mexico, giving grants to students every month and opening a free public university.
He said that due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities, young people are being drawn into the criminal underworld.
The U.S. should double the funding for AI
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI entrepreneur who has invested in Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area.
AI has made this comment after several works by the US government, they also said that the US lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China launched a plan: it aims to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a great start, if you look at all the other countries, the U.S. is way behind on this issue, and we're working on the next big breakthrough for AI", Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, "Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be in the US".
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, an investor in Face++, one of China's best-selling AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the highest-ranked American Othello player, and he later rose to executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee further elaborated on the technical capabilities of the previous U.S. government, including the robotics-related challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said who would be the next government to identify the next visionary.
Lee noted that U.S. researchers often face considerable difficulties in obtaining government aid.
"It's not China that's removing academic leaders, it's corporate", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university veterans to work on AI.
Lee said that the US could help its AI efforts by changing immigration policy.
"I think that permission to do PhD in AI should be given automatically through a green card", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutes in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give financial grants to U.S. researchers, but the quality of teaching in China is not very good", Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, aimed at engaging industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Further, this month DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next which talked about investing $2 billion.
For NSF, right now, this investment is over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, legislation was passed in the US that would ignore the demand for a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians voted on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has led to Greece suspending its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
Greece also has a province called Macedonia, which says its northern neighbor is named after its territory, making two names for the same claim, and is already involved in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents objected, saying that changing the name of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of people living in Slavic.
President George Ivanov said he would not go to the referendum and boycott the campaign, doubting that the minimum 50 percent votes required for this vote would be valid.
The ballot would have read: 'Do you approve of the agreement with Greece for NATO and EU membership?'
Prime Minister Zoran Zev and supporters of the name change say it is necessary for Macedonia to join bodies like the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"Today I come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU because it means a safe life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
Although there is no legal push for it, most members of parliament say they will work to make it decisive depending on the outcome of the vote.
A two - thirds majority is required for a name change in Parliament.
The State Election Commission says that no irregularities were reported as of 1 pm.
However, in 2016 when the last parliamentary election was held, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34%, with 66% of registered voters casting their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gozo Tanewski, a 62 - year - old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zev of Macedonia, accompanied by his wife Zorica and his son Dusko, went to Macedonia to vote for a change in the country's name, so that on September 30, 2018, Stromika, Macedonia, would be named NATO and join the European Union.
Vladimir Kvardarkov, 54, of Skopje, was setting up a small stage in front of the parliament and setting up chairs in front of the tents of those who were going to protest the vote.
"We want NATO and EU membership, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through a deal", Kavadarkov said.
Our country may be poor, but we have our own self - esteem.
If they do not want to join us as Macedonia, then it is no problem, we can join other countries like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zev has said that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
After casting his vote, Zev said, "I think we'll get a very large number of votes in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO".
He said that the "yes" result would "affirm our future".
A survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote in the required poll.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia 's Telma TV on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people are planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agree to vote in favour.
More than 50 percent votes are required for the vote to be successful.
If the vote fails, the policy of the Western Government formed in May last year will suffer its first serious blow.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forces the whole Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling defended well against Brighton in Manchester City 's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City, England on Saturday.
Ironically, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was passed in midfield in the opening round.
As soon as he landed on the open field, he had three Brighton players defend him.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players.
He pushed a defending player before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, finding Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, Aguero used his left boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and the ball went out of his right side and into the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter, "Aguero has some problems with his feet that are bothering him".
We talked about his game for 55 minutes, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.
But, it was thanks to Stirling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League clash.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that game Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's field.
He took the ball beautifully out of Leroy Sen's left.
Sen made a few touches before sending Sterling away with a good game.
Just before the game slipped by the hand, the Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League group play will now take place from Hoffenheim at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhine Necker Arena in Sinsim, Germany.
The Shakers want to beat him by playing against the Rockies.
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals was over, there was no great reason to push for another start.
But the ever-competitive Scaggs are hoping to score big against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the playoffs are still a possibility for the Rockies, who have won the game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to capture the Division I title.
"Even if we're not playing very well, we can at least play knowing that the atmosphere of Denver with the crowd and the other team will be for probably the highest level game I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play that game?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but there are rumours that Schäzer could be involved in such a situation.
Schäzer, playing for his 34th start, risked the bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his normal on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander went 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court in the letter to Brett Kavanaugh.
"All the work we have done will be on the line in November.
We are now just five weeks away from the most important choice of our lives.
He said, "This is a big election - I am not involved, but I am involved because I am fighting for all the great candidates.
Trump added, "You can look at this very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
Moreover, they are trying to seize power by other necessary means, which you know are pointless and useless.
To get power and control, they don 't care who is unhappy, who is deserving, they just want power and control here, but we will not let that happen.
The Democrats' campaign is "opposition and obstruction", he said.
"Besides, you can see what has happened in the last four days, you have seen the anger of the Democrats and also seen how mean and bad they are.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, who was applauded by the audience in a loud manner.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for the thing -- whose body language was really bad -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Working is no longer broad church.
It is not tolerable for those who speak from their own heart.
When the activists who were promoting my local party voted for me, it was a big surprise to me.
After all, I am the newest of the Labour MPs who have been greatly diminished - we cannot speak our minds.
It happened here with my colleague John Ryan, because he too had spoken out for antisocialism.
In my case, Censor Motion condemned me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
There were similar problems in Europe, systematically, on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on which Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
"We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive", said a statement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday.
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I have seen most of the Friday night GC meetings here exactly the same.
Sadly, many meetings today are not agreed upon and or promised that the politics of "kind and gentle people" are actually forgotten, and this is where it happened.
It is obvious that in the Labour Party, if there are different views, they are not tolerated and each opinion is decided on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started right after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues who I had thought had the same political views as me started expecting me to back down and take positions I could never agree with - whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak out for the people - and it really doesn't matter what I say - I get a lot of bad language on social media, sharp comments, condemnation of centre politics and being told I'm not worthy of the Labour Party.
Besides, it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are politically related.
I know how business works and I am devoted to colleagues who are always facing sexual or racial abuse, but don't shy away from speaking out.
There are many frustrating aspects to the political era of today, one of which is how to normalize levels of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that it was important for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer broad churches and every "no - confidence" motion or change in the party 's selection rules has been reduced to a very small amount.
Over the last two years, I've had many people advise me and urge me to keep quiet, not to talk too much, and then I'll be "proved right".
But, I did not come to politics for this.
32 years ago, when I was a student working in the labor movement, I was encouraged to protest the Thatcher government, told to leave my large classroom completely, and demanded better public services for those who needed them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden any of my politics, including the politics of the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy post and any areas of disagreement about my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that hurts our homes, businesses and public services, I do not see the need to waste my time and energy in showing my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But I actually have a message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my supporters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no unnecessary risks or political campaigns will interfere with my work, I am only interested in what is in your best interest.

Iron 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Iron reach the top
Two late attempts may have affected the final outcome to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ayr Tennant deserved to win this most entertaining match of the Premiership.
Now they are only top of the table with ten unbeaten sides.
In the end, their defense was excellent, they found the best opportunities they could, which led to the home team being promoted and giving coach Peter Murchy a chance to be happy.
He said, "We've tested our game thoroughly and we're still undefeated, so I'm happy".
Robin Christie of Melrose explained: "It goes to the Irish, who made the most of their opportunity".
Grant Anderson's 14th minute effort forced Frazier Climo to come forward, but the Warriors gave Scotland 's Rory Hughes a yellow card for the game, which allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggen to redeem the very difficult effort.
With the help of a penalty just before half-time, Climo increased the Eyre, scored and then tried to tie the match 17-5 for Eyre at half-time.
But Melrose improved in the second half and Baggott converted Patrick Anderson's effort into a goal, which reduced Levy by five points.
After that, Ruriddich Knott suffered a serious injury which had to stop the game for a long time, he was stretched, then after the start of the game, Ayer went ahead and tried through Stafford McDowall which Climo converted into a goal.
At the time, Ayr's team captain Blair MacPherson had received a yellow card, and then due to too much pressure at the end of the game, the Melrose gave an attempt to extra man Bruce Colvin who failed to cash it.
However, the hosts were left behind and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card due to a penalty line-out from a clinch of the ball, McPherson pushed Eyre forward from behind and scored a touchdown.
After Kelly Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the home side's fifth attempt, Climo turned it into a goal, as he could have done at the restart of the game.
The game stars are still looking for new careers in the restaurant industry.
Game star Ford Kieran is still looking for ways to get into the hospitality industry, having been chosen to be a director of a licensed restaurant company a while back.
The 56-year-old is associated with the popular BBC show Jarvis, writing and acting alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have indicated that the upcoming ninth series will be their last in the show's world, and it seems that they are planning what Kearnen will do after Craigslist.
According to the official record list, he is a director of Edriftmorne Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source hinted that Cairnann was looking to join an "old restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We have the right to the sea': Land-constrained Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Military - naval personnel are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz on a massive scale.
Oceanic blue flags are being waved over government buildings.
The naval base, which stretches from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, has a slogan: "We have the right to the sea".
It is our duty to recover it.
Coastal Bolivia, which lost to Chile in a terrible land dispute in the 19th century, is still desperate to regain its land - it wants to once again fly its flag in the Pacific Ocean.
They now hope to regain their land from Bolivia decades ago, as it awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"There is a lot of enthusiasm in Bolivia now", said Roberto Calajilla, a Bolivian diplomat, "there is a sense of unity and peace, and the hope of the people here is that there will be a positive outcome".
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's grand verdict on the big screens across the country, hoping that the ruling from the Hague court will be in favor of Bolivia - which has been negotiating for decades - forcing Chile to negotiate the return of Bolivian land at sea.
Bolivia's best-ever president Evo Morales - who faces a controversial re-election bid next year - also expressed his optimism in Monday's ruling.
Last August, he said, "We are very close to getting the Pacific Ocean back.
But some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's interest - and if it is, there will be many conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to reward the Chilean province, and has decided not to determine the possible outcome of the talks.
Paz Zret, a Chilean expert at the International Court of Justice, said the ICJ decision comes six months after the final talks, which indicated that the case was not complicated.
Moreover, unlike Bolivia's conditions, it has been looking like for the past four years that it may return to its old state.
The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia, Jarrett said.
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement had destroyed Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on certain terms, but this time it will be very difficult to negotiate after the decision.
Since 1962, ambassadors of both countries have not been in each other's country.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually hasty.
He said that Monday would be a great opportunity for Bolivia to open new paths with Chile and to "end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit".
Calazilla has denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was politicising the maritime issue.
He said, "Bolivia will never back down from its right to access the Pacific Ocean".
A decision is an opportunity to know what we should have done in the past.
North Korea has said that nuclear testing will not stop until it has confidence in the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb until it trusts Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called upon the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore Summit between the leaders of the other countries.
He commented that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo feels he is about to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korea's Kim Jong - un made promises in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that would see the North give up on sanctions and US objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington is wary of consenting to a significant disarmament campaign already underway without Pyongyang's announcement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But it is entirely doubtful that Pyongyang is serious about ending nuclear bomb inspections because it does not want to jeopardize the country 's security.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit, which is a joint initiative between Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show has unveiled a new range of designer headwear for your nearby high street.
If you need to expand your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, you don't have to wait much longer.
Both Valentino and Tom Brown have created a series of high-end headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway, which was featured at the famous Paris Fashion Week.
The best useful hats are made to survive this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to showcase in the show.
The best hats Valentino made were quite large, decorated with a wide, winglike brim hanging from the model's head.
The second accessory, with a much larger side, included water-lemon hats, wizard hats, and pineapple hats made in bezel designs - but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Tom Brown also showed special-designed masks - and they can only be worn in time for Halloween.
People were surprised by the many colorful masks and more Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creation saw all sorts of scuba diving accessories including snowbells and goggles, while the second creation saw a design with a melting ice cream cone.
Besides, if you've seen more big fashion - you're in luck.
Fashion enthusiasts are predicting that this great collection could soon be in the best stores in your area.
The oversized hat will be available with a Bombay design heel, the two-foot wide brim straw hat will be available for everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The back of the highly effective hat was labeled cult which looked quite beautiful, with a second creation posted on social media alongside a catwalk - showing the model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Burnt Orange Rafia Bag, trimmed with Rafia fringing and fitted with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquimus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told FEMEL: 'I hope that the big hats and beach bags for the upcoming summer season will be in stores soon - because designers have been so impressed that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.'
JN: Language skills are essential for foreigners.
Scotland's private schools have a track record of excellent education, and since 2018 have continued to deliver excellent test results, strengthening individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland are associated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), under whose leadership these schools are striving to provide the best possible service to their pupils and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places benefiting citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can create and implement school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue to be chosen as popular and desirable subject options in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, you become the best for him.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will be very pleasing to his heart.
When we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries, we feel we can rely more on English.
In the recent results of this year's examination, we can see that languages with the highest pass rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
Of these, 68 per cent are students who have achieved the highest grade A in foreign languages.
Data collected by the 74 member schools of SCIS shows that 72 per cent of pupils achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of pupils achieved the highest grade A in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are collaborating in foreign languages to give children and young people the skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now being included in the curriculum of private schools as an optional subject and in other things like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled to recruit staff for vacant positions, with 17 per cent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative to have more and more language skills to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential to work anywhere in the world because of the more potential job opportunities that require language.
Whatever career choices people make, if they have learned a second language, such skills will surely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreigners, being a multilingual person will automatically put you ahead of the competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 UK adults participated in a YouGov survey, which found that 75 percent could not speak a foreign language adequately and only 15 percent spoke French, the only language to reach the double-digit percentage.
That is why it is necessary to invest in language teaching today.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find the right employment.
The languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different.
There are also many schools that will focus more on classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that have a 2020 perspective and are considered most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what language your child is interested in learning, he will always be able to choose that language in private schools and will also find teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need to succeed so they can move forward in the future.
The fact that language learning in the country is very important for the future cannot be ruled out for the global business environment, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should be recognized as truly international communication skills.
The choice of choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland will continue to be given by private schools.
It must be done well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron started Sunday in San Diego as part of the Lakers.
Now the waiting of LeBron James fans is about to end as he is about to play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers very soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been selected as the preseason opener for Sunday's game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But, how many minutes they will play is yet to be decided.
The Lakers have announced via their official website that they will play for at least one minute and 48 minutes at most.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don 't need to prepare for the pre - season game.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump held a large campaign rally tonight.
Trump has scheduled five more rallies next week, including in Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other favorable locations.
With a stay on the vote set in his election for the vacant Supreme Court appointment, Trump aims to seek support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans risk being out of Congress' control by the time of the vote count in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The time for Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is set for 7 pm ET tonight on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via YouTube live stream.
Trump may deliver a speech at this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose sex crime charges have held up a much anticipated Senate confirmation vote for a week during the FIT investigation.
But the main goal of this tense moment of rallies is to help Republicans cope with the November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump thus stated during the campaign, "The goal of these five rallies next week is to infuse the spirit of volunteers and supporters as a Republican effort to protect and increase their blocked majority in the Senate and House of Representatives".
According to Reuters, the spokesman who was removed from Trump's campaign said that control of Congress has become so important to his agenda that the president will only visit states where our campaign season will be very busy.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally at Wheeling's Wesbanko Arena could bring the attention of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh media.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to try to help out the candidate Patrick Morris, who is lagging behind in the West Virginia Republican Senate poll.
According to Reuters, West Virginia University political scientist Simon Heather said, "If the president is trying to get Morris to lead the election, it's not a good sign for him".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed willingness to compete to maintain the top spot in the Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will give the results of what is going to happen in this Ryder Cup.
The cycle of time is a completely new concept for players, but when which player will come out on top and which player to trust, it cannot be predicted in competitions like this.
So, what do they say about this momentum now?
As we walked through the day, Jordan Speeth said, "They had a six - point lead, now down to four, so I think we need to increase our speed a little bit.
Of course, Europe gained the advantage and took the lead by four points to 12 in the game.
According to Spirit, the Americans feel they have few, many chances left and have a lot to encourage, not only from Spirit's form but also from Justin Thomas's form, who played together all day and both scored three points out of four from their play.
The Spirit is deadly to everyone from the T to the Green and is the best in the game.
The crowd cheered and applauded as his game progressed, as he and Thomas went two more points down after two, making the crucial putt to complete four all-squares.
It was his put that got his team to 15th position with the same scream, sort of telling you that you don't consider the American team out of it.
"You really just have to play well and remember that the victory is yours.
That is what all the players who have been out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
Only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, are making history in the Ryder Cup.
The European, differently styled but better couple scored four points out of four and are in the lead.
Saturday afternoon was "Mollywood" was the only couple who did not shoot a bogie, but they stayed away from the bogie on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning until before 9 am.
On Sunday, the run and the way he scored that run in this overwhelming crowd and this overwhelming crowd was like he was a batting player, and no player who could turn a potential European team win into a loss seemed to have the sunset of Le Golf National earlier than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is good that both are on different holes in different ways.
However, the dignity of the European has been discussed for a long time.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball hero Sergio Garcia, at the time their pair was created with Alex Noreen.
The Spaniard and Swede, who had never been able to get here before, made a hole in front of nine dogs in a bogie and two doubles.
However, on Sunday there was no one present to help you get to your hole.
The Forball and the Forsum were great because the interaction between the pairs was great, they advised that they didn 't need to seek advice and they are well acquainted with how to change the strategy.
Europe as a team played very well and took a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the ability to compete in a way that, especially on the Stateside, is questionable.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will take advantage of the 10 - 6 lead in the United States on Saturday in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The top pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over struggling Tiger Woods with two wins to push their match well ahead of Le Golf National by four points.
To avenge his trophy defeat two years ago at Hazeltine, Thomas Bjorn's European side dominated the morning football due to the American side's misfire, giving him a 3 - 1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the foursome, winning two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
To hold on to the trophy win, Jim Furyk's side need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari started off with "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, they are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their opening four matches.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they again beat top players Woods and American rookie Bryson Deschambou by 5 and 4 points, performing even better than before.
Woods, who held his own by two games on Saturday, had his best showing, but now has 19 losses in his 29 games in foosball and foursome and seven in roe.
The remaining morning foursome, Justin Rose, with his partner Henrik Stenson, returned to the foursome and beat world number one and three Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopeka 2 - 1.
However, Europe had no breakthrough on the Pleasant, Breezy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
He won the Fourball by 2-1 over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter and sent Pauls and Rory McIlroy back 4-3 on the opening two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has come back from a single - leg draw with four points, although the kind of need for Furyk's side kept everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, after two days of second best, the counterattack on Sunday is going to be as different as their old game.
North Korea said that saying 'no way' would only disarm one side that cannot be trusted.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the UN had continued sanctions that were based on its mistrust of the United States and showed no way for the country to stop inspecting the nuclear bomb on its own in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's Annual General Assembly that last year North Korea had tried several ways that were "important ways of goodwill", such as stopping nuclear bomb and missile tests, demolishing a nuclear bomb test site, and promising not to pursue nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any response from the US for this", he said.
"Without any reliance on the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and there is no way that we can initiate unilateral disarmament in such situations".
While Ri reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea were about Washington's "phased" approach to disarmament, under which gradually North Korea would benefit, his statement made it clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left to one side alone, as Pyongyang has done before.
At the first summit between the sitting U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at which Kim pledged to work toward "the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US has first insisted on disarmament and increased the pressure level of sanctions to forcefully achieve its objective, and at the same time, it has objected to "declaring the end of the war", Ri said.
"Bonding can bend us, such a belief is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the problem is that the continuous restrictions are further eroding our confidence.
Ri did not discuss plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, saying the U.S. leader had spoken of the strengths of the United Nations last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party to this disarmament problem is South Korea and not the U.S., then the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula will not be part of such a standoff".
Still, Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech to the U.N. National Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets after the so-called "evil president" Trump on the "Rocket Man" suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, had praised Kim's courage in pushing for disarmament but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for this, "It doesn 't matter if it takes two years, three years or five years".
China and Russia are arguing that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council that: "The Security Council's sanctions should remain in place until we realize without fail that we are conducting complete, final and verified disarmament".
The Security Council unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
He returned from Pyongyang in July and said the work had progressed, only to be condemned by North Korea within hours for "gangster-like demands".
At the Moon Summit this month, North Korea vowed to destroy the missile site and, if the United States takes appropriate action, to destroy the nuclear complex.
He said that Kim had promised him "reasonable measures", he was seeking security guarantees that Trump would make a resolution in Singapore and move toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students are training for a job with enough rest.
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get the most out of their time competing in the growing macho culture for study through caffeine-fueled "all-nights".
The teacher who teaches students at the world's number one university often has no choice when it comes to such simple things as what to do to relax himself.
Charles Kazisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
The idea of starting this course came to him after he talked about the effects of sleep deprivation during teaching.
He told The Telegraph, 'A girl came to me at the end of the year and she said, 'Why do I always say I have to go to the next class next year?'
He said that no one had told him about the importance of sleep - which shocked me.
The first course of this year will teach students how good sleep habits are important in studying and athletic performance, and will also improve their overall health.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said students don't get enough sleep every week, which is why the university decided to launch the course.
The course, which lasts for hours, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books to explain what effect caffeine and light have and what effect sleep deprivation has on athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep time in the routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately", said Professor Zeissler.
But we believe that they should be informed - just as they are informed about the health effects of smoking.
He said that while the culture of pride in 'all night reading' still exists, modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means that they have to sleep less which has become a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough and good sleep is like a secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - it also prevents the impact on weight because lack of sleep keeps their brain thinking about hunger which makes them feel hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jessler build the course, having completed his last year of class at Harvard during the previous year.
He said that the course made him aware and motivated him to take the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that it will be considered mandatory for all postgraduate students to complete this course before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Jesler suggested that students should consider setting alarms before bedtime, decide when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights, which can cause them to exhibit excessive circadian rhythms and sleep problems.
Livingston's 1-0 against Rangers: Menga scored against Gerard
Rangers struggled in another match due to Dolly Menga's strike, putting the blame for Livingston's 1-0 win on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
The Ibro side were looking for their first win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side pushed Gerard as manager for a second loss in 18 games to knock out Landbrooks Premiership leaders Hurts by eight points.
Menga strikes for seven minutes before half time and after that the Rangers line-up shorts never get a chance to even the game.
However, Rangers have now dropped down to sixth place in the standings, Livingston has moved up to third and is only behind Hibernian due to goal difference.
Furthermore, the game could be even more troublesome for the Rangers since the head wound of lineman Calum Spence has been treated since the object was apparently thrown to the other end.
Eight changes to Gerard's side saw the previous year's Ayr qualify for the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Livie 11 that took a point from Hertz last week and the way he drilled well made the opposing team troubled at every turn.
Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga first sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal in the late - off, he should have had only two minutes, but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity.
When Keegan Jacobs in the deep kicked, the kick went to captain Craig Hulket, but his defensive partner in the back post, Alan Lithgow, could only stab wide.
The Rangers were in control, but in the final third they had more confidence in the hope than in their own game.
Of course Alfredo Morelos felt he should have taken a penalty at the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on target in the first-half, but former Ibero goalkeeper Liam Kelly struggled with strikes from Lasana Colibri's header and Twe OV Azaria.
Although the opener could have gone against Livy 's run of the game in the 34th minute, no one can deny that he alone is entitled to this graft.
Even after this, the best player in the Rangers Deep could not beat Jacob.
When Deacon Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield showed no interest, Scott Robinson kept Menga quiet to pick for a simple finish.
When Gerard swapped Colibell for Ryan Kent and switched to make an immediate impact as he was slotted by the winger at Morelos, he had taken a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line with a good run.
But Livingstone showed the visitor the kind of game they could really enjoy, they swept the long ball with Lithgo and Hulket after the long ball.
Holt's side could have increased their lead in the final stage, but McGregor stopped Jacobs from a good stud up before Lithgow made a wide from the corner.
The Rangers called in alternate Glenn Middleton, who claimed another late for a penalty as he had gotten into trouble with Jacobs, but Thompson did not let him succeed again.
Elmanak: The inventor of the geyser counter
Now a page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and beyond... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiser was born in Germany.
Geiser invented a device for detecting and measuring radioactivity which later became known as the Geiser counter.
Geyser counter is a mainstay of science, it has become a mainstay of pop culture, and, in 1950, a film "Bells of Coronado" was made on it, starring for the first time scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
Once you turn on these earphones, you can definitely hear the effects of the atoms hidden in the minerals because of the radioactivity".
Evans: "Tell me, it's definitely popping up right now!"
"Hans" Geiser died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But his name has survived because of his invention.
A new cancer vaccine can detect defective cells of the immune system.
A new cancer vaccine can detect and kill defective immune system cells.
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify damaged cells during treatment.
This method can be used to extract and replace the immune cells of a patient in a laboratory.
Then, they can be screened for a protein common to many cancers and then removed and re-implanted.
A trial for the vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman was given this vaccine, which looked at her immune system's damaged cells, and then found that her ovarian cancer, which had been present for over 18 months, was gone.
This method can take a patient's immune cells in the lab and modify them to "look" for a common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then remove the cells and replant them.
"Our results suggest that this vaccine is very promising", said Professor J. Berzowski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Berzowski said that HER2 causes "many types of cancer to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
Removing immune cells from patients and instructing them to detect cancerous cells is useful in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
After her SNL appearance, Kanye West on MAGA Hat condemned Trump's long-standing controversial speech.
It didn't work.
After Kanye West's excellent performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that his government will also form in 2020, he condemned in the studio during Saturday Night Live.
After her performance of her third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great cap, she lashed out against the Democrat and reiterated her support for Trump.
He said, "So, I talk to white people a lot, and they say, 'What makes you like Trump, is he racist?'
Still, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago.
SNL kicked off the show with a skit by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star poked fun at Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judiciary Committee is already investigating sexual assault claims made against him by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing like this was shown, with footage of West's condemnation being uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It was not revealed whether Rock was trying to make West laugh with the post because of the post.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that she was threatened to go backstage with her headwear.
"He threatened me backstage.
He said, 'You don't go in there wearing that hat.'
They threatened me!
He also said that he was stuck in the wrong place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "You want to see the wrong place?" Also, he said, "They're going to make a play for my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Love is love.
In his comments he mentioned the audience at least twice and the SNL cast felt embarrassed, with a separate report telling the publication: "The whole studio went completely silent".
West was called in due to a delay in arrival of singer Ariana Grande, who died a few days ago, the former boyfriend of Ariana Grande, rapper Mac Miller.
West surprised many viewers with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Periyar Bottle.
West met again with Candace Turner, head of the Conservative Group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: Thank you for speaking up for the people".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "what she said and what is absolutely amazing".
"But I did not choose someone who would profit (by buying my music or clothes or supporting my art) by promoting what I believe to be a false image of my community or misrepresenting my community.
He is free.
That is why we exist", he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, as well, adding that he was just "going to be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, but earlier did Didi and Puffy, whose old name was respectively Puff Didi and P Didi.
Along with him, the rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly known as Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince also changed his name to Ankit and after that the artist was already known as Prince.
A knife attack attempted at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder, allegedly stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackmore.
The defence is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington has questioned the toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is best known for his swordplaying role as John Snow in HBO's Violent Medieval Fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that many young boys are often inspired by such roles on screen and feel that it is necessary to do such a hard job to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she was sensing 'something was wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, who she believes feels 'quite determined' to talk about the problem.
He said, 'I personally feel quite strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong about masculinity?
Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they're going to have to deal with the problems that are on the screen?
Kit feels that television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, he credits its overly masculine character.
He added: 'What happens and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the street, young boys are beginning to believe that they must do certain things to be a man?
I think it's really become one of the big questions of our time: How can we change this?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men's ideas.'
In an interview, he also admitted that when Game of Thrones returns at the end of next summer, he will not be participating in any of its prequels or sequels, and that he has 'made a number of programmes involving battlefields and horse riding'.
Starting in November, Kit will be working on the new series of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is a bandit.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones was meeting his wife Rose.
"I found my life partner through the show", she said, "so I believe that the show has given me my future family and my life has moved on from there".
Rose plays Yugrit, the girlfriend of Kit's character John Snow in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, China has seen a 14% increase in new cases.
China has announced a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS cases in the country.
Health officials have reported that more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
Given recent changes, most new cases are being attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV has been spreading rapidly in parts of China due to infectious blood infections.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials reported that the number of people infected with HIV through this medium had dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission through sex by the LGBT community in China is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but there is reportedly a lot of discrimination against people in the LGBT community.
Studies have estimated that because of the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Because of the many infections of the disease, there is insufficient protection in these relationships regarding sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve the problem by promising everyone access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Waters denied that her staff had leaked GOP Senator's data, calling it a 'dangerous lie' and a 'conspiracy method'.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters called the allegations unfortunate on Saturday, saying one of her employees had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Lawmaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being investigated by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
Waters tweeted, "Lies, lies and too much hate".
Reportedly, the information provided included the home addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and two Senators from Utah, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was seen online Thursday posted by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill, as a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was underway.
The leak of certain information on three senators has raised questions about Kavanaugh.
Hill says that conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState, which tracked IP addresses that identify the source of the post, were told that the source was linked to Waters' office and that an employee of Waters had released the information.
"This allegation is completely unfounded, false and utterly false", Waters said.
"No one of my employees - whose identity, personal information and safety are being compromised because of these false and false allegations - was in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This charge is baseless, completely false and utterly false.
Waters soon posted online to clear up criticism, including from the former White House press secretary.
Fletcher wrote, "The reason for this rejection is anger.
"It shows that his temperament is not what a Congressman should be.
When someone is accused, they should not do it in anger.
They should not become rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the accusation.
They should be calm and patient.
It seemed that Fletcher was comparing Waters' response to the condemnation of Democrats of Justice Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is seeking to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
He tweeted, "If this is true, it is a big deal.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement units to these claims of fraud.
"We're going to make sure that the perpetrators are brought to justice, and that they are held legally accountable for all the things they've done that are very bad and dangerous to any and all of my employees", he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson's spy act was not considered very powerful
The importance of Brexit in any new film from a British perspective is still traditionally seen and seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action - comedy spoof franchise that began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Will we self - satire on the subject of how we certainly find it nonsense to talk about the nation 's new export opportunity?
The unfit, pop-minded, rubber-faced Johnny English has his license to recreate things with bare feet - much more famous than anything else by name alone - as a comic creation for the wider world where non-English speakers live.
He is certainly the Daft Secret Agent who managed to show off Mr. Bean's dash clusters a bit despite his bizarre pretence in smooth glamour and a drop for the chap who contributed the single note to the Fire theme tune's charity at the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony.
He is basically a traveller and an international man of mystery Atkinson whose role in Barclaycard TV commercials was forgotten except for the chaos of the wake.
There are only one or two good scenes in this new JE outing.
I liked Johnny English, which showed me climbing into a helicopter in a medieval suit with armor and wrapping the rotor blade around my helmet.
It's a gift for Atkinson to do physical comedy on screen, but the laughter was very limited and the weird half-assed look, especially when "great" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible present themselves as a component of comedy with complete confidence.
Laughter comes as if comedy were not for adults but for children, and the strange misunderstandings of Johnny English are not at all tolerable to me, and I preferred Bean in Atkinson's silent films.
The most relevant thing is that Great Britain is in a serious crisis right now.
The most secretive network of the UK's spy agencies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, who identified all the UK's operational agents on the network, which could have affected the agent's work - a tragic event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and rather troubled Prime Minister, who is already grappling with many political and unpopularity problems: Emma Thompson could play this quasi-Teresa-maker character well, but the script is not strong enough to work on this script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every working spy had a deal, he would have to bring in someone who had retired.
So it meant that Johnny English had to fight himself, now a schoolmaster at some posh institute, but working off the record on what an undercover operative should be: some good comic books, plus, being taught English by a detective at a rock-type academy school.
English has been sent back to the Emergency Whitehouse for briefing and Ben Miller's reprise is paired with his rather old-fashioned, sore-ass sidekick Boff.
Now Boff is married, he is trying to become a submarine commander, his role is that of Jolly - Hockey - Sticks in which Vicky Pepperdine is not able to get his feet wet.
So, in His Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin find some very big mistakes when they face the beautiful and famous Ofelia Bulletova of Olga Kruelenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister finds himself in danger of being approached by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to have the solution to Britain's computer crises: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bogue begin their odyssey of the feudal high-junkies: working as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle through Volta's expensive boat; and English activates the complete chaos when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to access the interior of Volta's home.
The film is certainly filmed everywhere for that last sequence, but it is still neat and entertaining, there is a lot of fun for children throughout the film.
It 's a middle class thing.
Also, as I have seen in other Johnny English films, in this film I could not understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that really suits his talent.
Labour has denied that it plans to limit working hours to four days a week for the British people, but that it will pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a democratic plan whereby British residents will work only four days a week - but will get paid on a five-day basis.
The party reportedly wants the company owner to give workers a share of the savings made through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, so that they can get an extra day off.
This will give the employee three days off a week - but they will still be able to get the same pay.
Sources say that such an idea will be 'corrected' with the party's economic agenda and is planned to benefit the country's workers.
The four-day shift is being promoted by the Trades Union Congress to enable workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party staffer told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but it is expected to involve a four-day work week, which is in line with the party's overall industrial strategy as well as the party's vision of rebalancing the economy in favour of workers.'
While the Green Party pledged a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea.
However, this desire is not fully supported by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to get power back from the 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' in utility firms.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their full stake back as the Labour government can 'cut' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees on company boards and to hand over 10% equity of private sector firms to employees, who can receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Cavana could change their minds
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and it raises questions as to whether the bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if there was any possibility that the FBI might find something that would prompt them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more white than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think so, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said that on the way to the hearing I spoke to Judge Kavanagh.
After that, when the allegation came out, I called them, asked, 'Did you do this?'
They were certain, firmly resolved, clear".
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be a stone's throw away.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would have required an explosive charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham continued, quoting Christine Blasey Ford.
"And he could not confirm what they called him.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any change".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert with many of the most influential stars performing, and just as influential is its mission: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the program to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Starting in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers will have to complete "actions" in a variety of ways, such as volunteering, emailing, calling a world leader, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal in the last 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people through free concerts the right way to get people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" - making people feel like they're really making a difference by signing online petitions or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing efforts toward various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or fund-raising.
The group estimates that the Safe Fund has directly impacted around 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers, which pledged to "help children develop to their full potential" by pledging $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
During a live concert in London in April 2018, the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman told the crowd, "With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history".
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to a frequently asked question on their website, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the few performers at this year's event in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy for "blockade" to disrupt Russian energy exports: Home Secretary
Cited by the Washington Examiner, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could resort to the US Navy "if necessary" to block Russian energy in US markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke accused Russia's work in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - of being a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
He reportedly said that "the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that I think they want to broker energy, as they have done in the southern regions of Europe, in Eastern Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that sea lanes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in America.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were effectively identical.
Referring to Russia as a "one-way potato" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said, "The economic alternative in the case of Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage of and replace fuel".
Statements are coming that the Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unfair" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers".
The American position was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am in great trouble when a big state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kemff, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" a presidential race after the midterm elections.
During the Town Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes having a woman at the top".
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
"They are taking this county in the wrong direction", Warren said, assessing President Donald Trump during the town hall.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy", he said.
Warren has been vocal in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need to have an FBI check before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents do not think they should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, eighty - eight percent of Massachusetts "potential" voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty - two per cent supported such a contest.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting a potential entry into the race and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names being discussed for potential run-offs through 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin, referring to Palin's PTSD at the rally of Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Pauline spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the Army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in a domestic violence incident.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, she told the audience, "Because of what my own son is going through, what he's feeling after coming back, I sympathize with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and I know the wounds our soldiers come back with".
Pauline called his imprisonment "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They come back with a little change, they come back tough, they come back wondering if this honor is for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military have sacrificed for the country".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence and carrying a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang-running or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed a Justice-friendly briefing in Washington on Friday in support of a refugee challenging the policy.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons" abused her, but US authorities rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Government attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, which produce large numbers of applicants for U.S. asylum.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Carl Reisin, Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims should be adjudicated on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstruction violates that principle", Justice Mitra said.
The attorney further argued in the brief that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, "Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group".
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
The search for survivors is intensifying as the death toll doubles
For the survivors, the situation was extremely critical.
"It feels very stressful", said 35-year-old mother Reisa Kusuma, comforting a child with a fever at the evacuation center in the city of Taksimalu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their abandoned houses, picking up the flooded goods, trying to save whatever they could find.
The 7.5 magnitude quake hit hundreds of people and flooded hospitals.
Some of the injured, including Dwee Harris, who was suffering from broken backs and shoulders, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the continuous strong earthquake shaking.
Tears filled his eyes as he felt the tremors of the earthquake in his fifth - floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed in the ruins of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' through 'propaganda ads'
A week after a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper by the official Chinese newspaper, citing the mutual benefits of US - Chinese trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections - referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections was a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen them impose tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say that earlier in the trade war, China's retaliatory tariffs were designed to slam exporters in states like Iowa, which had backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstedt wrote in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is "now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent press".
"In its propaganda, by offering paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and free journalism", Branstedt wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in the strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here at the roadside newsstand in Beijing, you will find limited dissatisfied voices and no accurate reflection of the conflicting opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's worrying economic curve", he wrote.
He said that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China avoided the offer to publish his article with a pretext", although he did not name the newspaper.
With Kavanaugh's defeat, Republicans are isolating women voters ahead of the midterm elections, analysts warn
As top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, the analyst warns that they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
There is a lot of sentiment around this, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
There is no going back on those things", Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Rehr said he doubted that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women cannot forget what happened yesterday - neither the day after tomorrow nor in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters demonstrating in the Senate lobby chanted "November is coming!", Mick reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to fall off the charts", said Stu Rothenberg, a non-political analyst, telling the news site.
"People are saying it is already overwhelming; it is true.
But it can be more, especially among suburban female voters and young voters aged 18 to 29, who don't often vote when they don't like the president".
Even before the public testimony, detailing Ford's allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said that there was a possibility of opposition if Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
"It has become a confusing mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about committee votes or the final vote or the bench seating of Cavana, it's also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they've treated them", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democrat election aid organization, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe in the light of the testimony of Ford and Cavanagh, most of whom appeared to favor Cavanagh.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or potentially believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or potentially believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt that Kavanagh may or may not have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as, at least, another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh beat him while he was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee displayed his genitals when he attended a party while attending Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is to achieve "global dominance".
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can make them available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete transformation where all their business models will be completely wiped out overnight.
"We are not asking them for permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even at the time of launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vaughan: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric is celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrated 100 years in his home town.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the attack on Belenglish and Lehocort on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won Britain 's highest military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his ships at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vaughan, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the statue was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion at the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in the midst of a very thick fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield".
Later he marched towards the firing line and with "great valour" led the military line and crushed three detachments before taking up the field - gun alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said that his grandfather's achievements were "something I know I can never equal, but we are proud of".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughan also performed the Mass after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added that "the support being given by many people is demonstrating the heroism of a real hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you stayed up all night to watch the thrilling Bellator 206 but missed the main program.
The San Jose bill had 13 matches, including six on the main card and was being shown live all night on U.K. Channel 5.
At 6am, as Geagard Moussaci and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, audiences in the UK were stunned by the coverage turning into Peppa Pig.
Some were extremely disappointed, especially after staying up late for the competition.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, said, "It was not appropriate for the content to be aired at 6 a.m. according to government regulations, so they had to switch to children's programming".
"Peppa the Pig", he said.
Scott Coker, president of the Bellator Company, said they were going to work on their scheduling to include the UK audience in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we might be able to find a solution", Coker said.
"But then it will be six o 'clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this change happened, there was a lot of text flowing and not all of it was compatible.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was some technical glitch.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it will not happen next time.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six - as we normally do - and when we tried to deliver something more to the fans, it got a little too much.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daly felt 'deficient' when it came to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he was driven by his sexuality to feel inferior to everyone - but that it inspired him to succeed.
Daly, 24, said that he didn't realize until he got to high school that "everyone is not like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc presented by Lauren LaVerne, she said she talks about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a father he cared less about winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
On Laverne's first show appearing as a socially awkward person, Daly said she felt "lower" in herself than everyone else because "liking boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
She said: "Even today, those feelings of being inferior, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me the strength and the strength to be able to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "special", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live out his life without any problems and he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that when she fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years her senior, but she said the age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find a peer who went through the ups and downs of such experiences at such a young age.
In June the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "entire outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father did not accept that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was if he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
He said, "I couldn't tell them you weren't going to stay in the front row, Dad".
He said, "When they could not breathe, I held their hands and held them until their breath stopped and they were dead, then I went and I believed that they were not invincible".
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this is what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of my home crowd at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", she said.
It also inspired his favourite first song - Proud by Heather Small - which was echoing with him during the preparations for the Olympics and which still makes his throat tingle.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mickelson out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his form to avoid it becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, Mickelson was sidelined by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Fourballs and Foursome.
Instead of being the center of attraction, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his days among the cheerleaders and working on improving the weaknesses of his playing style.
Never driving straight at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old was not an ideal fit for the Tite Le Golf National Course, where long-term inactives are regularly penalized for misses.
And where the course isn't so easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who started 12 singles matches four points down, start strong, Mickelson's match could prove to be quite important.
Furyk trusted his man, not that he could say anything else.
"He understood his role perfectly, patted me on the back and hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He is very confident.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn 't imagine him playing two matches.
I imagined more, but it worked out the way we thought we would have to move forward.
He wants to go out there like everybody else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This Ryder Cup may mark the end of a career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's responsive, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special", he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives more than just playing".
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a big lead in the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dan made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a 141⁄2-131⁄2-win, by the smallest margin, had just reached the finish line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, we just won", said Bernior, thinking, after watching the 2018 class lead Friday 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the people in that team that it is not over.
You will pay full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It is not over until you get the marks on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win this trophy and that's where we have to stay focused.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players in the world are on the other side".
Bjorn went on to describe how his players performed on the difficult golf course: "I could never outdo myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different tough time.
Tomorrow the individual demonstrations will come forward, and that is a different matter.
It's great to go out with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out there in person, your ability as a golfer is put to the test.
That is the message you need to send to the players that they should do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he has to do his best too".
Unlike Bjorn, opposite Jim Furyk would have been eager for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Before facing defeat by Europe for performing the "Miracle in Medina", as part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day reversals".
"I remember every word of it", he said when asked how captain Ben Cranshaw handled his players on their final day in 1999.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this speed is one-way, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We've set our line-up to our own standards and we've got people involved in ways that we felt, you know, we're trying to do something more miraculous tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the counterattack with Rory McClaroy in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the top half of the other European order.
"I grouped them in this order because I think it covers everyone", Bjorn said of his single selections.
The new German battleship is delayed again
New German Navy warships were supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the time-delayed Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, this will not happen until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesman quoted by the newspaper Die Zeit, the commissioning of the Rhineland - Papalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden - Württemberg - class warships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling issues after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden - Württemberg - class ships were ordered by the Navy back in 2007 to be brought in as replacements for the time - affected Bremen - class battleships.
It is understood that they will provide an array of powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies such as low radar, infrared and acoustic divisions.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, continued delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships - which could give Germany a chance to power projects abroad - will be timeless by the time they enter service, Di Zein noted.
The ill -fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Few people knew the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media cited several significant "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless when deployed on combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly significant because the Baden - Württemberg - class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half the manpower of the older Bremen - class battleships.
Furthermore, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 ton "Rhineland - Pfalz" is considered twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including crew training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have risen from an initial €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problem of new warships, which has become particularly important in the light of recent warnings, is holding back Germany 's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was indeed "running out of deployable ships".
The issue has become serious over time, as the old vessels were taken out of service, but no replacement vessels were made available, the official said.
He said none of the Baden-Württemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening in on the secret life of bats.
New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the natural landscape in their hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the normal and soprano pipistrels as well as the brown long-eared and Dobbenton bats inhabiting Inverway Gardens in Weston Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the property to track bat movements throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings reveals the frequency of the bat calls and what species are doing.
A natural habitat map and report will then be prepared for a detailed landscape - scale depiction of their behaviour.
Rob Dever, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural-habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of natural habitat management activities such as grassland creation and how to properly maintain woodlands for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and across the UK, the bat population has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect bird habitats and damage natural habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can certain chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to pinpoint defects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly survey, inspect and occasionally rescue bird nesting grounds.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the best place for him.
"Here in Thrive we have a great area for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so what we're doing here and at other properties will help us understand what they need to breed".
They stress the importance of bat screening before maintenance within properties as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of maternity maternity facilities could destroy 400 females and infants, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them or destroy their nesting grounds.
Elizabeth Farrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward for help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and we still don't know how many of our species are growing", he said.
Ronaldo denied the rape allegations while lawyers sued the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Derre Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after reporting the claims, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. " I was like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what is the way that is the way that is the way to do that is the way to do that is the way.
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but that is part of their job.
I am a happy person and all is well", the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations, according to Reuters, of what they have called "suspicious invalid reporting in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that players "will seek compensation for moral damages in amounts commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good person" who had been disappointed by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorka also claims that she went to the police and even took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to end the agreement because her harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer signed a €100 million deal with Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'regret forever' losing its car manufacturer
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the U.K. would "regret forever" if it lost its title as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnston near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event of no-deal Brexit, the delay in the border could affect jobs.
The Burnsstone plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"I believe that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Burntstone.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are related to supply chain risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts for made-to-order cars arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the U.K. and the European Union.
If the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, according to the industry, which could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relations with the EU is "purely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border".
"We want the best deal that I think is not only the right one to enjoy success at the moment, but the one that is necessary to get the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota but other manufacturers have given evidence that we should be able to fully continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, warned that the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually take jobs away.
Peter Sawaleris, who has worked at Burnston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are extremely concerned: "In my experience once these jobs are gone, they never come back afterwards.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House said Sunday that Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for "another week" as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's struggle continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and endangering Mueller's freedom, has been a hot topic in the Washington market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiring to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refuted the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House amidst the news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to remove Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Cavana and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weeklong FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "It is not set for this week, I can see that in view of all the other cases going on with the Supreme Court, it can be pushed forward another week.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated".
Some journalists have claimed that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to TV reporters' apathy for "gloriousness", although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are magnificent".
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
He said, "The president does more Q&A sessions than any other president", without citing evidence, he said, "We've seen those numbers".
The briefing will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States a direct question, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying very hard to do that and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the president of the United States, he's going to take the place of the press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President demonstrated why, by displaying a flawless and often unique presence before the press.
Health Secretary NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS, expressing the country's gratitude and wishing them well after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter to the EU less than six months after the UK withdrew.
The Scottish Government is committed to covering the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens already working in its underserved public services.
In her letter, Miss Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the UK and EU continued to engage in dialogue, moving towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also pushing ahead with its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this must have been a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
The EU, and colleagues from beyond, bring together valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we would love for you to stay".
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee Mike Organ reports that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came over to the edge and just fell there", Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Aberdrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"No details are available on the type/ extent of injury yet", Harris said, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before being out of the game, bringing his season total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged high stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a high stamp duty when they buy property in the U.K. which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes.
This move would neutralize the success of Corbyn 's campaign to attract young voters.
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on people who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes it will raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are being prepared to charge a higher stamp duty rate on property purchases in the U.K. - the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is being seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target the higher earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms not paying taxes in the U.K. with additional funds to boost the government's campaign to tackle the anomalous situation of the sleepwalkers.
Surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two houses started two years ago and rental purchases, may be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" as the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country is high.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people build their first home.
He accused large construction firms of driving up property prices by seizing land but not using it, and urged quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing shortage" in the message.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a fascinating series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and an end to "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more power to the councils for building new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for non-UK residents as it is for foreign-based companies to buy a home as it is for hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home is a distant one, and the lure of gold under unusual circumstances is very real".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
Scott, 42, is repeating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in League One, and which is three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father from a young age, and it's always been something that draws me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in managing the club".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Aloha Athletic boss says he felt no reluctance to follow established names at such a big club, who had previously rejected the initiative of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me now is whether I can get this club back into the Premier League".
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly comes into the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'd probably see myself as successful here if I could get the club there".
After spending 15 months as Dumbarton's assistant boss and on the Hearts coaching staff, Ross' management career has been just three years away.
He then helped Eloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and turned St Mirren from championship title winners to relegation the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
In the case of Aloa's inauguration, he said, "That was probably the real crossroads".
"I really believed that management was a better fit for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did the right thing, earned a decent living from it, and enjoyed some decent heights.
But playing can be difficult.
On a weekly basis you have to get a lot of things.
I still go through them in terms of the stress and pressure of the job but everything seems fine in terms of management.
I've always wanted to manage, and now that I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing I've ever done in my entire adult life".

The summer heat has boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but the fluctuations in restaurants were down 4.8 percent, the data showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles the data, said: "The consistent sunshine and England's expected World Cup participation mean that July followed a similar pattern to last June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except restaurants faced even more difficulties.
The decline in restaurant business of 1.8 percent in June worsened further in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol performed the strongest with higher likes than restaurants.
Food - operated pubs also suffered in the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for drinks.
For the month, drinks sales in all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent while food sales declined by 3 per cent. '
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The influence of weather and major social or sporting events forms the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales, especially due to ongoing cost pressures, would be painful.
The long summer weather could not have been a bad time for food operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed relief".
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, in July was 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slowdown in brand roll-out.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors industry sales for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups performing with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
Surveys show that one in five children - some under the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in "fake Instagram" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show to parents
One in five children - some younger than 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found a rapid increase in "fake Instagram" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clean "main" account to show parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who suddenly looked at her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found that a teenager was urging others to "rape me".
Research from independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of which were accepted for keeping private accounts.
"It's very disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them", said HMC president Mike Buchanan.
Elidhe Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elidhe Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most decorated track and field athletes and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to leverage their extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Elyth has a great deal of respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that bringing athletics to Scotland will be a huge benefit", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I'm looking forward to working as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, the American who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 games in Atlanta and who is now a regular BBC pundit, became unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago today I was in a shock.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was a terrible job, but I was able to recover completely, walk again and learn agility today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Comparisons of mothers to cows by breast pump advertisements have caused online opinion to diverge.
A breast pump company split opinion online by an advertisement that compared nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product dubbed "the world's first silent wearable breast bump", consumer tech company Elvie released a new hilarious music video-inspired commercial, giving new pump mothers the freedom to express themselves.
In a cow-grass barn, four real mothers dance to a song that includes some of the following lyrics: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't breasts, these are my boobs".
The chorus goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies".
However, the ad, which was posted on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it lightly portrays the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like us, they need to give birth to conceive and produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of giving birth", one wrote.
Elvie Breast Pump fits snugly into a nursing bra
Another comment: "Of course, it is painful for both mother and baby.
But why not use them as a promotional tool for breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to have their own babies?"
Another added: "What an irrelevant advertisement".
Others defended the ad, including one woman who said she found the song in the ad "funny".
"I think it 's a very good idea.
I would have had it too, if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little strange, but I saw it for what it is.
One wrote that it is a great product".
Another commented: "It's a funny ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not a promotional or definitive advertisement for the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they danced carefully pumping into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like they're a cow.
However, the Elvy pump is well concealed, has no wires or tubes and carefully fits directly into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their children and even go outside without pumping.
Anna Ballerin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvy pump is a revolutionary product, deserving of a blasted and spectacular launch.
By drawing parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges into the spotlight, demonstrating in a fun and relevant way the sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvy pump has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two who used the product was seen catwalking for designer Marta Jacquiebowski.
Hundreds of migrant children sneaked into a tent camp on the Texas border.
Trapped migrant children were spied on even when there was relatively no change in monthly border crossings, in part because the rigid curvature and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to recruit children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have hired undocumented migrants themselves and feared they would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by going ahead and claiming any children.
The threat was further heightened in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults or older members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, presented evidence to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of the individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors household are living in the country illegally and most of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those individuals", Mr. Elben said.
Demanding that the children be prepared quickly, the authorities introduced new rules that required children to appear in court within a month of being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the sheltered staff.
Many people appear via video conference call rather than appearing in person to present their case to an immigration judge for legal status.
Those who are deemed unfit for release are immediately dismissed.
The longer children remain in captivity, the more likely they are to be left feeling upset or depressed, which may escalate into violent impulses or escape attempts, according to security personnel and system reports in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said that those cases are moved to a high-end facility like Tornillo, where signs that the child is struggling are ignored because of their size.
He added that taking children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or saying goodbye to friends would only add to the shock they are already struggling with.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupying military forces
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maolem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the war in the country was now in its eighth year.
Maullam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said that foreign military forces are illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw from the war zone immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Maulm stressed that the war in Syria is almost over, "where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been uprooted from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this "supernatural war until we both clear all Syrian territories of all terrorist groups and "no foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly to train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
In the case of refugees, Maullam said that conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading fear of futility" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They were politicizing a purely human issue".
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would receive no aid for reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was reached to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib creates an opportunity to put further pressure on political dialogue, say US politicians.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement averted a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, which was home to three million people.
However, Maullam said the agreement has a "clear timeline" and also expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda linked to the Nusra Front, who will be "wiped out".
United States Representative Staff Di Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution to fix Syria and the electoral path.
Maulm put certain conditions on the committee for the Syrian government's participation, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warn against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless many liberals or elites are hoping for some impeachment and scandal to end his term prematurely.
Without a doubt, "this will be the most dramatic end to the national post ever!"
So far, no fatigue was seen in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings on CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and on MSNBC have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers over the past four years, with more than 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers, with the major news broadcast at night.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we don't understand", said Neil Baer, the director of an ABC drama about the Cabinet Secretary "Designated Survivor" who becomes president after being destroyed in an attack on the U.S. Capitol.

The value of entertainment was in the disorder.
Of course, beyond TV and other things, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the unification of immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Only privileged spectators could afford to ignore it.
And yet, it's beyond being an informed citizen, when you find yourself watching a six-hour panel of experts debate, using Woodward's original reasoning for "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 bomber jacket ("A thick cloth with a hubris", said the Washington Post), and the implications of Storm Daniels's disingenuous description of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario like that again.
Brent Montgomery, the producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pon Stars", said "as part of everything he does, that makes it just like a reality show where he brings you something new every night", which is about the rotating cast of Trump's show and the plot twists of the day (selecting any fights, Kim Jong-un's praise from the N.F.L.).
You cannot risk missing a single episode or you will be left behind.

The race for the House of Representatives has been flooded with foreign money in the strong middle class.
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, which was credited to the rebuilding of the congressional district, which led to two incumbents running for the same seat.
That recently opened the way for Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb of suburban Pittsburgh - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamp was also involved in a second office race, with Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th.
After this decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January in the case of unconstitutional forgery in favor of the Republicans by the old districts, the maps were re-created.
The empty handed battle between the major financial arms in the new 17th race, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), had touched the economy of the campaign.
Lamb's name became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That is why the seat had been held by Republicans for almost a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political pundits incited the democrats a little further.
The US punishes El Salvador for supporting China, then backs down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing due to resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a lively meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the management team of the Trump Organization fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Department spokeswoman Heather Nort said in a statement that "on the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development and financial aid.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When internal meetings or meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference, focusing on security and economic prosperity, to follow that rally or mob like last year, which was seen as a further move by the UN in an effort to stop immigrants from leaving.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end with any penalty or fine for El Salvador in mind.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of importing administrative spaces at the conference.
And three Americans quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or debate described by three US officials, including two politicians, who agree to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also speaks on condition of anonymity.

The next case may be the report of the Special Council on the possible obstruction of justice to Mr. Trump, of which there is now ample evidence in the public record.
At the same time, Mr Mueller reportedly reverses his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign is colluding with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress joins hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable to that body, as he prepares to go before voters again and perhaps a jury of his colleagues.

We failed, and as a result we missed the opportunity to stop so many years of genocide.
The functioning of historical centers and the unrelenting march of democracy around such points of divergence is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these points of divergence.
If Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentine, the person who controlled the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation, what are we going to do?
Rosentine has been in this dilemma since the paper reported it last year, suggesting that the president be kept secret and considered unfit for office.
Mr. Rosentine said that the account of The Times is not accurate.
"If the recently requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he persists in the Supreme Court despite substantiated allegations of sexual abuse and perjury, how will we react?
And beyond that, will we vote for Congress in the midterm, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those tests, democracy will survive the long winter.
But I think that because of the lessons I learned in Prague, we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had previously occupied my embassy house.
She survived and moved to America, and 60 years later they sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table made of swastika.

Graham Doran's Rangers are still optimistic after the intense Vienna clash
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, beating the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Duran from making his first appearance in the season leading up to the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good thing for us because the vilarials were good", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something and come to a conclusion.
Maybe we can get it in the end, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving on to Thursday, it is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they got good results with the crowd or the crowd behind us in their last game, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
With everything that happened with my injuries and the changes made at the club itself last year was certainly difficult but now it is a good experience at this place.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
Hopefully we can move on from our last session and succeed".
Women are losing their sleep because of this retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly knew what kind of care they needed, some were talking to their family members about it.
Almost half of the individuals nationwide said they were talking to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or care for them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate", said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be prepared to care for your family if you do not tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how to get care, as those options can be important factors in determining cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor may also suggest ways to pay for those expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help pay for these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have the money.
Present your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a healthcare proxy so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that if you are unable to communicate or negotiate, the professionals follow your wishes.
Also, consider a power of attorney to oversee your finances.
You will select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is taken to the hospital.
So can you answer their questions about their medications and allergies?
Put that information in a written plan so that you are prepared.
"It's not just the financials that are involved, but who is the doctor?" asked Martin.

A man fired several shots into the air in Lafracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was walking home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in Lafracombe, Devon, in the Oxford Grove area, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials describe the shooting of BST at around 02:30 am as a "random incident".
The victim could not see his attacker.
His wounds were not so deep that the police appealed to him to testify.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
When communications were cut off, rescue officials were unable to get any information from Dongola Regency, the northern region of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, over 16,000 people trapped in the disaster were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongola, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the shores of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongola is a seaside regency in the northwest of Sulawesi Island, extending over 300 kilometres (180 mi).
The Regency below the administrative province has an estimated population of 299, up from 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of maximum Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Alphabetization Agency, in the last 100 years, tsunamis have knocked on the floors of Palu and Dongola several times.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongola killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck western Dongola, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire in terms of seismicity and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes also hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude tsunami triggered a tsunami on Indonesia's most populous island, Java, which exploded off the southern coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang affected the area that is the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai island off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters to devastate dozens of villages and kill about 300 people.
2016: A leachate earthquake in AK hit the Pidi Jaya Regency, causing devastation and displacement as it reminded people of the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes devastate the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily helpless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of East Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the state of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he would take the phone from her.
According to KTUU reports, Palin was sent back to the Maut-Suu pretrial facility and also fined an unsecured bond of $500.
The network reported that he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for testimony.
Palin faced three Class A felonies, where he could be sentenced to up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor with a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veterans Affairs.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence reporting, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming in Iraq.
Indonesia: Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed after earthquakes struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
As the death rate increased in the coming days, electricity and communication networks were also not working.
The earthquake struck in Central Sulawesi, which is the northeastern region of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact were circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people gathered in the city of Palo for the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the NYC attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a rare death sentence for Safoulo Saipov, suspected of the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare sentence given in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly uses a home depot rental truck to attack with a bike on a westbound highway path in lower Manhattan while cutting off pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the report of intent to seek the death penalty imposed in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" physically injured them".
Both these countries potentially impose the death penalty according to the court document.
A week after the raid, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for aiding and abetting racketeering, which are used by federal prosecutors specifically in organized crime cases and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The prosecutors said the attack required "adequate planning and prior deliberation", explaining the manner in which Saipov carried it out in a "hateful, cruel and vicious" manner.
"Safulau Habibulavic Saipov injured and harmed the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves Enlarged Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Eliz, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Elzandro Pagunco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The trial of the previous death penalty case in the Southern District of New York has been going on for a decade.
Mulzim Khalid Brain was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence was handed down in 1953 in a New York federal case for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Joan Rosenberg was executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A local resident of Uzbekistan, Saipov, had no regrets or regrets for days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he liked what he did.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone meeting the crime.
Police said he also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He requested not to be guilty of the offence of 22.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says he is "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think our decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of release would only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include everyone", Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz vowed to 'gather an army of people' during the protest at the Tory conference.
The eastern UKIP leader asked politicians to 'understand the mood' with Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested they should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary, Britain would have been 'out' by now.
But the challenges Mrs May faced in addressing her highly divided ranks have been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories to add a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
Premier has struggled to keep his checkered compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiters, Remoners and the EU.
The allies urged that she try to negotiate a compromise with Brussels instead of backlash - and force eurosceptics and workers to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said that to leave means to leave the rally at Solihull, where he wants to 'throw the checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
The MP for Wellingborough said: 'I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out.'
Setting the tone for the EU, he said: 'We don't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr Bone dismissed all suggestions that had changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and they want to stay is completely false.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also in the march saying: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent among our party and our activists who actually blockade the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please stop checking and start listening.'
In a focused message to Mrs. Ma, he said: "The Prime Minister keeps his jobs, when he does not break his promise".
Shri Faraj said that the leaders of the rally should be made to 'feel the mood' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
He said, 'It is now a matter between us - the people and our political classes.'
'They are trying to cheat Brexit and today we are here to tell them 'we will not let you get away with it.'
Addressing the eager crowd, he said: 'I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of cheating Brexit by understanding the climate.
'We are assembling the army of the people of this country who have won us over in Brexit and who will not rest until we are a free, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the Remnants march from Birmingham before a two-hour rally through the city centre.
A group of activists pointed to the Tories against the Brexit banner after the launch of this weekend's group.
Labour peer Lord Adonis pretends to talk about security issues with the party app at the opening of the conference.
'These are the people who are telling us that they can have the right IT system and all the technology for Canada, for borderless free trade and borderless free trade in Ireland.
'This is a complete slang.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to take a 'tough view' on the president's operations
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close eye on the president's operations" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
A regular critic of President Donald Trump, Warren GOP state icon Geoff DeHale is running for re-election in November, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There was speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was Trump's 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall format since taking office.
One of the attendees asked if she was going to join the presidential race.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go out and fix our broken government and put women first".
LSU arrested in Sim's death
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET at the news conference or conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sim, 20, was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Police Chief Murphy G. Paul told Per 247 Sport on Saturday that "Wed Sim died from a gunshot wound to the head".
Wade went on to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
Simpson was asked about the incident and he admitted to killing Wade Sim with a gun.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-by-6-foot junior who grew up with Betten disease, Sim played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton eliminates the world title after the team's victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valterri Bottas was qualified to play a big part in the Louis Hamilton Mercedes Team Order race on Saturday.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and knocked out Hamilton as he made his way through the first two turns and invited Vatel to create a standoff with his team's drivers.
Wettle went to the pits first and left Hamilton in the traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was one lap behind and came out from behind Vettel but Hamilton took the lead after some wheel-to-wheel action which saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly defend at the third corner leaving without any risk after a double-move.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh when he reached the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
He then moved on to a larger part of the race where he focused on changing his tyres and quickly overtook KM Racconen in fourth place.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44 but was unable to pick up his pace for the remaining eight laps, when Rekonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day when Valterri did a great job all weekend and is a really nice gentleman.
The team performed brilliantly, scoring one or two, Hamilton said.
It was a really bad gesture.
President Donald Trump on Saturday lied to Senator Dean Feinstein at his request not to leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the statement letter given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current state of the Senate, saying that people are "mean and mean and dishonest".
"There's a very good thing or thing that could happen in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people", he said.
"When you see the release and the leak and then they say, "Hey, I didn't do it".
I did not do this".
Do you remember?
Dean Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer -- did you leak the document -- "Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no. What are you doing?
I did not leak".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn 't leak, he said, pointing to the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter back in July detailing the charges brought against Kawangua by Ford and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that it was leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She told me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as she said".
But the president did not find his denial appropriate, commenting at a Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you, it was a really bad gesture.
Maybe he didn't, but I've rarely seen such bad gestures before".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President pointed out that the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see their arrogance, their filth and also that they don 't care who they hurt or who they run after to get power or power or control", the mediator reported the President 's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Deaver scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for the loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5 - 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants initially gained a two-goal lead through attacks from Patrick Doyer and Francis Beaulieu.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowney took the home side level before the Giants took the lead and re-established Dior.
Francois Bochard tied it for Dundee before Lucas Lundwalt Nielsen secured the win by two goals.
It was the third elite defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's man, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With the Giants winning their last three games, this was the fourth meeting of the season on the Sides.
Dwyer's opener Candle McFaul came on in the fourth minute at 3:35, with David Rutherford helping Beaulieu to double the lead in the next four minutes.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned to show his home game at 13:10 before Matt Merquadrat tied Cooney at 15:16.
Doyer ensures that the Giants take the lead at the first break until he scores his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regroup and Bosshard once again brings them to the level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Neilson lead Dundee for the first time in the second period of the match and he secured victory in his team's fifth halfway in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost their last five games so far, are now set to play their next game on Friday at their home ground of Milton Keane.
Air traffic controllers were killed to ensure that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero, since he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could land safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, activating a tsunami.
The subsequent shocks in the region continued to wreak havoc and many people were trapped under the rubble in the town of Palu.
But while his colleagues were fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Egang refused to leave his busy controlled post at the Paleo airport at the Siis Al-Jufri airport in Mutiara.
He remained there to ensure that Beatic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died in hospital.
Johannes Sirtrate, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Clemton to take him from another city to a larger hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter reached the turn.
"We were heartbroken to see him go", she said.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country is devastated, with access to Dongola, Sigi and Botunesh being limited, the Alpine Agency says.
"The death rate may still be on the rise as many bodies may still be buried in debris or debris, or in many places that are inaccessible", said agency spokesman Sutopo Ngoroho.
Waves rising up to six meters destroyed the Palu, leading to a mass burial on Sunday.
The army and commercial aircraft are bringing in support and supplies.
Reisa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances were bringing in the bodies.
Access to clean water is rare.
Everywhere, small markets were looted".
The head of the International Red Cross, Jan Galvand, told CNN: "Indonesia is racing to help Red Cross survivors, but we don't know what they will get there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake hit in Indonesia, in the province of Lobong, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nyugi now reports that one man is missing since the lagoon plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Macedonia now says one man is missing, after 47 passengers and crew were last reported to have been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Nyugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for uncertain information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane went into the water while trying to land at the Chalk Island airport, local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them are now stable.
The cause of the crash and the manner in which it occurred is unclear.
The airline and the US Navy say both planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought that the plane did not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jane said the plane had come down too low.
Jane said, "That's a very good thing".
Jane said she and others were pulled out of the deep water by an emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew were panicked and screaming and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the pier also helped rescue by using a wind boat to bring people ashore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people were killed in PNG-registered airline crashes over the past two decades but no airlines were involved.
The analyst reported the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution resumed its case on Saturday to retry a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The department of U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis.
She told the jury how she used cellphone records to piece together the activities of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rolette said she obtained location data from several cell phones, which showed that the deceased was with Tallis Chambers on the evening of her death, denying her previous claims, The Clarion-Laser reported.
When the data showed that when he said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, his cell phone was in the Chambers at the time, the police informed Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented evidence that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tallis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville".
The second discrepancy was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rolette said that shortly after Chamber's death, Tallis deleted all Chamber's texts or messages, calls or contact information from his phone.
"She erased him from her life", said Hale.
The defence is set to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected to go to the jury for the trial that day.
High Breed: What is conscious or conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has drifted from its roots to deal with political messages and social issues.
He wanted to move away from his roots and reawaken popular hip-hop.
Artists like Fugees and Common saw a recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Alaka and Loki.
Another black person?!
NY Nanny sues couple after firing after "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for biased shooting after a mother complains that she is "the other black person".
The couple denies they are racist, suing for "abduction".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expresses her displeasure when she discovers that new babysitter Giselle Morris, who was black on her first day of work in 2016, is a black.
"No other black person", Mrs. Plasco Flaxman said to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, explaining that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and he was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home in Uber for her day's work.
Now, Morris is demanding the couple's dismissal and $350 compensation per day for six months, although she was hired to start work at the live-in gig without any contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do anything like that", he said in a post on Friday, explaining that "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to claims that they were racist, stating that after insulting him they could not trust him, it was appropriate to terminate Morris' employment.
"My wife sent something that she didn 't mean.
He is not racist.
We are not racist people", husband Joe Plasco told the Post.
But can you give your children to someone you have ever abused, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn?
Let it go".
Like the "abduction" case, Plasco said his wife had had a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone?
It is not right to do this", said the investment banker.
While the legal proceedings are still ongoing, the couple has reacted swiftly to the accusations on social media, silencing them for their behavior and reasoning.
Pedistin publishers fear that readers will not link it to their own thoughts and opinions, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkins, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It is difficult to imagine anyone putting themselves in their place when reading it for the first time before it is published.
It's amazing to know how successful Paddington is".
Speaking of his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a little bear toy, he was optimistic about the rejection of his work, saying that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book was both "happiness and sadness" after his death.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of her family", she says that her father was proud of his potential success.
"He was a quiet man and not at all conceited", she said.
"But because Pendington was so real to them, it was almost like you have a child who gets something: you're proud of them, even though you're not actually doing it.
I think that's how they saw the success of Paddington.
Though it was his imagination and his creation, he always credited Paddington with it".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pastore 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors was in vain.
"Ned was regularly saying that it was really bad, he didn't expect that", said Mrs. Adnen-Laprus.
"Then Ned called me and told me that she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors had given her to keep her heart beating was gradually leaving her system.
She had died a while ago and it would have all stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn't do anything, scream or cry, because I was surrounded by my family.
I had to handle everyone".
Finally Mrs. Adenain-Laprus, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of what they were going through.
"Nobody knows", he said.
"I did my head down and was crying all the time.
It was hard to express, but I could see the feeling of extreme sympathy for Ned on the plane.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her".
Postcards of victims of suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Callie Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages that people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 when he suffered from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mr. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising chef who spread his smile everywhere.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that his smile could light up everywhere".
However, he had quit his job before he died and was living in a "very dark room".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was searching for his missing sibling, after which he committed suicide.
"I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect", said Ms. Davis.
Ms. Davis made cards, "to let people know that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if they're not friends.
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphries, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old friend Mark shortly after her mother died.
"He didn 't say anything that he was feeling sad or sad or anything else", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we made some changes in his behaviour.
He was so sad on Christmas day - he couldn't look them in the eye when the children opened their presents".
She said that her death was a great shock to her, but she had to get over it: "It tore the family apart from the inside.
It made us sad.
But we all had to fight".

When the FBI investigation began, Kawangwa's future was in the balance.
"I thought, if I could actually find something that he's looking for - a limited time and limited scope investigation - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he fears the committee is "breaking up" amid alleged biased gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kawangua and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance was due to time.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 - as expected, Republicans perform very poorly, so they would be seriously weakened in their efforts to win on the ground in the Supreme Court that they sought.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the senator, promotes him to support Mr. Quanguay, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will be on the ballot.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kuangwa could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, the vice president, had to do by abolishing it and confirming it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean fugitives 'fallen' by Kim
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea declined when John-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the Southern Integration Ministry, Park Byung-seog said 1,127 people had fled their duty last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and customs evasion were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Koreans are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The maximum fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and the easiest to cross the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats fugitives as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically in a state of war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries meet in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the blockade denuclearization talks.
It was activated after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim John-un in Singapore in June, when they broadly agreed to the terms of working towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no choice but to unilaterally harm ourselves first", Mr Rai said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "funny", saying he was not qualified for the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "funny" and said he was naturally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't think of a woman who would even perform like that, they call it 'fun,'" Pelosi said Thursday, responding to Kawangwa's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kawangwa emotionally denied allegations that he ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kawangua was very emotional, sometimes screaming and holding his breath while talking about his family and his school years.
He blatantly punished the Democrats on the committee by disproving allegations of "strange and coordinated character assassination" by liberals who were angry over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential loss.
Pelosi said he felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was anti-Democrat.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and also the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi questioned whether she would still blame Kavanaugh if Kavanaugh becomes permanent and Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit for the Supreme Court, but he can work now because he's invited", Pelosi said.
Kawangwa is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kawangwa's potential regulations against affordable care in the Act or Roe v. Wade, as they are known to do conservative justice.
In his certification hearing, Kavangua avoided questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
"In his confirmation hearing, Kavangua's questions were dismissed as to whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
And women need to shake it.
It is a religious insult, months and years of anger come out and she cannot stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stamins told me 45 years later, "When we cry, we get angry".
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was helped a lot by a woman who works as an officer somewhere, who said that even she, when she gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she's talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And then she kept talking.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of an early job, a man-headed office, is when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, finding an elderly woman holding my neck from behind - a sharp manager I had always been a little afraid of - who dragged me down the stairs.
He said "Never cry in front of anyone".
"They don 't know how angry you are.
They think you 're sad and you 'll be happy to see them. "
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair other than marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was deeply disappointed, decided to run for president herself.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", he told me laughing after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was delayed, she did not have time to raise funds and so she vowed that she would not run until she had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who had given the men $1,000 would only give him $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she could not contain her emotions - gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds, and frustration with even the targeted voters rather than representatives and anger at sexism - she began to suffocate.
"You would have thought I would have had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press must have reacted to her.
"You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they're going to put on my grave?
"She cried"?""
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvos of the trade war between the US and China were slowing down and while the war is far from over, the rifts between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said that the first warning was issued earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week with new tariffs affecting up to $200 billion (£150 billion) in items, effectively taxing more than half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has responded in its own way each time, most recently slapping tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world's second largest economy is likely to shake soon.
Getting Washington back means hollowing out demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be very embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say Beijing can move on, the US trade war can positively support China in the long run while reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that either start an economic tailspin in the country is actually even more dangerous than what viewers have seen before", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New America Security, a think tank focusing on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to take back refugees, foreign minister says
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and was appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Maulm said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to the progress made in countering terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees due to terrorism to the country and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maulm said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he insisted that it would not accept any conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Jorn's teen reaches the 14.5 points needed to beat the American, Europe regains its title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, took the match from Francisco Molinari to show his T-shot in the water at the par 3 16th hole.
Italian golfer Molinari became the first of four players to win all his rounds since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979 to a 5-0-0 record.
American Jordan Speith was defeated by the lowest ranked player of the European team by Thorbjone Olesen of Denmark 5 and 4.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Donson, lost 2-1 to England's Lan Poulter, who played perhaps his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European to win the tournament every time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
So thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm so happy that I could help", Gracia said emotionally after the European win.
He turned the torch on his teammate John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Wood 2-1 in Sunday's single play.
Rahm, 23, said, "I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Wood, I grew up watching him".
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
One of the greatest players of all time has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nichols.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a fareway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finney, who played golf with full caliber throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furke said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I am proud of these boys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played a great game.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and move forward with Thosum.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
You should greet them.
We played better".
