28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall.
The victim's brother testified that he could not think of anyone who would want to harm him, "finally he got his life back on track".
The body found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall has been identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco Coroner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told San Francisco's KGO that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, got his dream job six months ago as a chef at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
A Sons & Daughters spokesman said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team working as a close family and we will miss him", the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things were finally going downhill for him".
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend", Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook for us, to prepare dinner for us", said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who went with the flow.
"With everything that was going wrong in the world, he was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day", he said.
Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the SFPD's tip line at 415-575-4444.
I'm always being put in boxes.
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made that clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or labelled from the outside, which have little to do with me and reality".
"I myself have no desire to be perfect and successful all the time".
"Honestly, I'm not really that into these things".
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh at being called "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current issue of "Cosmopolitan".
The magazine says that the actress prefers to spend her time at home, watching television, eating loose-footed, Mexican food.
It brings to the fore the question of childbearing: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect", says the Hollywood star.
In her new film Mother's Day, Aniston is portrayed as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be shown on August 25th.
Golf player Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is comprehensible.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of a change with a ride out on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a first.
CHIO: 'Golden sports pyramid' for Bernhard Langer, who has been awarded the European Sports Hall of Fame
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening, and they galloped home to the feeders.
A mile at that pace, I was afraid.
"It was not a good experience", says Langer.
And that was the end of my riding career.
On Saturday, Germany's greatest golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near the horses.
He and his family were led around the ALRV facility, and he didn't even get on a horse for a photo.
Langer's first time in Aachen and the first time at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid awarded the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid in a small gala.
The athlete is not lacking in awards.
Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel, Champions Tour player of the year...
Even the Queen of England has knighted him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met on Saturday the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler.
"This award means a lot to me", says Langer, "because it's not just for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment".
Langer has been nurturing the young for decades.
And so he passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athlete Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the runner Eberhard Gienger, the swordsman Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the bob rider Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company walked to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was held.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump economic policies compared: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TPP trade deal - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
The two candidates for the US presidency, however, disagree on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are rooted in a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep it small in the case of doubt, and warns about how the state can hurt the economy with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
But he would be very different, Trump claims.
He's going to slash regulations massively, and he's pushing for sweeping tax reform with lower tax rates for individuals and businesses.
Clinton says, on the other hand, that the state has certain duties to fulfill, it has to provide opportunities for the disadvantaged and it needs money for that.
That's why the taxes on the rich would be raised, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close on the infrastructure.
It is a question of investing in it, say Trump and Clinton almost in unison.
The Democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government infrastructure investment programs are classic democratic policies and are strongly opposed by the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party, which is critical of the government.
So Trump could still have party-wide discussions.
The differences between energy and climate policy are more apparent.
Trump wants to build coal plants and start coal mining in the US again.
The Commission is also proposing to make oil extraction possible in protected areas, and to abrogate the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energy in her investment program, and says: "One country will become the clean energy superpower and create millions of jobs".
"It's going to be either China or Germany or America - I want us to be".
But not only in infrastructure - international trade agreements are not too far apart.
TPP, the Transpacific Trade Agreement, both of them don't want to sign.
At the same time, both sides do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to protect American jobs better.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the amount of money that can be spent on the environment.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not entirely clear: first he says: the minimum wage must be raised, then he says it must not be changed.
The big debate in the coming months, however, will probably be about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to ease the burden on the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
Critics of the budget say that it will only increase the deficit.
On the other hand, there's Clinton, who wants to at least require the rich to pay more taxes, and her critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Every refugee woman has experienced sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost a daily occurrence for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house is a shelter.
In a large kitchen, four women are sitting.
Each one has a baby, one year old at most.
One of them was carrying her little boy.
He looks curiously into the room with wide eyes.
His mother stares at the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the area manager of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are fugitives.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodation facilities for single migrant women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
Sixty people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard outside the door.
"It is no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence during her escape", says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars, political persecution, threats of torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as bearers of hope", she says.
Women have other reasons for fleeing: "Many steal because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriage, honor killings, slavery, or forced prostitution.
It drives them away.
The escape is the continuation.
"It is not uncommon for traffickers to demand sexual acts in exchange for a bottle of water", says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they're not protected by their families.
Whoever thinks that this will end once they arrive in Germany is crazy, says Bahr.
Here, too, women living alone in refugee shelters are often seen as inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, she estimates that about 90 percent of the women living in the shelter in the north of Munich are traumatized.
"Some of the children were not born of their own free will".
Many women are so used to not saying anything.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about what they've experienced because the shame is too great".
Since they often cannot help themselves, more housing is needed just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked if they knew of a similar project in their area of responsibility as in Munich, some say no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
In Swabia alone, women refugees are not separated from men, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a government spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, some communal accommodation has floors or private houses for single women and their children only.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central shelters exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the committee states: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately".
"A lack of privacy or the coexistence of men and women can lead to - ongoing - violence against women".
The study says that washing rooms should be separate and easily accessible to women.
The degree to which women feel this need for protection can be seen in the demand for the house in Munich.
"Since we've been around, we've had a long waiting list", says Bahr.
You could easily open a second home.
Strikes by medical assistants: demands for new work-related measures
The representatives of the assistant doctors called on their union to approve new measures of industrial action in their disputes over a new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on its entire Council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "quite calm" on issues that led to the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and requested formal renegotiation of all your concerns".
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor strikes beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to six paramedic strikes this year, the first total blackouts in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members in meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical assistants and students that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be forced on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St Petersburg Palace, I cannot help feeling that Ankara wants this reconciliation most of all.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile was narrow-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his reserved circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "dear friend" Putin - one report says as many as five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described how Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a sustained coolness emanating from Putin showed that the Russian head of state had not forgotten anything.
The European Parliament has already been informed of the situation in Syria, and we are very pleased that the European Union has taken the initiative to respond to the crisis.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin accused Ankara of backstabbing Russia and said that the Russian government had not acted in accordance with the law.
The crime was even more serious, since it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unabated attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
The only reason this meeting took place was because President Erdogan had given Mr Putin the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia could have some kind of victory.
The advantages of a ceasefire are clear to Ankara.
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after being nearly removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has dropped by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They're counting on a late-season Mediterranean raid.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists over there, tomatoes over here".
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover a weak response.
In addition, there is the continuing resentment over the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and to diminish Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is, of course, a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent, as one analyst once described to me, "an alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West and are now allying.
However, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides.
It might be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they had not even touched the subject.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it's surely better that the two heads of state at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's CEO.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself from the public since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and was rescued.
During this time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial brands.
It supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she's decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller retail brands that are gaining more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and staff in Invernessshire during a tour of the site.
He told BBC Scotland: 'The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands.'
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to become the bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" the CEO said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for our customers and launch these brands.
But with our work, with our focus on customer needs and not our own, I think we're going to see a lot of changes.
We can relaunch those brands, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori has won his 3,000th Newmarket on Predilection.
Dettori splashes champagne after a double at Newmarket, earning his 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He's betting on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, to make a milestone at his local racetrack with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in flat racing.
He is followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before that, said, "It's something special".
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket, because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big gathering, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a commonplace Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori's cheering as he takes the win at Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in obstacle racing - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who has amassed more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, has 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of modern times, and it's no surprise that he has achieved this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He has style and he's strong, but it's his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight room.
He's a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has thrilled fans for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and grand tournament jockey!
Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for British racing, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-racking.
A string of major tournament wins, including his famous "Great Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had some initial difficulties when he returned from his six-month ban, but he showed impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he's not finished yet - Dettori once said that he wants to continue competing until he's at least 50.
Russian President Putin fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was for many years part of Putin's innermost circle of trust.
The 63-year-old has been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Putin, without giving any reason, "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration".
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website (in Russian) it is stated that he later became Chief of Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government Staff.
On his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your confidence".
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state in drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that he had asked Ivanov to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This move has wrapped Moscow in mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants, and like him, he works for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few here are convinced of that - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president would suddenly want to lead Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in a conversation in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated - one could almost say - burdensome post for four years.
As it turns out, I've been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Before that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term would have violated the constitution.
But that post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat up producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced in a joint statement that he was fired.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized Thursday before announcing his resignation.
There were artistic differences and a disagreement on the set.
I regret the incident", he said in a statement.
Details of how the character of Gibson will be written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have poured my heart and blood into it for the last 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there to the end, but that's not going to be possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful crew, and most of all, the best fans you could ever want for a show.
The twelfth season is scheduled to air on September 28th.
Mystery of Fishes Landing in the Garden at Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals that were spat out of a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 yards from the ocean, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hopes that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossings to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four "deck fan" closures nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The Fife section of the bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, and 46 ropes.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing an engineering feat of truly epic proportions on this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used on this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate task requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is getting a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first lock is a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the lock represents future-oriented construction.
After the last section of road deck had been installed and connected to the North Tower deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by dragging the northern supply bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be dragged upwards at a gradient of about 3%.
Hectic, since the tolerances the team was working toward were tiny - just a few millimeters on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming to safety, while their boat kept moving under its own power.
"We saw the boat turn around nearby and imagined the worst", said Vince Jones, the head of the Moelfre rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds had already blown the boat out of range before we were able to get out to sea", he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all got on the lifeboat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and alive.
The boat's engine had an emergency stop, but it detached from the person steering the boat when the boat was tilted.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Man stabs his ex-girlfriend, seriously injured
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
Police said the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to retrieve his personal belongings.
Instead, the drunken killer cut up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she entered the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old woman was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old was destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
The police then alerted the sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old woman wanted to calm her brother.
But she could not get him to leave the apartment.
So she and her companion left the house.
They met the man's ex-partner on the street.
When the two women reentered the apartment, the 50-year-old man pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who is building affordable housing in Brunswick?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more accountable in future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable housing units in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing a 'living action plan' for the next Council meeting.
But the fight is programmed.
The first question is: Who should build the affordable housing?
There is no regulation yet.
The SPD group leader Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban land, you will have to designate 20 percent of all housing as social housing".
However, the affordable housing can also be built in stock.
The big issue at the town hall, however, is how to deal with investors who want to build on private land.
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but possibly 20 percent of the housing on such land as social housing".
A new urban housing subsidy program, which will cost millions and has yet to be funded, is supposed to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann, is that there is no agreement between the groups at the moment.
The CDU wants to impose as few regulations as possible on investors.
The Left wants to make the conditions for investors even tougher.
Nevertheless, says Bratmann, there is a risk of a worsening of the housing market.
If the action plan is implemented, it will provide for additional tasks in the construction management.
More personnel are needed.
It's unclear if we'll get the skilled workers.
But the programme is not complete yet, because the 1260 new homes that were supposed to be built anyway, are not.
But how do we compensate for the loss of another 1300 or so affordable homes that will be closed in the next few years?
By the year 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to planning spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring bonds should now be purchased from the city.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future.
That's possible in the West City.
It would solve the problem in one fell swoop.
Because in Westtown, the deadlines run out at the end of the year.
Around 1,800 apartments could be brought back into the price bracket for affordable housing.
It's just that the owners, the housing companies, don't want it.
The number of social housing units in the Westtown is again drastically increasing, and this is a step away from the goal of so-called mixing.
The concentration of the socially weak in a few districts should no longer exist.
The Greens expect there to be movement in the debate.
The European Parliament has voted in favour of the report, but has not yet voted in favour of the report.
They're focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot still be found.
Pokémon Go, a health and happiness hunt that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting them to get active.
Screen time was first limited to television, then video games, and finally smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the Pokémon Go craze, an app based on the characters originally created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed into an animated series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the game declined slightly before its release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when they were younger joined the craze and jumped for the couch.
In the United States, gambling has led to a considerable increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked who exercise 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go -- it just sees the raw data to boost performance.
A lot of public health education campaigns that want to get people to "take 30 minutes", "get off the couch", and "be active every day" have been met with deaf ears, because a lot of public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Regular exercise reduces the risk of cancer and depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy game-breakers who always have something to complain about.
And yes, someone could run into a door.
What's the matter?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity before, they haven't given us a reason to exercise the way this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.
But with the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping a lot of people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles takes gold in the all-around
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Easy on the beam.
It's amazing on the floor.
Brilliant in every way.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in full view of the Olympic spotlight.
Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
American Simone Biles is on the pole during the women's singles final in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American to win a mixed martial arts title and fifth overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, or even of all time.
She burst into tears when her final score was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.
This achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I have ever seen".
She was facing a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of over-sized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.
American Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver in the women's singles final in gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while serving as the cheerleader at the retirement party for retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that during her long climb to the top, she never planned for the future, that's not really true.
Part of their floor exercise - which includes their typical tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school field trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn't lost a fight since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was leading by two turns, the picture carried.
Floating beams and ground turrets - in which Biles holds the world title - were buzzing.
She made up for it with 15.433 on the balance beam and 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman embraced her gently as they awaited her final fate -- a mere formality -- and tears streamed down Biles's shiny red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her book of collected works became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebreaker went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, known to the Americans as "Gomma", had a head start.
After her floor exercise, she threw kissing hands at the audience, overcome by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's rapidly spreading tweet earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial murder case shot while listening to music in the car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot and killed in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case while they were chatting in a car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled in another vehicle, the report said.
Police said the triple homicide did not appear to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Police Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting had led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others were injured in nine attacks in four months in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house", Howard told KHPO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
It's believed the suspect used multiple vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to release the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck a half-hour before the triple murder, and is believed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge cases and recovered a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't get into that.
Which is not true at all -- of course, you've got to get into it", she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never be able to recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first response to that was, 'I didn't know that people still do that,'" explained Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still cannot speak.
But he's making slow progress.
He can walk and ride a bike with assistance.
He also enjoys playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth is showing the sign language that Edmund came up with for "Please sing me a song".
"We are teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language, she says.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic, as in Edmund, and infections with viruses such as measles or Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary widely.
It's too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking myself, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to actually tell me.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know you're gonna get better.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding and rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and more rain is expected throughout the state Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and south of the Mississippi River flooded their banks, threatening widespread flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is on the way to affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that Tangipahoa Parish alone had requested 10,000 sandbags.
A flood warning system will be in place across much of south Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service said that the area could get an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain.
An early warning system was activated in southern Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are expected to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish would be a hazard, as the rivers that are being trodden will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on record as early as 9:00 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams are still pulling people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring in and pouring in", Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife Hansford said that in the 48 years she had lived there, she had never seen the river rise to such a height.
Hansford said that he and his family members were all handicapped and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread quickly" as heavy rains continued and that authorities were considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the ground was substantially soaked by the rains that had fallen since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and flooding of roads caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the suspension of classes in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a deputy reported 200 homes flooded in Tangipahoa.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
Community leader Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been washed away by floodwaters.
Emergency shelters were set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"As soon as the water starts to go down, they will be able to go back to their homes", he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags were provided for residents to take with them, hoping to keep the water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March", said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it was continuing to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none were reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", said Townson, "and it's still coming".
Mahaj Brown, 6, "shot through", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old this week.
The boy's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to the hip, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was conscious during transportation to the hospital.
"He has suffered a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was deemed critical at a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two men aged 29 and a man aged 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car with the 29-year-old man, who is in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrator.
Investigators have told CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a crossfire between multiple shooters.
Shotgun holsters traced back to various assault rifles were strewn across the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the sidewalk, were shells.
So it seems there were several armed fighters here who were very actively involved", Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance footage.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow in the arm while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm imagining for the women's Olympic gymnastics team, and for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been an inspiration to many young women of color.
The structure of this team, which is rounded off by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is a source of pride.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has cemented the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the last four years, the number one female athlete has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in an individual women's doubles event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're seeing the pinnacle of the sport, but that's not what gyms across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same route as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They're the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four female athletes on the team, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnastics is primarily in private gyms, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, accommodation, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their athletes and families).
The majority of these gyms are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
These clubs provide all the training for the gymnasts, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to give communities and countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie a more achievable and accessible form of physical activity.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my events, we've provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we're going to expand to Detroit, my hometown, to offer high-quality gymnastics to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits to health, academic and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that's getting thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics, and that's great.
It's so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by winning Olympic Team Gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls from diverse backgrounds to begin their journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Nurses want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officers of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 medical assistants who voted in a vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract into force, saying the NHS was in "no-man's land" and any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unwelcoming times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's committee on physician assistants, said in a statement last night: "Physicians assistants continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current employment crisis and fail to treat all physicians fairly".
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through dialogue have been met with reluctant government involvement and sometimes deafening silence.
This was the result of a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now to lift the suspension and address the concerns of the attending physicians".
If he does not, the paramedics have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further labor strikes.
The last strike in late April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialist doctors were brought in to provide cover for doctors on the strike-chain.
The Ministers had hoped to settle the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the officers of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly rate for the 54,000 paramedics who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS Staff, called on the paramedics to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Working-squad measures achieve little, but they put a strain on already overworked teams and providers, and cause anxiety, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families".
Over the past two months, we've been talking to the Medical Assistant Committee and working with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to respond positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a work break, training costs, mutual recognition of curriculum, continuing training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about meeting the February, November and May agreements with the BMA.
The £2 a day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 a day drug, after it was recommended by the authorities to give it to more people for a longer period.
The anticoagulant Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory body NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people have a heart attack every year, and a quarter of those will have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty material buildup in the arterial walls, which forms coatings.
If the coating breaks, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream, blocking blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had one heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely that blood clots will form.
The draft NICE guidance published today recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with aspirin taken twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences".
The fear of a heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience has shown that ticagrelor, when combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By making a preliminary recommendation for Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from them.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years, and the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Political Correctness culture allows voter fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year following a government report into corruption.
A culture of political correctness has resulted in widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally accusing police, election observers and city councillors of ignoring evidence of voter fraud based on "ethnic and religious sensitivities".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barricades outside polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an ID card to prove their identity at elections.
At this time, all a voter has to do is state his name and address.
The report suggests that non-removable ink be applied to a person's finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
The Commission is also proposing a number of amendments to the directive.
He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community in a cynical manner" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a vote-taking simulation where one person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarmed by the fraudulent mail-in ballot, in which senior members of the Muslim community pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including keeping IDs to prove identity
His report states: "Evidence has been presented that pressure was put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... government institutions had deliberately ignored such behavior because of 'politically correct' over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing mail-order records to stop "voters".
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for their ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once they have voted to prevent someone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic mail-in.
Prohibiting political activists from editing complete mail ballots and envelopes of mail ballots.
To give the police the power to set up roadblocks around polling stations.
A change in the law to facilitate a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
No photographs allowed in polling stations.
Requirement that English only may be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Increase training to ensure staff uphold the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls for the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal complaint has been made after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court has disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices", he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds of sufficiency, in accordance with the high standards of criminal procedure.
He also criticises the ineffective "acquisition controls" of the voter registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets court judgment was a wake-up call.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens that good reputation.
Mad about Kate's cycling double and other famous double of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics were stunned this week to learn of French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be an impressive double for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-striking athlete this summer to have his own famous doppelganger - at least not if social media is to be believed.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces currently flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison, left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, a lot of people on the Internet have pointed out how a certain archer might be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a furore on Twitter after images emerged of him looking eerily like the Wolf of Wall Street star.
In fact, the archer got the craze on social media, admitting that he's been told since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much of a resemblance myself, except for the facial hair", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment".
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be in the spotlight this year: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is set to appear as a double for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step up: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic" version of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair of actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been described by fans as "an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: one Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
One Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical".
In fact, U.S. soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medalist in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star's Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonalds analysis of the fourth-place finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the 4x200m freestyle relay, outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has apologized after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went down like a mule" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinion at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swim.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add color, was heard to say: "That little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost her touch, baby".
Too excited, went off like a bitch, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the swimming relay 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air".
China's Ai Yanhan was described in the women's 4 x 200m freestyle final as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost the connection, baby".
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, with many calling him a
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald, I'm going to be a writer for a while".
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #angeekelt.
Shortly afterward, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance".
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry it happened".
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to the people who responded to the tweet.
Commentator Scott Russell was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and pasted his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The network also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on air and our social media followers last night.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her as a person.
But they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming event on the CBC Olympics", he said.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not her as a person".
Of course, no disrespect was intended, and I am very sorry".
Shoppers in Primark are outraged by a woman trying on shameless underwear in the middle of a store.
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try on underpants.
To make matters worse, she sampled what she looked like in it, pulled it out, and put it back on the shelf.
She kept pushing and tried on four pairs of underpants at a store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underwear before putting it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mystery woman tried on the underwear, "she got dressed and left the store without buying anything".
She said, "People couldn't believe what they were seeing".
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own tights and trousers, and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, as cheeky as Oscar".
"Everyone stared as she took off her underwear, which she clearly didn't like, as she put it back on the shelf".
She repeated the same with three more panties before finally deciding she didn't like it, put on her clothes again and walked out.
"She didn't seem to mind being watched - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she had tried on".
Mrs. Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that were worn by another person and not washed".
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson added: 'As I have heard, the staff tried to withdraw the clothes from the sale after she left - which is just as well.'
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had them on and then took them off and they weren't washed".
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident which occurred at our Folkstone branch on Tuesday 9 August".
All products concerned have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself Against Gun Attacks With Krav Maga
The world out there is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a little bit safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grand master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your predator.
If you are approached from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire", says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
Then you hit him with your knee on the groin and twist while the attacker is writhing in pain, the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with the cane and move backwards while you point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon, and twist it so the attacker can't fire.
Simultaneously shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the assailant in the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backward and pointing the weapon at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly what Mizrachi is up to.
But remember, in a robbery, the safest way to hand over your money is to hand it over unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright scratches his tongue in Europe's dirtiest places for a travel guide
A British traveler put his immune system and gag reflex to the test by blowing up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scratched his train on a euro banknote, a rail in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was about to do.
But the experiment, which was filmed as "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", revealed some surprising results.
The thought of licking the flush button of a train toilet that has been used by thousands of others may seem repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railway station railings to toilet flushes, the task definitely put his immune system to the test
In the film, he said, "Even as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, dirt, worms and muddy water".
He certainly lived up to his reputation in the movie.
The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His test stroke showed a luminometer reading of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers in freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick, after its luminometer count was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands had a count of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in various places, such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "That's about the worst thing I've ever smelled in a bathroom".
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna eat anything in here because it's disgusting in here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy product manufacturer Valio.
The company supplies Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to help promote gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories at Valio Venice, says: 'We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that's fascinating to watch and explains the benefits of probiotics.
We'd have crazy brainstorming sessions that ended with us saying, "Let's call Ian".
They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
So instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context -- the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film".
Of course, there were things that were easier to get Ian to lick her and others that were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of these filthy treats on film".
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with gut health in particular, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria attached to them.
Social housing in Saltash, Cornwall destroyed by eviction
An unsociable family left their social housing after a delogement with £50,000 worth of damage because they had terrorized their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing cooperative employees found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls were full of gaping holes, wooden beams were torn up, trash was strewn on the floor, and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is believed that she now lives in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the housing authority at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned that the apartment was beyond repair.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I believe that people don't have to live that way.
There's a lot to consider, as this property is likely to be seen as a less than beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the interim, and police said the terror inflicted on the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of neighbors, drug abuse, drug dealing, and excessive yelling, fighting, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was issued a restraining order in June for anti-social behaviour.
In some rooms of the building that may be demolished, old garbage was found
The wooden planks were torn up on the property where drugs were traded in the past.
Neighbors testified that they saw them fighting in the street and regularly had to call the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended 11 week period to voluntarily move out.
The deportation was cheered on by neighbors who were relieved to say that their lives had been made hell.
One said: "They didn't care about anyone".
We lived next door for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we tell the police here is unbelievable.
"We couldn't sleep this morning".
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, testified that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, where the police were called at regular intervals
On the overgrown side of the community hall, trash and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to take full responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, as eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terribly visible to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community have done to come forward and give us the information.
I hope this development will bring some comfort to some of your neighbors and send a message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress, which was left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the
Housekeeping workers will now have to clear out piles of trash surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug with intent to distribute.
She claimed the money was for a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being left homeless, it is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
The police say they're going to evict tenants who don't follow house rules.
Devon and Cornwall Police's Angela Crow said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who do not abide by the house rules.
"This is for those who think they can behave without self-reproach and for those who have been harmed by such behaviour", she said.
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a low-flying military jet flies over a beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of a lifetime
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force plane has made an incredible crash.
The Air Force stated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when terrified tourists began to panic after a low-flying jet crashed over a crowded beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost in the eye over the sun-worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming at them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media, said: "It flew past twice really very low and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, and had to fly so low that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility from nearby fires, but the Air Force insisted that safety was not at any time threatened.
This summer, wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal, including the death of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - that his vision was limited
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Barca worried about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight on Sunday for the first step towards winning the first title in the new football season.
The Catalans will face FC Sevilla in the Spanish Super Cup away, with the second leg to be played three days later at the Camp Nou.
The double winner will have to compete against the second-placed finalist and reigning Europa League champion, among others, Neymar, who will be playing in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
The goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament injury in his knee during training, which has settled the Barca entry question in favour of Claudio Bravo, at least for now.
The Chilean international and Ter Stegen have been competing for the number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refrained from making a clear decision in this regard and has left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applicants.
Before the first match of the new season, the Spanish champions are doubting the fitness of the team, which was beaten 0-4 by Liverpool in a test match on Saturday.
Even in the 3-2 draw against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convincing.
The European Super Cup was won by Real Madrid, who beat Sevilla 3-2 after extra time, and they are looking for their second Super Cup victory.
Barcelona are the record winners in this competition with eleven victories so far.
Ma Long in a league of her own to ping-pong gold
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic champion in table tennis.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12, 5, 4, 4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
With this, the world number one won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and the Olympics.
Bronze went to Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final, as expected, and won the title.
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the singles title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese to climb the top Olympic ladder was former SVS-NÖ legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left to their own devices, with no coaches between sets and at time-outs.
They had retreated to the bleachers, leaving their proteges to fight each other in fair competition.
"I've played for my country so far".
"In the final, I'm playing for myself", Zhang had said, logically.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma only really had to fight his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the plate, leaving Zhang with a total of 13 points.
Ma's superiority did not produce the thrilling match expected.
But there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov by 4-1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarterfinal against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to be "ultimately" satisfied with tin.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic quarter-finals at a similarly high age.
Donald Trump admits to 'huge problems' in the campaign
The U.S. Republican leadership is plagued by massive concerns about losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted to weaknesses in his campaign in the hitherto Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally pompous and self-assured multi-millionaire voiced something like concern, as correspondents reported.
After he has knocked out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts are growing about his success in the race for the White House.
"We have a huge problem in Utah", Trump told evangelicals, who he asked to be supported in key states like Ohio, Florida and Virginia.
He said that the fault was false reports about his candidacy, and he took up his familiar media scolding again.
The Republican strongholds are shaking
Utah is usually a safe seat for Republicans.
A survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June found that Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were on an equal footing.
Other institutes are ahead of Trump, but not with the margin of victory that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he would stop Clinton's advance: "Just like I've done before".
And he said, "This is either going to be successful, or I'm going to have a very, very nice, long vacation".
He does nothing but "tell the truth".
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
Then I'll go back to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump's party has threatened to cut off funding to his campaign if he fails to improve his poll numbers.
Instead, they want to embrace the Republican candidates for Congress more strongly.
Olympic: Boldly cheating at doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenyan athletes are in danger of being sent home after the second doping incident at the Rio Olympics.
After a failed doping test in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that former sprinter and current coach John Anzrah had submitted a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenyan team leader by the doping controllers.
The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information on the case to launch its own investigation, an IAAF spokesman said.
'Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent action of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment,' said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and gave himself as Ferguson Rotich, handed over the sample and signed", explained Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was the 2015 World Champion in the 800 metres.
Four days earlier, Kenyan track and field delegation leader Michael Rotich had been pulled from the Rio Games.
He is accused of having informed athletes in his country of upcoming doping tests in exchange for money.
Media reports say he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under the IOC's special watch for some time, following numerous doping offences.
The announcement of the IOC's more than 2,000 targeted doping checks ahead of the Rio Games unusually noted that athletes from Kenya and Russia were being targeted in particular.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed just weeks before the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from its list of countries whose anti-doping policies comply with WADA's rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's lightweight athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
A series of ARD television reports have repeatedly alleged that in Kenya, doping agents are readily available and that there is a significant sports betting mentality.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for an investigation in Kenya similar to the one he had in Russian athletics.
The results of the study showed that doping was widespread and systematic in this sport.
Russia's track and field athletes were subsequently banned from the summer games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli and the other
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg Festival presents "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli in the mix.
A musical is taking over Salzburg: the "West Side Story", the masterpiece of Leonard Bernstein.
The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youthful dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, raves: "This music is full of rhythm".
We always say that it's very Latin.
There's a lot of Latin stuff in their rhythm and their melody.
It's a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an aged Maria.
She recalls with sadness her love affair with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
I've always been fascinated by the role of Mary.
First, because she's exceptionally musical!
And then there's Maria's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, she's also naive, of course, and very passionate.
"She's very much like me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman", Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist".
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
He's a man who needs to conduct.
You can see it in his every move, in his eyes, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that's very important!
For American director Philip W. McKinley, "West Side Story" is a timely work: "This play is about prejudice and bigotry".
Today we have the refugees, back then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
It is the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIL was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing about it is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to deter people from ever making that decision", Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then boarded a bus bound for the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months, she was a widow.
Reid says Clinton will stay on as a Supreme Court candidate in case Garland wins.
Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to pick Garland "with a degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't be concerned with unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were lackeys and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found Donald Trump unfit for the presidency.
Treats wants a nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats editor Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does, too.
"We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar's release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan will be sitting on packed suitcases", says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Dialogue and World Foundation, a foundation close to Gülen.
The Kurdish community in Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even reach "several hundred thousand", believes the association's chairman, Ali Toprak.
Because of the harsh measures taken by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup, the Kurdish community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands of asylum seekers from Turkey to be in Germany, and in the medium term, a few hundred thousand, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition", says the association's chairman Ali Toprak in the "Welt" newspaper on Friday.
The government has been overwhelming Kurdish strongholds with punitive measures for months, and 500,000 Kurds are on the run inside Turkey.
After the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It is not possible for a state that takes in refugees to produce refugees in its own country", said Toprak.
The head of the association deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish cities, but also in Alevi cities.
The European Union has a duty to ensure that the European Union is able to take all the necessary steps to ensure that the rights of the child are fully respected.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or driven out in the last hundred years", said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the German government "take a position as strong as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" is being conducted against Erdogan critics.
For the first time in months, I don't feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The brand as a follower of Gülen destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, and by the way, the Kemalists and secularists are also sitting on packed suitcases", said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Dialogue and Education Foundation, the "World".
The newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, that even before the coup, Turks were the largest group of persons granted asylum in Germany because of political persecution.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should be able to take decisions on the basis of the recommendations of the European Parliament and the Council.
This survey does not include those who have fled from war, poverty or lack of prospects.
The right to asylum is granted by the Constitution only to those who are politically, that is to say, individually persecuted by the State.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "I will go where it hurts"
Seltsames Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals are not informed of the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood the meaning.
In 2021, the state parliamentary election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's the only thing that's ever been so stupid: summer holidays, heat and the state election campaign - that's all.
The locals who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not natives, so they cannot vote for the state parliament.
The problem is that the number of votes cast is not sufficient to cover the cost of the holidays.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the election campaign pass by the people.
The hot phase, if you can even say that, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in the polls.
It's going to be interesting to see how much the new AfD cuts and what is left in the end that is good for the coalition.
Sellering, 66, who has been in power since 2008, is running an almost unremarkable campaign, as can be seen from his large posters.
He travels the country, handing out roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary, word-saving predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the rise of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, your "we can do it" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him his beautiful office.
The CDU, with its leading candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced campaigning in the wrong place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalians, Berliners and Saxons than Mecklenburgers and Vorpommerners.
"There was probably a majority from other German states", complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.
But it is not a pity for anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely avoids the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, is only a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that the basis of the country is being eroded, and that it must make a great effort to find a connection with the people again.
You are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vast country.
The advice of the CDU candidate to his fellow candidates is also self-explanatory: "You have to go where it hurts, which is where people are: village horses, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
With much at stake, Sellering has called for his SPD to campaign with particular commitment.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last behind their partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 elections, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a minor party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap to the state legislature.
They're turning the holiday slump into a modern virtue, and they're moving their campaign, much of it, to the Internet.
"Online campaigning", as the state chairwoman Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners will be looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is now cruising through the Mecklenburg Lakes in a houseboat and she also thinks it's beautiful.
Their impression: "Voting leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27-Rehabilitation: restaurants are suffering from closure
The speed with which the B27 is being repaired is nothing to complain about.
The construction workers, who start at 5:30 a.m. and finish at about 8 p.m., are being praised.
"They made everything very messy", says Elvira Tetzlaff, who works at the jet-tank station.
This is a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site was moved south at the beginning of the week, as planned, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
The work of the project team is also commended, for example in the provision of emergency vehicles.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blockade of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg was restored, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
The citizens can now use the B27 from Ofterdingen in both directions.
The bypass traffic in the town seems to be decreasing.
"There were some substantial complaints", says Florian King, deputy head of the department responsible for traffic management.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to deal with more traffic noise, because many people were looking for a shortcut and trusted their Navi rather than the signage.
Which caused some trucks to crash into residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not respected, the municipality requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There was a lot of overstepping", says King, who was himself on the ground to assess the situation.
Two or three have been struck every minute.
The fastest was in the 30 speed zone at 50 miles per hour.
But since the construction site has moved, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen on the B27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.
Businessmen don't like to look at cards.
But the fact that the B27 recovery has led to a decline in their sales is obvious to anyone who asks.
However, some are affected more than others.
The restructuring will have little effect on those who have less to do with the "final customer", i.e. who produce for other companies.
Thomas Sulz also spoke of a "slight decline" at the Maier car dealership, but also admitted that, of course, "the regular customers are missing".
The most affected are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds words clear.
It's already existential.
Not only him, but all the restaurants were "hit hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro of turnover.
He estimates the loss in sales to be "well over 50 percent".
The road improvements "threw his business back two years".
He had to lay off half his staff.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them were fired, the policy would have been different.
Instead, the Prime Minister, Jörg Schmidt, responded to a question from Göhner about whether there could be financial compensation by stating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on B 27.
Göhner knows of other counties where such a thing has been handled more generously.
Göhner is confident that his restaurant will survive.
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, he points out.
He can understand that other regulars are now less likely to stop by because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner is certain that his regular customers will return after the renovation work is completed.
Despite the BSE and avian flu crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's rough.
There are laws being twisted all the time in the name of fighting terrorism.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the European Union is able to meet the challenges of the present crisis.
But what does a conditional status have to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maiziere is giving the reconciliation.
The German Interior Minister said that all his proposals were "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, when he presented his new security package.
They're not overwhelming anyone.
Other, more advanced points would be discussed first within the parties.
I'm in on it, too.
The Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the directive to include the whole of the EU would be a very good idea.
De Maizière has allowed some time to pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The Commission's proposal is therefore a good one.
The fact that a new security authority is to be set up to deal with the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun rights.
The call for more video surveillance and staffing for the security agencies is also not surprising.
The Commission is also proposing to make a new law on the protection of the environment, which will be introduced in the next few years.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD", the CDU man admits.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should be consulted on the draft budget.
Some new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
The Commission is therefore proposing to amend the directive to make it more effective.
Refugees who are brought into the country on a targeted basis are required to have their smartphones checked and social media accounts exposed for security screening.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be given the right to decide on the application of the directive.
Some of it is politically and legally sensitive.
Some of them are still raw and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, the unequal treatment of those who are tolerated - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Also, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that people care about deeply could not be left out of the campaign.
Internal security has become a huge focus.
First, the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections coming up.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on the subject of internal security.
The past few days have been very hectic between the two parties.
First, a bitter dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then over a security policy meeting of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of departments also demand a ban on the burqa and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maiziere is also struggling to find a way to reconcile.
He doesn't care about a double-pass.
We have settled the debate in Germany.
There's no point in reopening them.
And he has constitutional concerns about a burka ban.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all respects and whether it is actually "comprehensible" to the coalition partner remains to be seen.
There's a lot of stuff in there that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also trying to make a name for itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel is cautiously signaling a willingness to talk, saying: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still coming through.
Despite the diesel scandal, the number of deliveries worldwide is increasing.
But not all markets are.
There's a buzz about a term in the recall.
Volkswagen is slowing down in deliveries in the second half of the year.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given the task of developing a common policy on the environment.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened, particularly in Western Europe, and thus again weighed down on overall sales, as the Dax company reported.
The Volkswagen brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July than in the same month of the previous year, with 449,100 cars.
In Western Europe alone, the second largest market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than in the same month last year.
In the domestic market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker July figures mainly to two days of sales in Europe.
In addition, some core markets were reluctant to buy because of 'changed economic conditions'.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system for the exchange of information on the EU's external borders.
The United States, where the emissions issue first escalated, is also facing a further downturn.
The Chinese market is a big support for VW.
The main domestic brand in Lower Saxony, however, is still affected by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, there is only a total delivery loss of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Fred Kappler, head of sales, continued to show a sales surplus from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in that period, or 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated emissions tests with software.
In Germany alone, VW is recalling some 2.5 million cars for conversion.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars would not have any negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer issues a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as was said in business circles on Friday.
The reason is legal.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen was now giving its German customers a warranty on converted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The transport department confirmed that this meeting took place.
'VW must fully comply with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA.'
"Divisions from this will not be accepted", said the Federal Minister of Transport, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has taken the responsibility for ensuring that no deterioration occurs in terms of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all vehicle type approval values are unchanged.
The Commission has not yet taken up the matter of the guarantee, but it is not yet known whether the guarantee is in fact a guarantee.
The broad term 'guarantee' is used to describe the possibility that customers might come to a workshop six months after the conversion with an engine failure, for example, and attribute this to the new software, even if the failure is unrelated.
It was also important in the interests of the customers to avoid any uncertainty about possible warranty schemes in the event of other damages that had nothing to do with the emissions scandal.
That's why VW doesn't use the word "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is the second largest bank in Germany to charge penalty interest to wealthy savers.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "We are only talking about 139 customers who have put 40 million euros into current or day-to-day accounts".
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an isolated case and sees no signal in it: ordinary savers would "not have to fear paying penalty interest on their savings".
If banks deposit money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay its 0.4 per cent penalty rate.
The fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards to private and corporate customers for deposits of more than EUR 100 000 in current or day-to-day accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free".
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future", said Paul.
He has been holding 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"They are in my central bank account and they cause 0.4 percent of the cost", said the head of the bank.
"I can't put in $4,000 for every million".
The costs are now passed on according to the principle of the originator.
It would be far too dangerous to leave the cash in the vaults of Raiffeisenbank: "I've already been robbed four times, I don't want a fifth!" said the bank's executive.
Most of the customers would understand and switch to other investment forms.
Only a few have gone to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association stated: 'The extreme monetary policy of the ECB is causing significant costs for all banks'.
The Commission's proposal for a directive was to be adopted by the Council on 1 January.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or bank transfers.
With penalty interest on deposits of three million euros and above, the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines in 2014 with its Skatbank branch.
Michael Kemmer, CEO of the Bankenverband, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay a blanket fee for deposits, as the competition in Germany between banks and savings banks is far too strong".
A banker said that there was "a clientele on Lake Tegernsee that was a little more lavishly endowed with wealth".
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if it stores money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to famous actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs.
The cooperative association "is not aware of any other banks currently charging a deposit repayment for deposits from private customers", said Ernst.
The President of the Federation of German Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had stated at the end of June: "The threshold for going negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition was fierce and there was a risk of investors leaving to compete.
The German customers will not like this in the broad.
Destination Records: who is buying records?
Lonely middle-aged men like to play records.
Before you rush to the comment section to smear him with crude insults under the pseudonym NotEveryoneSingleMenInTheMiddleAge, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about resurgence of recording is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical items, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely to buy.
It's not just a hobbyist's horde either - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the YouGov results right?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest gray suit and strutting wildly, before stopping, holding my hands and saying something definitive like, "Well, let's take a closer look at this".
So let's take a look at this.
Although the heart of Soho is losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings once occupied by independent vendors - there are still a handful of fantastic specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I'm standing in close proximity to various men in such shops, trying to gauge their age and mood by observation.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I've been following from Sister Ray (data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s), is in London for a day of meetings and is going through the shops to fill in the hours.
I ask, is he a collector?
"I guess so", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he e-mailed me the snapshot, I did not follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they were released and to buy back items that he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the stuff I buy is from the late '60s, early '70s, that came out when I was 11 or 12, stuff that I was probably a little too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouGov profile.
But he's also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media, people who've heard about the comeback and are motivated to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I've had, people have typically gotten rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
"Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records", he says.
That would explain the boom in record revivalists of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that evoke happy memories of youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as a kind of comfort", says Wez.
That's the way it is for me as a collector, and I think it's the way it is for a lot of people.
It's a simple way to keep yourself occupied.
"We're like your social workers!" a social worker gushes from a stack of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% of those who own a turntable never use it, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I'm flipping through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Somebody came in here recently and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a huge percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-oriented, less music-oriented.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
These are younger people, not older people, who are just slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has almost a whole floor devoted to the records, has a more colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the shops mentioned above - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop pop buzzing from the speakers instead of experimental jazz - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them look lonely, but psychological trauma can be hard to detect if you've been standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more interested in window shopping than in big purchases.
She doesn't make much, so collecting records isn't really an option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is"... she whispers with a loving sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that's said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm pretending to be sampling the jeans-hotpants, I'm watching a group of young teenage girls group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high that it is impossible to touch them.
It's just record art.
But considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about.
It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like records.
And while my research found that YouGov's findings are true, at least in record stores in Soho, they don't take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly won't spend their Thursday morning wandering through the record shops of Berwick Street and flipping through records while avoiding the staring stare of a creepy, 30-year-old fake presenter who's standing over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - Video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the record was held by a female, who is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to close 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and poses a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They further argued that the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 makeshift shops, but conceded that the prefecture of Calais's concerns were "absolutely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who are "living in extremely precarious conditions".
He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites threatened with demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, which is a non-profit that provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and an asylum counseling center for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to save the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said that the closure would be "a catastrophe for these children, the youngest of whom is eight years old".
Two aid organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin remains a fighter
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, pro cyclist Tony Martin is determined not to be undermined.
"I will keep my eyes on the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting", the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place in the sugar hat.
"I find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial", Martin said.
He should analyze calmly the reasons that led to the debacle.
At the time trial world championship in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I'm going to take a hard look at everything that we've changed in the last time".
"My position is also included", wrote the three-time world time trial champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday for the 54.5 km.
Olympic tennis pro Siegemund misses the semifinals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The world ranking 32 from Metzingen missed by a 1: 6, 1: 6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico / WTA-Nr.
The semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who suffered from back problems, could only make her serve once and appeared powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hopeful Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the qualifying round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of the Summer Games had last been in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
The Group is increasing its start-up for live video game broadcasting
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend -- and Microsoft wants to capitalize on it.
The tech giant is buying the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft did not disclose the amount of money involved in the acquisition on Thursday.
Beam launched its service in January and has already reached more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene.
For example, they can give players missions and confront enemies, as well as provide equipment.
The gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of esports.
Facebook is supposed to help you on your way to becoming a global media event.
The advertising industry is already booming.
The startup, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington, will move to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi said.
The acquisition should therefore not change anything for the customers.
Beam is being integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms include Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube gaming is part of the mother of Google Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany's railway companies must adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In several German states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flashing devices are being tested, which are intended to transmit speedometers particularly effectively.
The future-looking enforcement trailers from the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, in accident hotspots where it would be too dangerous for a mobile police measurement.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with temporary speed limit often there is no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flash.
But a permanent mobile structure may be too dangerous or too expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days on continuous measurement, and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measurement technology also allows all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple lanes.
Variable speed limits and time, lane and vehicle class restrictions can also be monitored.
In the high-speed condition, the trailer can be moved with any car with trailer coupling, according to the manufacturer.
To prevent it from being stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, bulletproof outer casing.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various German states since 2015 and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also thrilled with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 units, after ordering 150 units last year.
Great Britain takes silver in 7s Rugby after Fiji take gold in Masterclass
Britain's impressive performance in Rugby 7 came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday night when they were beaten 43-7 by Fiji in the final at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji put together a master class of handling, side-stepping, back-stroke, line-running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-so-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on the day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Box's 7-5 semifinal loss on the same day could fall to them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best possible way in this format.
It might be a consolation to GB - but it probably won't be - that at least one Brit will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
GB has had a difficult journey.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one.
This flap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started out beautifully and let the GBs' attacks bounce off of fun.
It felt like a race in a moving bus for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. The World Series winners were up 5-0 as Osea Kolinisau lurched into the corner.
With four minutes left in the game, Jerry Tuwai added another right-handed attack that he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A stunning tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua in the right corner scored a touchdown and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the resumption and there was still over a minute of play... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pushed through another weak tackle by the GB team and stormed to the line to score a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 run to the break.
It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while Britain is still learning.
It is.
GB made some fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap... for a full four minutes, which was good for the first-half odds until Josua Tuisova passed after a brilliant intermission from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, scoring a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long gone in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the bleachers.
It was not hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-spoon with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle blew, the Fijians embraced, and GB kicked the grass.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals and Great Britain had forced South Africa out of the race in a close semi-final match - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown took the boxes to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the win - and the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win by their coach's battle with cancer
There's not gonna be any more gold in the world than there was in these games, and that's gonna mean something.
From the first oar to the last, 220 hard hits that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was just the two of them at the helm, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams, who was all over the place as they rowed to their second consecutive Olympic gold in pairs without a helmswoman, the first women in British sporting history to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, their 39th undefeated effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of triumph at all.
Behind every gold in the rough is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and none more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he would live to see the day he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that was operable, and they did.
If you don't, it'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate to be able to begin treatment early in 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that's even the right term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was a motivation.
I was in the hospital, running around the ward -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would do it.
That's how it starts.
Rowing is a challenge in itself, but that makes it even more challenging.
In the immediate aftermath of the victory, her first thoughts were of Williams, who had spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a tour in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week.
It just goes back to how much this means to me, how much me and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
We'd be nothing without Robin, so a massive thank you to him.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not match.
Even in the last 500 metres, as the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren't looking to do anything great.
We didn't want any fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding of her own next week with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took me six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better", she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The director of the water company Veitensteingruppe, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water utility as a model for the large water producers.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used in a proper manner.
Shortly afterwards, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was an employee of the association for 31 years, 28 of them as director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water industry association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, supplies about 150000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of the district are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
Other towns and municipalities have water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Gertrud Bühl (FW), Mayor of Breitbrunn, recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water inspector in 1985 and was appointed as the general manager of the association in 1988.
"His responsibilities have been very varied, ranging from water piping construction and maintenance work, to office and organisational work, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions, and emergency operations on weekends", said the chairwoman.
She highlighted the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land for the new wells (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of the reservoirs (1999), the new purchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.
There was no standstill and innovation was constantly introduced, because water is life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked hard for his water charity and he has lived the charity as if it were his own business.
A few weeks ago, he was able to present the successful concept of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction to the water forum of the district of Unterfranken as a real practitioner.
For this he received much recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised the waterman Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water boy in the world, and he was a loyal servant.
Together, we were an unbeatable team.
He described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the association as highlights from his point of view.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the breaking of the pipe at the reservoir near Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, they had to work all night long to provide the villages with water.
The only way to maintain the supply of Neubrunn was to fill the high-pressure vessel from Pettstadt with pipes.
The management of the association for drinking water was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeded Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism - and to other parents who are affected: "You have to have the courage to talk about it".
"Medicine has made great progress", the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she thought she was going to die.
But Tiago, now eight years old, had made good progress and was now attending private school in New York, where the best therapists were.
"For example, if I ask him about something that happened two years ago when I sang at the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything", said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago is from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship in a barge marriage - Husband shoots his partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner and fatally injured her at around 10.45am in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) on Friday.
"The man himself called us and said he had shot his partner", said a police spokeswoman.
The perpetrator is on the run, and he's being publicly sought.
Now it's all over the country, because Sven S. might be driving.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, brown-brown, and bald.
Meanwhile, the police released a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a bald head.
The man is not to be addressed directly.
He could still be carrying the gun, according to the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110!
The police are talking about a "relationship state".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially refused to give any details about the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but confirmed that a man had been killed.
"This is a homicide".
"We cannot say more at the moment", said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special operations command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - A vision for the German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs in the millions.
The financial burden that the industry was facing from the promotion of green electricity is off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy levy remains in place for the existing plants producing so-called own electricity in the German steel industry, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the West German General Zeitung (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations, we have finally reached this agreement".
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to pay.
The German steel industry is facing additional costs of between 120 and 240 million euros per year, according to the German Association of the Steel Industry.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a memorandum of understanding with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steelworks are replaced does an EEG surcharge of 20% come into play.
But neither is it levied in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the EU Commission on the own generation of electricity.
This largely establishes the status quo of the existing system.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the Council in the form of a proposal for a regulation.
"This is the first step in our 'Steel is the Future' campaign".
"More must follow".
"Climate and employment targets also need to be balanced in the reform of the emissions trading system", said Jörg Hofmann, IG Metall's CEO, in Frankfurt.
The Commission has also examined the impact of the measures on the Union industry.
The situation worsened last year when China, the world's largest producer, launched a massive steel rush to the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel groups of dumping prices.
The situation has somewhat eased over the course of this spring.
On the one hand, import duties on imported steel are having an effect, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industrial giant Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last time prices had stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation by further cutting costs.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out the closure of individual plants.
The German steel industry employed around 86000 people at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
The steel industry produced 3.4 million tonnes of crude steel, a drop of more than 6% on the previous month, the German Steel Industry Association said on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced decreased for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been down two percent from the previous year.
The association expects to increase output in the coming months, thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, spirit, health: singing is good for the elderly
As a young girl, she was a member of the school choir, studied music at the teacher training college, and now at the age of 78, she sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me emotionally and physically", she says.
After a rehearsal, she says she feels balanced, cheerful, and more alive overall.
Besides, it does something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler says.
Regular social interaction allows older people to establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve with age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This is the experience of Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To be able to separate and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness".
Singing can be a positive strain, says Hackler.
Because seniors are practicing deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly exercise your lungs, you won't be able to breathe as easily in everyday life.
Even if it's about keeping your voice sounding in old age, singing is a great hobby.
Singing often has a special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the German Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs evokes many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Even people with dementia recall events that happened long ago through song lyrics and especially melodies.
Singing also requires a special performance of the head, explains Lenz.
Focusing on your own voice and on a given rhythm at the same time and trying to match the other singers is a great cognitive challenge.
Older people living alone, in particular, practice not focusing only on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition one gets from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
A thrilled audience is great praise.
Singing in the choir also increases your self-esteem.
Showing Yourself: When I practice for something for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens me.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Lenz advises that anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he feels that he has little talent.
You can't sing alone. With 50 people singing, who can hear if a note goes wrong?
Hackler says that there are several ways for seniors to find the right offer.
When someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can just join in.
Many towns also have a view of the surrounding choirs.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church president directly.
Many senior choirs are also available on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbours to help you with your Internet search.
If you want to sing, you should join a choir, Hack Radler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this is true for any age.
Cats are more sensitive than kittens to the cries of their young
Biologists in Hanover have studied the effect of the cries of kittens on adult animals.
To their surprise, the male's meowing did not leave them cold either - but unlike the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can detect the degree of excitement of kittens by the meow of the young.
They are 10 percent more responsive to sounds made by kittens who feel in dire need, scientists at the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) have found.
Cats respond to the cries of kittens, but they always do so in the same way.
"It seems that the differences in sound between the meow of young animals that are less excited and those that are more excited are either not perceptible or not significant to the males", said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the team had already found that the duration and pitch of kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
For one thing, they were given the sounds of babies being taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
Second, they were confronted with the cries of more excited kittens, who were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their findings to be significant despite the small sample size.
"All the females, even those who had not yet had offspring of their own, reacted differently to the screams", Konerding said.
They turned faster to the loudspeaker when this call of the very excited kitten played.
This ability may be inborn or may develop with sexual maturity.
"It was surprising that the males responded at all", said the biologist.
Scientists have repeatedly studied the human response of women and men to baby noises.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski is going for the Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued for former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football match is being held in Turkey.
The official line is clear: "business as usual" is needed.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempted coup in July, the government insisted that the daily lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
This does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt.
And they don't stop for football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant for former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
Accordingly, Sükür, who is now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
The state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, will last until October, but it will have virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
Erdogan declared the end of nightly "democracy guards" in public squares across the country on Wednesday.
The sport, like the country, is divided between supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Besiktas's fans are not traditionally among the president's friends.
The Turkish people are united by their strong rejection of military coups in the face of dramatic historical events.
Even the fans agree - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
The winner of the cup, Gala, will be decided by Lukas Podolski.
The 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions.
In the final against Fenerbahce, he scored the winning goal.
The newspaper "Fanatik" hailed him as "the best on the field".
He finished the season in a great way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record-holder ended in a reconciliatory way.
After a first-round knockout in the Champions League, the Lions also took an early exit in the Europa League.
In the Super League, it only reached sixth place.
The season hasn't been good.
The Cup was the only way to win something.
"We did it, and that's the most important thing", Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the playing year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 saves as the Super League's top scorer, laid the foundation for the 14th title.
That's why fans are still hoping for the 31-year-old's return.
The club's coach, who was under contract with AC Florenz and only loaned to Besiktas, announced after the coup attempt that he would not return after his Euro-cup holiday due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, all he has to do is say so", said club manager Fikret Orman, quoted by the magazine Kicker.
The striker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary, which is estimated at €7.5 million, Orman said, adding: "We cannot pay his salary at Florenz".
Despite doping, these athletes still have a chance to win medals at the Rio Olympics
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to race in Rio.
Other overweight athletes can laugh at this - they're fighting for medals in Rio.
The issue of doping continues to dominate the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had been banned from competing just before the Olympics for doping, was mercilessly whipped and booed during her 100 meter breaststroke.
A bizarre scene was in store: With a smile on her face, she had been boasting in the hall and had provoked with her performance.
When it was determined that she would not get gold, the audience erupted in cheers.
But there are many more athletes who are competing in the Rio Olympics despite their doping history.
Here 's a rundown of the results .
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He's been suspended twice for doping, in 2001 and 2006 to 2010.
Since his ban the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion runs even faster than before, he is the world number one in the 100 meters in 9.80 seconds and is considered the greatest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion was banned for six months in 2010 after testing positive for the painkiller Oxycodone.
She had a toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, the 2013 World Champion, and the 2010-2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking the drug and was suspended for six months.
The four furthest-throwing rounds this year go to the big golden favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A penis enlargement device was responsible, Merritt claimed.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 meters.
Iwan Tichon (Hammer Throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has had so many medals subsequently stripped from him.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later after testing positive for testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the European Championship in 2006 for testosterone abuse.
The bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games, which was also revoked, was returned to him following a ruling by the International Court of Sport (CAS).
He is ranked second in the world at 80.04 m.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favourite tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to compete in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found to have taken a banned dietary supplement, the ban of the world anti-doping agency WADA fell mild and ended on July 13.
Bombing in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital but had already been able to leave.
She planned her trip home for early September.
The Commission is also aware that the Council has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the Schengen acquis to the territory of the Member States.
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities on this matter, Schnöll said.
Two bombs exploded in a shopping district in Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok, on Thursday evening.
The police said that one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians.
Two more explosions were detonated on Friday morning, killing another person, according to authorities.
There was a bomb explosion reported from Phuket this morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the blast near Patong, a popular beach for holidaymakers, according to police.
Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, killing a city employee.
The explosive device was detonated in a flower bed outside the Coast Guard station, authorities said.
Finally, explosions in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast have left several injured.
The report also mentions the possibility of a link with the Hua Hin explosions.
"The bombings have the same handwriting", Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters on Friday morning.
"We believe this was a coordinated attack".
It was too early to comment on possible motives, but it was likely to be the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks, typical of the bombings by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, confined to limited areas and provinces", said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is believed that the bombs were planted by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities have received intelligence information in recent days about imminent attacks in the south of the country, but they were not informed of the exact time and place.
It is not yet clear which group is behind the attacks.
Police have instructed officials across the country to increase security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are occasional small bombings, but they are not usually directed at tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bomb blasts, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (Security Level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and surrounding area.
Following clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, non-essential travel to these provinces is advised.
Increased security risk (Security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military a great deal of influence in the years to come.
Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombings were an attempt to create chaos as the country moved toward stability, economic recovery and tourism.
The military junta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, credits itself with restoring stability and order to the kingdom.
However, the military has also failed to contain the Muslim rebellion that has been raging for years in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Less than a year ago, an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "identitarian movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
The group has been placed under surveillance by the federal protectors of the constitution, according to several state agencies.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' evidence of efforts against the basic democratic order of freedom", Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of the Constitutional Protection Office, told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Immigrants of the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are thus defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement.
The Identitarian Movement is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural mania", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "loss of identity through alienation".
The "identitarians" are already being observed by the constitutional guards in nine German states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia.
Maaßen said his agency had worked closely with the provincial offices on the decision.
"Groups like the Identity Movement are trying to pick up their target group where they are", the head of the constitutional protection said.
Generally, extremists try to address them in youthful language, often with pop music.
Islamists would do that, as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a blatant promotion of the cause.
Propaganda is meant to appeal to people's emotions.
Young people are especially vulnerable.
This is dangerous.
Recently, there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "Identitarian" with AfD politicians.
Mr. Maassen said he had no knowledge of the matter.
The Commissioner pointed out that the Commission had not yet been able to establish a list of the Member States which had been involved in the infringement.
It depends on whether the party in question - in this case the AfD - is changed in its direction by certain people who are extremists and become so extremist.
The decisive factor is therefore whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This was not detectable.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the Old School Society group or the Freitaler group.
It is quite possible that other right-wing terrorist groups or small groups may be formed and may plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee shelters or other right-wing extremist motives.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the Council by 31 December.
The groups have been created at regional level or in social networks.
Maassen expressed concern that many of the attacks were against people who had not previously been seen in the right place.
That's what's worrying me.
Many of the suspects in the attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes who previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or who voted for the CDU, SPD or Left, but who have become radicalised by right-wing extremist sentiment".
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros's Habte is becoming an internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always make the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is evidenced by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily absent from the TV images.
It just disappeared, no matter how far the cutout was selected.
Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit on social networks.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished 48 seconds behind and 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was his not-so-sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still competing in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian has been given a special starting privilege by the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything, Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
Soon the first nicknames were making the rounds.
Some media outlets called him "the Robel of the whale".
In a "well-off-belly" style, the British tabloid The Sun made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, which was only one minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's run was the subject of media attention.
Unforgettable was the performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a preliminary 100 meter freestyle alone.
Moussambani was a frenetic fixture back then.
The then 22-year-old had only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never run such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop on Neuer Platz was robbed.
Police say the 67-year-old Gerets rider left her shop at about 5:30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at about 8:15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the register.
No trace of the perpetrator was found.
There's no video surveillance in the building.
Trump doesn't see the looming election defeat as so close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election of the US President fails, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November, he will not care: "Either it will work out or I will have a very, very nice, long vacation", said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, said Trump.
He described US President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as founders of the terrorist militia Islamic State (IS).
The opposition within his own party has been growing lately.
The postal service is entering the electric conveyor trade
An electric delivery vehicle of the German Post Office in action.
Other companies are clearly interested in the vessel.
The Post is also planning to sell its electric StreetScooter.
The company is planning to start trading in the transporter shortly.
The Post wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market from next year.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties", said a postal spokesman on Friday.
The company has been considering for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which is used to deliver letters and parcels, to other businesses.
Jürgen Gerdes, the post office's director, said there were always requests, from craftsmen, for example.
The Bonn-based company is planning to start mass producing the vehicles soon, according to the news magazine Der Spiegel.
In the post-production phase, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and that it would in the long term make a complete switch to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020", he said at the end of July.
I can see us converting the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its chief executive Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations were sudden, but not entirely surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the longer the successes promised by the CEO Matthias Hartmann were not achieved, the more uncertain the chair of the board would be.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After another disappointing turnover and the resignation of the company's management, the world's number five in the industry is facing a new beginning in terms of personnel.
GfK's CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of GfK, Arno Mahlert, will resign from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The company announced that Gerhard Hausruckinger, who was previously a member of the board, will take over as of 1 September.
He is to officially take over the function of "Board Speaker" until a successor to Hartmann is found.
The reason for the resignations was given by the company as "different views" on the long-term business policy.
A company spokesman declined to give details on Friday.
The future head of the market research company is not yet clear.
On Friday, investors said that shareholders had recently become disillusioned by the lack of success of the restructuring that had been initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the helm of GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are still not visible even after five years", it said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder is going to be worried at some point.
"If this was the case with BMW, the Quandts would do it too", it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss-making business in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in previous quarters.
At EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.
Compared with the first half of the year, turnover fell by 3.4 per cent to EUR 721.2 million.
The main factor affecting the profit in the second quarter was the decline in the company's value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The write-downs of EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience business area resulted in a loss of EUR 148,2 million for the group.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the parties to the transaction.
The Commission has also been asked to consider the possibility of a new directive on the protection of consumers' interests.
Eight people were injured in an accident involving a tourist bus with 43 elderly passengers in Krummhörn, Aurich district, on Thursday.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of a tourist bus from Eisenach had to dodge a truck that was travelling in the opposite direction.
The bus left the road on the right and slid into a ditch, a police spokeswoman told Aurich/Wittmund.
"Due to the location of the bus, the passengers were unable to leave the bus by themselves", she said.
The fire department released the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on State Road 2.
The uninjured travelers were taken by a regular bus back to the Krumhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
Investigators asked the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water will be EUR 3,44 as of 1 October 2016 for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl waste water treatment plant area instead of EUR 2,10 as of now; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp EUR 3,36 (previously EUR 2,26) and for Azendorf EUR 3,64 (previously EUR 2,18).
The Commission has already decided to increase the amount of the waste water charge for the Azendorf plant at the latest when appropriate improvements are needed.
The cost of waste water in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre, according to an overhead calculation.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the budget was approved by the Kulmbach County Council and it was found that these wastewater plants were under-covered.
The market was obliged by legal bases to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens and the businesses and industries of Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their wallets.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As Herbert Schmidt, the director of the administration, pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water installations of the market municipality was necessary.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not provided any evidence that the measures would be in line with the Union interest.
The reason given by Schmidt for the significant increases in fees is that all three waste water treatment plants are relatively small installations with a very low waste water consumption of between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
The low distribution base would, for example, have a serious impact on the cost of several thousand euros for necessary repairs.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, all three plants incurred significant renovation and repair costs, not least because of their age.
The Azendorf plant is almost 30 years old, the Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth plants and the Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp plants almost 20 years.
The Commission also noted that the measures in question were not intended to compensate for the costs of the project.
The Pumpwerk Welschenkahl had to completely overhaul the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems and the Lopp pond treatment plant had to dig out the first pond after almost 20 years of operation, dispose of the sludge and install an additional ventilation system in order to be able to comply with water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: 'These extraordinary expenses were supplemented by the costs of care and maintenance which are to be included in the new calculation period.'
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
The Commission's proposal is to establish a system of controls for the disposal of waste water in the three plants.
The Commission's proposal was to introduce a new system of taxation for the benefit of consumers.
The situation for the above-mentioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, according to Steinhäuser, especially since the supply area of the wastewater utility Friesenbachtal cannot be extended to include these plants because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July on a monthly basis.
This is the highest level (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when the figure was recorded as positive 0.2%.
The average annual inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0,8% as measured by the CPI.
The CPI in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0%, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0,2%.
In July 2016, the following groups of consumer goods increased in price compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat criticizes the "anime" effect as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identities in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, attribute-switching tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All wrongdoing is public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past, accused of promoting blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them squinting eyes, false teeth and bulging cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage went viral on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But to outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded them of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos went viral, said the filter was "hurtful and unpleasant to say the least".
She added that "it's hard to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-faced is drawn to the descending extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural barrier.
American culture seems to be in an endless battle for diversity and inclusion, from conference rooms to Hollywood to the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people -- who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts -- might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be", said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes the racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have diverse representation of people of other skin colour in their workforce so they can make those decisions", said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people of other skin colour working there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it".
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a human resources manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said for her part that she will be banned from her Snapchat account, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K".
Military leadership is falsifying ISIS intelligence, congressional committee finds
Military personnel from the United States Central Command altered intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigative committee reported Thursday.
The preliminary report, compiled by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Budget Committee, reports a great deal of dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how senior officers changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically gleaned from high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly painted a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and was consistently more positive than analysis by other intelligence services", a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders", noted Republican House member Ken Calvert.
The leadership failures in Centcom reach all the way to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
While it does not directly suggest that Obama administration officials gave orders to alter the reports, it does show how analysts felt pressured by their superiors to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements to Congress were significantly more positive than the facts", the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official publicly announced that a military takeover of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is clear", Mike Pompeo, the Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top brass of Central Command altered the intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force after they were tipped off that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report, published on Thursday, will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense are ongoing.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restrictive process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services", said senior Democrat on the committee, House of Representatives member Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the release of intelligence reports", damaged analysts' morale, and "gave too little room for dissenting opinions".
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of any White House interference with the Centcom analysts regarding "specific political views".
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was opened after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congressional reports while the inspector general's investigation was ongoing.
But he also said that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense".
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of Defense Department officials).
But the accusations of the past year have raised the question of how far President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence is reminiscent of a controversy more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then George W. Bush administration, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, had only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker's team found, according to government sources, that contrary to government claims, air strikes against Islamic State-owned refineries did not have a significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were set up to sell oil on the black market.
But the findings were not published, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The USA wins its fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is in the offing
A day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea", she said.
I'm not one of those people who memorizes their gates.
But she knows this: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are tied in their group with the British, who are unbeaten after their 2-0 win over Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two will get the first and second place in their group of six teams.
The first-place winner will be able to outrun the strong Dutch women who are leading the other group for a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the Americans have created a surprising whirlwind of success four years after finishing last out of 12 at the London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey stick at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at 16, she became a U.S. National Player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she failed to qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the national team coach, and things began to turn for the better.
"It's a cultural change, a mental change, and a physical change", Bam said.
We didn't have the work ethic in London that we have now.
We've been able to turn the rudder completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the first half of the game with a backhanded close-range strike to Torreigen.
India had entered the tournament without a win, but the team showed surprising tenacity and held the score 1-0 into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the centre and bounced the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had previously been forced to score a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
So is Bam.
"We are in a good position", Parnham said, "but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday".
Amid the fury of the Olympics, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a fast-paced relay race between competition and ambition.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, handed out by the cross-country skier to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is a first-time Olympian and a bunch of women with freckles, could have been under these familiar names that are aired on Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for the Olympic gold medal in trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event in the same way.
Further from the center, and partly in the shadows, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We shall always have the breast swim and may it reign for a long time.
But if I may modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted in Sydney, it's been so underreported for the last 16 years that many of those I've interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampolining and until 2012 had no athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampolining has a certain outsider charm, in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, just a down-to-earth enthusiast.
It has the potential for humor - the cartoonish shudder of its never-ending bang - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", which means "jumping board".
Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to almost 30 feet in the air, and must complete a series of falling moves (twists, splits, and saltoes) before landing on their feet.
They are graded according to the official Olympic program according to design, difficulty and "time of flight".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
In their quest for gold, medal-seekers must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playing field.
They are not just chasing the finish line or the starting line, but in the broadcast they are chasing another sneering goal: the world or Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to move even a viewer to tears.
But it's also what I find a little tiring when I watch these games.
The trampoline provides a respite.
The trampoline jumper's vector is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is competition, not without difficulty, of course, but during the exercise there is no frantic attack on the target, no vaulting into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as zen as the competition at the Olympics can be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1:00 PM Eastern Time; the men's will be held on Saturday, also at 1:00 PM Eastern Time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days beginning at 2:00 p.m.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that's likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the opening up and objectification of male athletes - as recently suggested by the male US gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his breathless new fanbase.
"A generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that thousands of protesters were killed in gun battles during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
The government's response has been brutal, according to human rights groups.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Circulating videos of the protests, which are believed to be from last year or earlier this year, show security officers beating young people with sticks while forcing them to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights office is now demanding a full investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future", said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project manager for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable rate.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there's a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was far from a model of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently led the way in government repression - opposition in the country was constrained, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were exiled or imprisoned, killed, or driven into the wilderness.
But that could change.
"When you oppress people and they have no other option but to protest, it breaks out", said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A generation of protesting people.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to the stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition seat and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea, where a battle for control of the volatile, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turbulence and rearm.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding beneath the surface after years of hiccuping.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones became more common and Internet services improved.
Even when the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does periodically, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via proxies that hide their whereabouts.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and the Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amhara, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered politically and economically while exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that's changing, too.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella", said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and dominate the military, intelligence, commerce and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an undisclosed illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think in corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at picking up early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and render them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill", said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the place of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not have the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that more bloodshed will result.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that analysts said were apparently rigged by the government and then stolen.
During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, although fewer than in the previous months, and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation.
But this obviously did not prevent the Ethiopian government's internal discontent from intensifying.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Tigray-run businesses in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the U.S. and other Western allies in a strange position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.
"This", said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin line walk".
Donald Trump says his claim that Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by admitting that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.
It also puts his fellow fighters, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, in the strange position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant.
After making the allegation at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump backtracked on the claim on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that President and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic.
The tweet was in contrast to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was taking the accusation completely seriously.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump tone down the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to hear about it.
The latest storm of criticism is hitting Mr. Trump as he tries to shift the focus of his campaign to the economy because of falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He tweeted that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already used sarcasm in his defense.
In late July, he drew strong criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, though he later said, "Of course I meant that sarcastically".
This method allows Mr. Trump to push the language boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think one of his methods is to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then 'clarify' if necessary, depending on how the reaction is", said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of toning down the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more scathing tone as his poll numbers continue to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed a large lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid having to apologize for his provocative remarks, he frequently accuses his critics of misrepresenting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.
But while he has been increasingly the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's antics have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to side with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I believe what he's saying is legitimate political commentary", said Mr. Giuliani, when asked about the veracity of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It's true in that sense that before ISIS, Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, which is completely wrong, and that's why it happened, because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania campaign rally on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of pre-judging him and riding on his every word.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" TV experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once over priced by the market, Greenpoint Cafe is back
Verb Cafe was a crummy bar in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, and it didn't have Wi-Fi, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was superseded by the prices from his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, except for the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap shop".
But if New York is change, it's also innovation.
A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café who is the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels, bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment, too.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon and cheese sandwiches and there are garnishes such as capers and sauteed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many old customers were also displaced by Price's Williamsburg", he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and was a regular visitor to the Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked", she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, even though she ordered Blended Chai Tea that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is another long-standing and loyal customer of the Verb since its inception in 2003.
He used to go there before work and always order the same thing.
"I came quarter to seven every day like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter", he said.
Foto Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his everything-bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap business taking over the old store.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verbe with the café's cold brew coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we'll still accept their offer", Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have accepted the cafe as well.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it on display soon, so his new neighbors will feel welcome.
The location has other advantages.
A local juice bar wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There's a chance the cafe will expand into a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is all they need to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that walking into the café and ordering a new coffee felt like coming home.
"I had to smell it", he said.
The depressing essence of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March of 1933, shortly after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a penchant for Fifth Avenue's refined delicacies such as foie gras pate and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: eggs stuffed in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and as a dessert, a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people", said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the American people about how they should eat".
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and they're both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman's book, "97 Orchard", is about life in a Lower East Side apartment building from a food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, no-frills snack bar in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive slices, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and a mix of vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the roast beef, the couple thought it was appropriate for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era.
"Food that was rich was very popular", said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese, and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe was smiling.
"It must have lodged in the stomach like lead", he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastas were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" charts the ways the country coped with being no longer the land of monkeys.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for Americans", Coe began why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tight: Mystery foods like bread and casseroles became staples, with casseroles being "a wonderful way to recycle leftovers", observed Ziegelman, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the centerpiece of American cuisine, was becoming a rarely served luxury.
Weird combinations were tried, since a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense.
While researching for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition at lunchtime", says Coe.
"It was surreal", continues Ziegelmann.
Peanut butter and baked onions don't mix.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
Never before or since have home economists - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - so influenced the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to rise to the challenge of turning the pumpkin into a delicious meal like creamy spaghetti and carrots.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he dined like the millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce", Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't urged him to make an example of his stomach.
As the book describes, "the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in taste by Mrs. Roosevelt resulted in the White House having the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate".
Many of the Great Depression-era ways of handling food were discarded as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and how science has been applied to food.
The couple claimed to have better understood Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits - for example, how she could not throw food away - when writing the book.
"She had a real fear of wasting food", Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: "They actually made people sick".
That's when the windbag incident happened.
After clearing the plates at Eisenberg's, she and Coe brought out a dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert, which President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip", said Brickman, adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each one, with a little reluctance, dipped a spoon into the thick brown sliver.
Surprisingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe got three strikes.
Like a can-do budget-maker said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help".
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the line to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bombing attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil defense group that has saved the lives of nearly 60,000 people so far, according to the Bild newspaper.
2,900 volunteers risk their lives to rescue people from bombed-out houses and to provide first aid in war zones.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil guard showing him rescuing a baby from the rubble of a house in 11 hours went viral in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
But he never saw himself as a hero, saying, according to the picture, "For me, this is the real jihad".
"If I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me".
Just before Omar was killed in an attack, he had talked about the latest bombings in Syria in a video.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it", the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
It's a rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was released back into the sea after an examination aboard the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624, and he's swimming across the North Atlantic at a mile an hour -- to this day.
Greenland sharks don't get their young until they're 150 years old.
Slowly, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, averaging just 4,200 feet [1,220 m] in an hour.
When it does, the five-meter- long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/ hr - half the speed of a seal.
But this slow-motion lifestyle seems to be a recipe for old age.
However, Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science that a Greenland shark may be 392 years old.
"It's crazy", says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, when he comments on the fact that this is a world record for vertebrates.
It's true that evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland sharks become petrified.
But the evidence was lacking.
Greenland sharks are difficult to spot, since they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of about six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of the Greenland shark.
They measured their time-lapse rate when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
But the sharks do prey: In one animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal, and another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting dormant animals or patrolling the bottom of the sea of ice, looking for cadavers tumbling down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen had taken from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 as bycatch off Greenland or Spitsbergen.
The smallest shark was just over two feet [81 cm] long, while the largest was over two feet [502 cm].
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the shark's lens.
This lens center is formed before the shark is born, and the proteins in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in their lens cores.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960's, when nuclear weapons tests released greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
The third smallest animal, measuring 220 centimetres, had a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests in its lens, so it would have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a two-foot-long [493 cm] Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking shark of two-foot-long [50 cm] may actually be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland sharks only gave birth to young when they were over four meters long.
Now, researchers could assign an age to length.
Since one of the 392-centimetre-long animals was probably on the verge of sexual maturity and his age was determined at 156, it is obvious that the Greenland shark can reproduce for at least a century and a half.
This too is likely to be the current world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that these species of fish live primarily in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon-tip stuck in its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
The low temperatures often put the organisms of the animals living there on a low.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals also often grow extra large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal is more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible", explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building land in the double pack
The most recent meeting of the municipal council focused on construction issues.
The panel was relieved to hear Mayor Robert Putz announce that "the marketing of the newly designated residential areas can finally begin".
The Commission has decided to open the procedure for the sale of the land in the residential areas of Strasslweg and Schönau-West (Bereich Binderstraße - Expansion Section 1) to interested parties.
The local council is convinced that the built-up areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau will appeal to young families and well-equipped seniors alike.
As it was said, those who are willing to build can report to the Town Hall immediately, and the Municipal Council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots at its September meeting.
In order to meet requests for the establishment of additional industrial enterprises and the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to modify the land use plan, which was only established in the spring of this year, in sections.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, the industrial area already marked there will be extended by two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main has therefore the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote", says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IMF's Financial Markets and Real Estate Market expertise.
The UK is the only country in the world to have a central bank, and the UK is the only country in the world to have a central bank.
The so-called EU passport is currently only valid for entry into the UK.
Big U.S. banks are using it right now.
Several banks have already announced that they will be relocating.
The lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance expects to create 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
The IW says that Frankfurt is the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which has responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European System of Central Banks (ESRB).
The Court of First Instance had already held that the Court of First Instance had not been able to establish that the Commission had infringed Article 85 of the Treaty.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks because it allows them to communicate directly with the supervisory authorities", says IW professor Voigtländer.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers in the event of accidents at work is based on the principle of equal treatment for all workers.
The airport is much easier to reach thanks to its large size.
The city also has a wide range of commercial real estate.
"It is not so easy to find high-quality office space in Paris", says Voigtländer.
The French authorities also claim that the rent of first-class commercial properties on the Seine is 50% higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than its competitors, thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as lower crime rates.
In a ranking by the Mercer consultancy, the city is in seventh place, Luxembourg in nineteenth, Dublin in thirty-third and Paris in thirty-seventh.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference, "with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors", the IW concludes.
But London will remain Europe's leading financial centre despite the Brexit vote, say economists.
The balance of power also speaks for this: in London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, about 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal fees from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. magistrate ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, Gilead was cleared of a $200 million damages award for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of wrongdoing by Merck, including lying and other unethical acts.
In filing the lawsuit Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson told Freeman that Gilead is entitled to a reimbursement of the costs incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of lab work that was based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are currently combing the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-aligned Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under full control, but we are cleaning up", he told Reuters.
The Clintons make $10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% of their federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns Friday, which showed the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earning $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; the former Secretary of State cited an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her time in the State Department.
Clinton's nominee for vice president, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, released their tax returns for the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards when it comes to financial transparency", Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It's common for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, even though they're not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited a tax audit by the IRS as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train", Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential nominee.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release anything until the tax audit is complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about his wealth, his donations to charities, his business practices, and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already jumped on the issue, posting a video on the Internet on Friday, in which senior Republicans urge Trump to release his tax returns.
She also raised the issue on Thursday during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last few decades and to release his tax returns", she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a business reporter for the New York Times on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and advisors as saying that this may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign.
Clinton is supporting a bill named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that individuals earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he's also been subject to an IRS tax audit and that Trump is "afraid" of the voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns showed that they only received $100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox method to keep elephants from entering human settlements - they throw condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea for it years ago, has stepped up its support with the U.S. Nature Conservancy by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Before, many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed the ... toolkit, we have seen a change in attitude within these communities, where they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants", Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
Chilipolder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework into a condom, the end of which is turned down to the ignition cord.
When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A breath is usually enough to scare the elephant away.
A final option is a thrower who shoots a gold rain firework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The city council unanimously decides: No kiosk building on the banks of the St. Goar.
St. Goar's investment projects are usually taken up by small businesses - retail trade in the town centre is considered to have a considerable potential for expansion.
The proposal for the construction of a new ski shop on the banks of the Rhine, in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balkon, which is currently under construction, was now unanimously rejected by the city council.
"We generally welcome new business operators, but this kiosk does not fit in at this exposed site on the banks of the Rhine", said Michael Hubrath, for the CDU group.
Jewish director trashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-selection was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French film director with Jewish roots sparked a media uproar after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli preference because, according to one employee, Arab guests "demanded" it.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", took his anger out at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed among those that could be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been eliminated and erased?
- I have no idea.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to call Israel through its own call center.
Seeking an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind it made the director even more furious.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the voting be deleted", the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and dismayed by this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is an even greater disgrace.
That doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident caused quite a stir on the Internet, with people calling the whole thing a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of "groveling" to the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
"Shame on you", said another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the stately Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly denied all allegations, calling the incident a "mishap" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order not to put Israel on the fast-track list", a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel told the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the country prefix has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The trouble began when police officers tried to separate the students, leading the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
Under the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be converted to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests came days after mass demonstrators took to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was voted out of office by the Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran surges to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a strong interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking up existing ties with Iran, while new firms are poised to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran", said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons", said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian embassy issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia last year is being broken", he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he said.
Witness wanted: robbed a liquor store in the forest
A robbery was committed on Thursday night at the Rewe XXL liquor store on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Armed with a gun, three dark-clad individuals with disguised faces demanded cash from the liquor store clerk and then fled, first on foot and then presumably in a silver VW Golf.
How much money was taken, the police do not say.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 5'2" and 5'7", so relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the car park of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
The perpetrators must have run after the attack in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and escaped from the Schotterparkplatz located opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made observations related to the robbery at the time of the crime (about 7.45 p.m.) should report to the police.
Nagold: fun and games in summertime
The children and young people of the Nagold Child Protection Association's social group day group/social group work spent eight beautiful and happy days with their carers during their summer holidays in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
The lively group was accommodated in the quiet recreation area of Hardtwäldle during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were scheduled.
For one thing, I was going to the petting zoo.
The other was to Maulbronn, where a special children's tour was held in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip was to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and plank.
Children and caregivers were spoiled culinary with their home-prepared meals such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, the Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and the Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry was made from pearls and stones, or a Roman mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Bunte evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun was smiling and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna pastoral unit were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, they've been through four stages.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the Ministrants, which is expected to take place in two years, the Superior of the Ministrations of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage of several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and it was finally decided for the episcopal city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Pforte der Barmherzigkeit at the Freiburger Münster opened for this purpose.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern were on their way.
The night before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim's cross and gave the pilgrim's blessing.
From Horb, the train was driven to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a church of Our Lady, and thus the pilgrimage was started from the monastery.
Each morning and evening tour was framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way the Minis at field crosses, chapels or churches stopped again and again to sing together a song from specially composed pilgrim songbook.
The parishes of the local parishes were each available for overnight accommodation.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty meal as well as a hearty dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, we continued on to Gütenbach, via Furtwangen.
The next day, the St. Peter's stage was reached, the most arduous part of the route, but in the sweltering heat, it was necessary to descend from about 500 meters and then climb again.
The reward was a night of barbecuing on the beach.
After the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went on to the final stages to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral later in the afternoon and entered the Gate of Mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked.
The Minis arrived at the destination of the pilgrimage and were greeted by Markus Obert, a member of the Cooperator.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to view the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day, there was still time for the Breisgau Metropolis.
In the afternoon we took the train back to Horb.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scottish cyclist Callum Skinner storms home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome as the British team defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken on, and the youngster made the legend proud as he stormed home to claim a victory from the New Zealand favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago as Hoy claimed the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they finished a modest sixth at the World Railway Championships in London in March, despite Hoy's withdrawal.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time to prevent it.
Hoys retirement created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man they stuck with when they saw potential in the Scot that now has unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold.
Hindes was just behind after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hinds as they stepped onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison".
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph in 2012 with Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later retracted that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a stunning victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the grandstand".
We've been coming together as a team for the last three months.
We've come so far so badly in so many world titles, it was unbelievable to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, who won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we've got five successful days at the Velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it's within the realm of possibility that he could repeat Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
That would mean a haul of six golds and one silver for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born).
That's what Hoy's is.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will run over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it for the moment".
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win by yourself.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal match of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.
They reached the finish in 3:51.942.
The world record, which won gold in London 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final rounds (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, with Wiggins sure to be the focus.
He had a fight with the officials yesterday before qualifying when officials called him to measure his height.
In the women's competition, which will continue and conclude tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4:13,260.
Team GB is relying on their strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and bring home a bevy of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
There were dramas in the background, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid accusations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, looking at the first night of the competition at the Velodrome, it looks as though the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland smelter is in doubt due to the termination of the power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and hundreds of jobs for workers - are at stake as the plant operator terminates the power supply contract, and thus all supply contracts, the supplying power company said.
This move followed the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year not to provide further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure.
Furthermore, there could be a domino effect, as the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and is at risk of shutting down.
This follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the cost of electricity for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expected three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold minority shares.
'AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, which will mean additional physical demand for electricity from the smelter,' the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called 'security transactions' which were to have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
'Thus, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in FY17', the electricity supplier said.
Any potential impact on the revenues of AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts at $187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa stated that the decision to cancel the contracts did not affect Alcoa's 'ability to operate the smelter or to provide the power supply to the smelter'.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect from November this year, although it still owes an explanation as to why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts warn that the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle could close due to the poor economic conditions in the industry.
Referring to analysts' statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the electricity market is in a precarious situation.
And for us as electricity producers, that would not be good", he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and has walked the runway at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, seeing this cover made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The cover's unveiling was followed by a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?) scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the all-time favorite showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, and ending with a classic twist: they've all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we forgot you?", with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast slot at 8am), but Kris had to somehow get her other girls to participate in this publicity.
With the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has surely begun.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have beaten Vogue on the cover (she and her husband Kanye West were featured on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league unto itself.
The September issue is Vogue's biggest seller of the year.
With a volume that resembles a cartoon rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was advertised on 615 of the 832 pages of the Walzer).
The cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, images of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In the last few years, there's clearly been more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar-winning Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the slim chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or today's teenagers who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They're really talented women who excel in the entertainment business.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been a little tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her fellow model Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
Those feelings boiled back when news broke of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But riding around on the resentment seems to be getting past the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to watch her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Community law centers turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable are being turned away from community-based legal centers each year as the industry grapples with the impact of further funding cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, disadvantaged workers, victims of violence and those who cannot afford unjust evictions and the like - are already turned away from free legal advice and counsel when they apply.
The already overburdened legal services of the municipality are preparing for further cuts.
Starting next June, these law centers are scheduled to lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
The director of the Queensland Community Law Centres, James Farrell, said that the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that without an overturning of the Federal Government's decision, the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being denied key services you need", he said.
People coming out of abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and overwhelming debt, families going through separation, workers unjustly laid off -- all of these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable people will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, and Queensland Senator George Brandis, to immediately lift these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need in legal trouble.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community law centers and their client communities and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged after staff allegedly pulled weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after being informed that their campaign manager for North Carolina had pointed a gun at a staff member while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte County Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software developer for the state's campaign.
Bordini said he waited months for the matter to be resolved internally before realizing that "it wasn't going to happen".
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and slammed the barrel into Vincent's kneecap", Bordini alleged in his indictment.
After complaining to local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage", said Bordini.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a stir when he told a North Carolina crowd that "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun enthusiasts - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed a judge.
Trump's campaign made clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint is seeking damages from the Campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological harm.
Trump's press secretary, Hope Hicks, was unavailable for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip have also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, is reporting that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were unanswered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Superior Court, County of Mecklenburg, Charlotte. The case is not yet in court.
Berlin/Schwerin: Polls before state elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), the ruling parties SPD and CDU are expected to suffer considerable losses.
This is the result of representative surveys carried out by the INSA opinion research institute for the Bild newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black coalition could hardly continue to rule in the north, according to the poll results in Berlin, this is not possible.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good chances of remaining head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD has fallen from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party would thus be just ahead of the CDU, which could again reach 23%, according to the survey.
The third place is contested between the Left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the Landtag for the first time with 19 percent.
The Greens, despite slight losses, with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) are back in the Schwerin Landtag.
The NPD and the FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
In the Berlin parliamentary elections, the SPD would only reach 23 percent according to the survey (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would have 14 percent of the seats in the lower house for the first time.
With 5%, the FDP could hope for a return, the Pirates would miss the entrance, unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: the first smartphone to be built
E-mail and Internet in time-lapse: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator was launched.
The successors are now the world's rulers - its manufacturer was a disaster.
The device weighed almost a pound and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it didn't fit well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.
The built-in memory was originally eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone now comes with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came to market exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the world's first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices online, but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
But 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as a 'Western pocket office'.
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for the standards of that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached.
Even the ability to access web pages via HTML browsers was possible, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a little antenna, and the phone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite high: 2700 D-Mark, or about 1,400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have predicted in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has changed since then.
Smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone division suffered an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up.
The market today is dominated by vendors, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online all the time and everywhere is a fact of life for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices have been sold, of which 555 million are Samsung and Apple alone.
The worldwide turnover of these devices is about 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the thriving businesses of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has developed around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, all easily operated by a touch screen.
Apple's triumph began, and to this day, the iPhone is the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the upper hand.
They disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a given 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now checks his or her mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put away our smartphones", said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for human resources on the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered both a curse and a blessing.
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and to all of London, but to the whole country.
To me, this was the biggest attraction at Heathrow, just like it was in London in 2012, when we went to great lengths to make sure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating new opportunities for local residents and businesses near Heathrow.
We will be creating 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and ending youth unemployment in the airport area for our local communities alone.
As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who think the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England would never be ready for the Games and that we would embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question it is asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not for individuals.
Expansion is one way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth and a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has delivered an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years running - to T2, which was built in the middle of the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for Great Britain and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be another.
It is time that we channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" of ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad blocking is a "cat and mouse" game, according to one of the software makers.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post announcing that users could update their in-app filters to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its desktop site would change the coding of its ads to make it harder for ad blocks to know which part of the page is an ad.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the detractors has been going on since the invention of ad blockers", and that it's possible that Facebook will come up with a new solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fray is a strong indication of how alarming ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, there are about 200 million people around the world who use ad blockers, almost four times as many as in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is looking at ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue that Facebook's investment in such a move seems worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over the ads that are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks new filters were a concern because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue", a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a dumb tool, so we've focused instead on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman killed in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was found on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling in witnesses after a woman was struck by several vehicles on a highway in an apparent suicide in the early hours of Thursday.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the street and was hit by several cars, police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to the incident to come forward.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be charged.
Could a collision have been avoided?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide", said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each case - in which a person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that motorists should not assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent homicide after she ran over and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne on a night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman - who had responded to an emergency call - was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with further information about the incident Thursday near Morges should contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably habitable at one time, according to projections from a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, may have once had conditions similar to Earth's.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still slowly rotated away.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to support life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, Venus's slow rotation exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months", explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those on Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus that resembles the evolution that planetary scientists had previously suspected.
Although it was once thought to be habitable, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated, and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen ran out, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of control over the team's decision-making process.
Alternate President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I've spent a lot of time over the summer thinking about how I could improve this team, give it more depth, give it what it needs, and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today", said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him nothing but the best for the future.
Roy was named the league's Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his debut season with the Avalanches in 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches posted a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season, falling behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and one with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike
The labour dispute over the pay of North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield services provider Wood Group have been sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the dispute resolution process for the present dispute", a joint statement said.
We're going to have a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next year, to re-address these issues.
The unions said their latest strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9% this year due to negative market pressures.
The company's rate cut follows a 10% decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the space it needed to weather the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to exit its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations following its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes to take place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for the many, not just the few", he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea, compared to an average of around $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measuring the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars in the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation times relate to planet formation.
"By comparing our results with other star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age and even the history of its solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're turning fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars are spewing out vast amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable starspot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive ones.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars", Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar qualities, such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older", Rebull said.
There is much more to learn, such as how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dancing shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their recent analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star is leaving the game
Tears ran faster from base to base for Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. Baseball star on his best days.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and I love this team".
"I say 'goodbye' to both of them", said the 14-time Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star.
Rodriguez was named the league's most valuable player three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signing of a ten-year contract earned him $27 million a year since 2007.
He will continue to work as a consultant and youth coach until the end of his contract on 31 December 2017, on full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez has long paid off with performance.
He hit 696 home runs, had 3,114 hits and scored 2021 runs for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005 the Yankees.
With Hall of Famer Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar scores in the major statistics.
But the 41-year-old is unlikely to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - has been on the court, so controversial has been his performance off the court.
In 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN that he had used banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to his involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is the prime suspect in receiving performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league might have even done me a favor for 2014 because I've played 20 years without a break", Rodriguez said then suffizantly.
His farewell days are not without noise.
While many baseball legends have been given the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez has often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't involve a farewell tour".
"My job is to try to win every game", said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have had relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy letters from fans of the Yankee arch-rivals Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the fans sang in the 4-9 loss to the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first in doping cases
Caught: Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is banned from Rio because of a positive drug test.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping case.
A captured athlete almost won a medal.
The first official cases of doping have been reported ahead of the seventh day of competition, the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive and were disqualified in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically-watched athletics competition, this news comes at an untimely time.
The Commission is therefore proposing to extend the period of suspension of the current ban on the use of the drug to the period of six months.
The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) confirmed her exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the 100 m butterfly final, missing the bronze medal by 0.09 seconds.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to participate in the preliminaries of the 50m freestyle.
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open sample B and a hearing.
The national federation is "taking the matter very seriously and demands Chen's full cooperation in the investigations", Xinhua quoted a statement as saying: "We will cooperate with the CAS and accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but the CAS that is responsible for sanctioning the athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, news of Danekowa's positive test leaked, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive", this was "an incredible shock", she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
"The only explanation could be supplements", said the athlete.
The report says the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, and BNT says the B-sample has already tested positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borisov immediately responded to the criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes are not drawing the right conclusions", he said. "We Bulgarians are under surveillance, so many have already been excluded".
For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping-burdened nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of Adrian Zielinski, the London Olympic champion in the 85 kg weight class, was also revealed. Like his brother Tomasz, he tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier.
Both deny taking the drug, but both are banned from competing in the 94-kg weight class.
Before the start of the athletics, especially the case of Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
The world association of athletics, the IAAF, had banned the entire Russian team from the race, except for one exception, because of systematic doping. The Kenyan team also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous offenses in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang is peeing purple".
"If I see the podium in the 200m freestyle, I want to throw up", Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with Mack Horton, an Australian.
"I have no time for doping cheats", he said.
Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but was only suspended for three months.
Data theft: How hackers blackmail their victims to collect ransom
Extortion malware programmers are now targeting businesses - and they're succeeding.
According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany by malware-prevention specialist Malwarebytes, 40 percent of the companies surveyed had been the victim of at least one, sometimes multiple, ransomware attack in the past 12 months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have been the target of ransomware extortion.
Forty percent of victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the attackers in order to regain access to the systems and data that were attacked.
The perpetrators are increasingly specializing their extortion software in attacks on corporate networks, according to the observations of Malwarebytes.
If they succeed, the potential ransom to be extorted is much higher than for private users.
"We are seeing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware", says Malwarebytes' CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with Die Welt.
In 2008, most malware was designed to send out ads.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were targeted, but the shift to corporate attacks has been occurring at an alarmingly rapid rate in recent months.
Ransomware works in a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches for files that have been recently modified, such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files are encrypted by the ransomware and the originals are permanently erased.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
To get the end-to-end encryption code to the files, the victims have to wire money -- usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, it is sensitive customer data or project databases that are at stake for companies, without which production stands still.
So, the damage is higher when a ransomware attacks.
22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely stop business, in one case people's lives were in danger.
In Germany, hospitals have already been the victims of attacks, which may put patients at acute risk of losing medical records.
"We always tell victims: 'Don't pay, you are only adding to the problem,'" Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay, they get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to refuse the demand of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in the operation.
Hackers know this and they'll do anything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and the interaction with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion that the offenders are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to make more money.
They chat with their victims, explain how to pay with bitcoin, set up free support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And when private individuals are ransomed for a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the high potential and relatively riskless returns from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus company Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware in about a week".
But it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software build to the actual ransomware.
The malware kits that we've seen so far have been created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, flat-rate price of between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The package includes an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed", says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then seek out more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software to the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from one criminal, and then commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, criminals then commission spammers to distribute it", explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that have become better at securing their data.
Over 50 percent of the IT executives surveyed by Malwarebytes believe that they can defend against ransomware by using file backup and scanning software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If encrypting data is not enough to threaten successful seizure, the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations", explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential for damage is many times greater than before, depending on the type of data.
The Internet of Things could also be a new target for criminals.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could take control of a thermostat connected to the Internet.
In the middle of winter, the unlocking of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom to some victims.
So if, in the future, instead of heating, the perpetrators block an entire production line in a factory, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for the road
The HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
The small HR-V is Honda's attempt to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan.
It sounds a bit overkill, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m tall and appears rather small, it has plenty of space for passengers in both the front row and the rear, and it does not appear cramped anywhere.
The interior is well-made and comfortable, except for the cockpit top, which is a little off.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
Not only is there a 453 l boot space for raised and 1026 l for folded backs, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The back seats can be folded up like movie seats, providing storage space from the floor to the ceiling, which is 4 feet (1.24 m) high.
The trunk is well loaded, but the loading height is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 at 650 mm.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should be doing his job a little quieter, though.
The daily consumption of 4.7 litres per 100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-liter petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is well balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top-of-the-range "Executive" variant tested.
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (operating up to speed 32), the Collision Warning System and the Lane Keeping Assist.
The collision warning system sometimes irritates because it rates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when it ranges.
The remote light assistant is very reliable.
And the intelligent timing device responds to the traffic sign recognition and reduces the speed when needed.
But full connectivity is only available for the top gear: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets are located under the armrest, making them somewhat difficult to reach.
The 29000 euros for the top-of-the-line diesel is fine.
If you don't want to invest that much, you can get the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: Crash on the passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for a passenger falling on the flight deck.
The Court held that liability could be envisaged only in the case of risks typical of air transport, as the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, Düsseldorf) had argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
The accident could have happened anywhere, however - it was a general risk to life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any compensation.
Sickness: When does the organiser pay?
Sick holidaymakers will only be reimbursed after their trip if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But that's only true if more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to have the same symptoms.
In the case under discussion, a family had become seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
She spent most of the holiday in the room.
The illness was attributed to a faulty sewage system that allegedly contaminated the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was flawed - and filed a complaint against the organizer.
The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in court.
The sewage system was indeed defective.
However, the organiser did not learn of the event until shortly before the plaintiffs' departure.
He had to assume that the seawater was fine by then.
He did not therefore infringe his duty to inform, according to the judgment.
Especially since the water samples showed no contamination.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - is part of the general risk to life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must react to the threat of terrorism with both prudence and determination.
One thing is certain: our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow the terrorists to have this triumph.
But if criminals were to leave the country more quickly, it would increase security and also increase the public's acceptance of the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to see the proposals implemented by the 2017 federal elections.
He also announced a further increase in the number of security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years".
The Commission is also proposing to make the European Parliament more involved in the fight against terrorism.
The aim is to improve video surveillance and to amend the law on firearms in such a way that it becomes more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed obligation of confidentiality for doctors should be respected according to de Maizière's words.
He said that the EU was not prepared to accept the death penalty for any crime, but that it was not prepared to accept the death penalty for all crimes.
The Minister believes that better social assistance is needed to counteract the radicalisation of refugees.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To pursue criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security".
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism.
"This was a slap in the face for the hardliners in the CDU/CSU", Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Freitag).
The EU has already rejected calls for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a common position on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of geographical indications.
You can't forbid everything you reject, and I reject the burqa.
Rules can be discussed, for example, in traffic or for witnesses in court.
The Green leader, Simone Peter, accused the minister of trying to simulate power and agency with new anti-terrorist packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Floating sentences and a tightening of the right of residence will not bring more security to the people in this country".
Improved traffic flow on the motorway link
It regularly gets stuck on the bypass - here's a picture from November.
But that is to change: the legal loophole is to be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are stuck in traffic jams on the roads around the area every evening when they cross the motorway junction (A 43).
The state road construction company will extend the right-hander track by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Street and the Weseler Street exit on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 and 17 August).
Motorists can then turn right off the Hammer Road.
The major advantage: traffic is divided up earlier, improving the overall flow on the busy section of the highway 51.
The idea of extending the trip was the idea of the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The road congestion on the Zubringer annoys motorists especially between 5 and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Way and sometimes even beyond.
The cause is the needle hole on the B 51 just off the Weseler Straße exit.
From here, traffic is diverted to the one-lane highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt a good three and a quarter years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the necessary load-bearing capacity to handle mainly heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
The national company cannot say how long this bottleneck and the associated congestion will last.
But it's going to be years, because the bridge has an official lifespan of 2034 years.
The State company deliberately chose the low-traffic period during the school holidays to extend the right-of-way, as disabilities were to be expected.
Traffic will be routed past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: cultural activities for schools
The international class of the Forest School attended the play "The Invisible House".
Nima's and the Young Theatre are planning a musical project.
The association Nima's enables young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" by the Jungen Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students between 11 and 15 years old attended the staging in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migrant or refugee background, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will cooperate in the coming season as part of a musical theater project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migrant background between 14 and 20 years old will have the opportunity to attend professionally-led courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the theatre and theatre language teaching are in planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" is continuing.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain, not hail: Hope for better weather
The weather has been a blow to stargazers in southwestern Germany on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was not suitable for observing the celestial spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is in Saturday night.
The weather should be fine, and we'll probably see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
Shooting stars are called Perseids, and they are the fastest shooting stars at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They are so called because they appear to be from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
A Restful Night: Tips for Fighting the Trouble
In the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning, you can't think about sleep long before the alarm goes off.
It's not even recreational.
At least you are in good company with such problems. According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep problems, and more than 10 percent often or consistently find their sleep unrequitable.
What are the symptoms of sleep problems or sleep disturbances?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can have a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weß, a member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Medicine.
But what is commonly known as insomnia is a sleep disorder that affects sleep.
Many people feel that sleeping through the night is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German Family Physicians Association with a practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What Causes Sleep Disorders?
The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.
These may be biological, psychological, behavioral, or medicinal.
Often the sleep disorder is a manifestation of another disorder.
"Very early awakenings are common, especially in cases of depression", says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors condition each other.
For example, a person with a herniated disc may not be able to lie down, may wake up every two to three hours, and may start to ponder everyday problems and anxieties, says Weeß.
This causes tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you see a doctor if you have trouble sleeping?
If you have trouble sleeping well for at least three nights a week for a month and are affected during the day, see your doctor, advises Weiss.
The symptoms may be a variety of things: feeling down, tired, sleep deprivation, difficulty in paying attention and concentrating, being easily irritable, mood swings, or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to identify its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, and medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for no more than two weeks.
There are hardly any sleep doctors in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre at the Charité University of Medicine in Berlin.
Therefore, first consult your family doctor if you have trouble sleeping, advises Dr. Weeß.
He can use tests to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who's going to sleep lab, and what happens there?
Doctors recommend that a sleep laboratory be used to examine snorers who are having trouble breathing, those who are sick with daytime fatigue, those who are sleepwalking, or those who cannot identify the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don't have to prepare for the exam.
You should spend the day as normal.
"Just don't take a nap", Fietze said, "you know, you're not going to be able to sleep.
After the wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
Besides the electrodes on the body, you wear nose goggles, a breast belt, and a finger probe.
And a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping.
How can sufferers deal with the problems?
There are quite a few screws you can put on for better sleep.
The key is: regular bedtime and wake-up time, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - because then you start counting, and that is not helpful at all.
What 's the jungle camp got to do with missing medals in swimming ?
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.
In December 2014, he won his first gold at the World Short Course Championships in Doha, setting his first world record at the same time.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting his critically-faced ex-teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets a €20,000 bonus and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised by missing medals", the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page late Friday.
The system of promotion in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries which promote a lot and do not pay much attention to the issue of doping or even practice it.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be stopped here", he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered with the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) Germany nine months before his first start.
That is the way it should be with countries.
"Those who cannot be checked by independent WADA/FINA inspectors for a certain period of time before the World Championships are not allowed to participate", says the Hamburg-born athlete, who now runs an ice cream parlor.
Airport: Gang of Baggage Thieves Arrested
Professional thieves at the airport in Düsseldorf
On Thursday, the civil investigation unit of the Düsseldorf police arrested two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several bag and baggage thefts as a gang.
At about 9:30 p.m., civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft offenses.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year, acting in a cooperative, cooperative and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Police Office 34 can prove four acts against thieves who had come to Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had collected a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few small lily trees, and a few remaining cobblestones in between: Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten, and a organic store.
Someone sprayed "ugly" on the facade of a gray house.
A building with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here by 2017.
However, in recent weeks, articles about this "trendy district", as the real estate agency Friedrichshain calls it, have been dominated by images of burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but the ground floor is still occupied and used for events.
The Berlin Innensenator Henkel in particular had spoken out several times since the beginning of the year for a harsh police action against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the ground floor rooms, the Cadder Forge, with 300 police officers, had been cleared on June 22, police officers, according to official statements, patrolled the site for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three ambulances, blocking parts of the road and preventing visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved in amid cheers from sympathizers and local residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents are walking with their children, people are sitting on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are chatting in the evening.
In the immediate vicinity of the housing projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.
Many residents do not have a primary concern about violence: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
They share the concern with the residents of the housing projects about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez who mostly wanted police protection from vandalistic leftists.
The gulf that the Berlin Innensenator and the police are creating between squatters and their neighbours does not exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was originally a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
The occupation of houses and the resulting housing projects have also long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Rigaer.
While Mainz was evacuated in a street battle under heavy police orders, many of the projects in the Riga area have been legalized and are still occupied by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly attractive to tourists and Berliners from all over the world: residents from the GDR and former occupiers now share their kies with them.
This is also reflected in rents, which have increased by almost 60% in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga area are seen as symbols of this development: they are recognisable by the glass panes thrown in or the freshly painted facades sprayed with paint.
No other street was mentioned so often this year alongside the words "left-wing violence".
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem is that they are not necessarily affected by crime: statistics show that crimes such as assault are almost exclusively against police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of insecurity.
As for violence, she's reassuring: the people in 94 are their neighbors, they certainly weren't.
The famous burning cars have not been seen in Riga for a long time.
For the architect, her street is not a crime hot spot, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more out of each other than anywhere else".
Neugebauer moved to Rigaer Street and stayed.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, the politicians and the media, who suddenly claimed the right to define the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former holes that displace the old residents.
"These are ultimately property-owning houses, which are not interesting to many people here - people who are not so well educated live here", she says.
"I cannot condone violence and destruction".
But what if no one ever listens to you?
This is causing frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For those who are upset about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Those who move should be aware of this - just as someone who moves to a bar area can complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new Commissioner for Refugees
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.
She's also a local social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.
The social pedagogue supports the administration team around Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as the point of contact for all actors: refugees, the Refugee Aid Working Group, the administration, the authorities and anyone else involved.
Rain Kunde from the work circle suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the egg-laying wool-milking cow who has a problem above all.
This is what some - not so much mockingly as referring to the large number of areas of activity that are desirable - had in mind when the administration wanted to put the position on the market.
The search for a management professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, was a real egg-laying sheep.
But administrative work is not her main area of interest, says Annika Deuschle.
The main issues are organisation, working with people on the ground and behind the scenes, and networking.
The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.
She's got a 50% stake for three years.
"It was high time", says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports both full-time and part-time actors.
There are problems, big and small, organizational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be in the Wasenstraat
The problem of finding accommodation for the refugees who have been accepted as refugees has been a serious problem for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own homes or in rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation facilities are borne by the local authorities.
The responsibility changes from the county council office to the municipality and the job centre.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration cannot find private housing.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to deal with the problem.
So, communal housing must be equipped, as they say.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraat.
But it's not just housing.
The key is perspective, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to permanent accommodation, there are internships, training centres, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary support activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good", reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the yard or assist housekeepers, doing charitable work - and doing so in a motivated and orderly way, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outcome.
This is not "occupational therapy".
But activity is not just work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and Kunde.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs activities such as sports, contact with local people and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here again, administration and volunteers are stepping in.
It was essential that the refugees should feel that they were wanted and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it's just a matter of time and that they can bridge that time in a meaningful way, for example, by taking language classes.
If you ever feel that you can't help anyone in Urbach, that you're not allowed to work and that you're useless, you'll never fit in.
The clear majority were motivated.
But there are also cases of problems, says Kunde honestly, "people who can do nothing".
He said it was all a "mommy's job".
A difficult question: after the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No", says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some might call naïve".
The Commissioner said that the staff were already sensitised.
The Commission has also been working on a number of other projects.
They're afraid the assassins will bring them down to the lowest level of disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it", says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, the main staff and volunteers have to look for activities locally and in the region.
They always have in mind that a new influx of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
The Commission is not prepared to accept the amendments.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.
"We are not yet where we want to be in Urbach", says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the urban population is already struggling to integrate the previous population in a reasonable way.
There are about 100 of them at the moment, mostly young men.
But when people are in need and you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
Helicopter thieves wanted
The police helicopter flew over various areas for about an hour - to no avail.
Two unknown men forced their way into an apartment in a multi-family house on Linden Road at around 8.50 on Friday morning.
The resident surprised them and drove the Unholde into flight.
The two men were about 5'6" to 5'6", well-masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled downtown.
The police sent several patrol teams and a police helicopter to search for him.
The search was unsuccessful.
The unknowns may have been seen near the apartment or during their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on Imbiss
After an attack on a restaurant in Ulm, the police are investigating six suspects from the rock scene for serious disturbance.
The police said Friday that evidence and drugs were seized during house searches.
Around 20 masked men in a rock-like group had thrown bottles and rocks at the shop window of a food court in July, police said.
After that, they're said to have attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
Then they ran.
The damage to the Imbiss and the adjacent building amounted to EUR 10000
According to the investigators, the incident involved a fight between a Kurdish gang and a Turkish gang in the Ulm rock scene.
