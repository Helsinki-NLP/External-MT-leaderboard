This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were top brown with a leafy or carotenoid-colored underside.
The fund also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft (called spindle) but had other features of feathers  beards and rays, researchers concluded that the spindle was likely a late evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but for temperature control or appearance.The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample originated from adult feathers and not from the plumes of a hippopotamus.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational force on the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory holds that most dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

This extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant "is very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed sheet of paper identifying their candidate and place it in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballots must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see each part of the process. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision by special guards.

This is common in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and courts have deemed the release of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when publishing photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecuting the case, told reporters that it would not comment further until the charges were brought.
The document refers to the disputed border area claimed by Palestine on the basis of the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War, according to the leak.
Further allegedly dealt with issues including the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority wants to allow this presence for only five years.
The proteins in the complementary pest control study should be closely monitored by rangers as the study is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director of park protection and heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four selected shooters received first-person safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional parliament yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failed elections, which have been partially due since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "non-hazardous".
The ministry responded to the folly of the report by Apple by calling it "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (Friday 9:19 am GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management said no damage was reported nationwide.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
A few hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an older dam that had to be flushed into the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that when a hormone was released, it would accelerate fetal development of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government agents recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even a little more... I love her and miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, those who were against Australia as a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim 100m and 200m freestyle in three events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his complaints.
He was unable to take medication to overcome his pain, as they are banned while playing.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Some people verified the discovery using different hardware until early February and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets were likely to be associated with organic substances that could form proteins and support life, a source of water supplies to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year at age 53 and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow airplanes to fly short distances, saving millions of tons of fuel and reducing CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to earlier ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transport and no overcrowding at Wembley and parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of moving vehicles increased the possibility that the game would be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new species of eagle on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although the process likely took much longer due to the crossing between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be made into a thin wire that can be twisted and broken, it can be worked with a hammer and rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and bonded to other metals, and can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures and books, called "picture manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which fold up and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every home connected to an elaborate drainage system.
In the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, relics of upstream water systems have been found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would gather in mixed company.
If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're calling a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light in view.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in ways that are indescribable. The biggest advantage we owe to the bicycle is much faster and easier transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized catches from rabbits to antelopes and red deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging house cats) that eat the much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task that each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most active cats, living in large groups, also called packs.
A pack consists of one to four adult males, along with up to thirty females and males.
The women are usually close relatives because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion cubs behave similarly to those of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very lethal to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger's cry is not like the full-voiced cry of a lover, but rather like a phrase of shrouded, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals: they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all animals that the Ocelot eats are much smaller than him.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals for food by sniffing where they were on the ground.
They can see well in the dark and move easily, and they hunt their prey by adapting to their environment and then colliding with it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (as if they move across a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island and thus cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new properties or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new surroundings, they begin to look less and less like the other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can never again be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants produce their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes and produce our food from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set of teeth on the gum, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, and its diet included mosquitoes, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also caught everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't catch it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had many strange or unusual foods, including wild boar, pohon, snails, and a species of rodent called the sloth.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women sat down and ate, the rich men liked to hold banquets together, where they sat on the side while eating.
Meals in Ale Rome could not include foods brought from the Americas or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
They had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a snack.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which they believed to be the home of God.
Men sacrificed to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, to which only the priests were allowed to serve.
Sometimes, specially pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was called the Most Holy Place.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were just open doors on the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences in people, kings, customs and in the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Legacy of the Templars", you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up for storage early in his life.
So it's likely that the property was simply added as a description.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and annexed Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also somehow determines the size of society.
A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustained cultural footprint, and an orderly spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear, leaving no important historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation first formed a weak central government with Congress as their sole component.
Congress had no power to raise taxes, and as there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on government agencies, often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
It also has no authority to override tax laws and excise duties between states.
The clauses required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government on the shoulders of lightly, so their representatives were often reluctant.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after Germany, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipel" in geographical terms.
Taiwan traces its origins to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing along the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the native's grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they once looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
The most commonly used photographic format for still images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but especially its side ratios were adopted by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually a little bit curved, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is here referred to as 3:2.
Many popular formats (e.g. APS-format family) correspond to this aspect ratio or approximate it.
The often abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It is understood that the most effective location for the main motif is at the intersection of lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For a thousand years, Christianity had held European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
Their all-pervasive power was felt by everyone, from kings to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are specifically there for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this basic principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by more international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain designated international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire sections of the ocean, which put even neutral ships at risk.
As there was only a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, the nations were determined to prevent a repeat of such a situation.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his bag, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of referring to different eras: each phase of China or each dynasty in power was a different dynasty.
The most famous of these eras was the 'Three Kingdoms' era, which lasted 60 years and ran between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to take them.
The same was true for the military, because instead of rank lists based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also encouraged other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was strongly interested in things outside this worldly life. He repeatedly visited a cave known as 'Hira' on Mount 'Noor' (Light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has endured for centuries, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is located on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you knew it existed.
There is only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. If one is in a cave, one can only see a little of this world or hear a little.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giseh Plateau, or "Giseh Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were erected in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "topmost" shape is a V, and the "bottom" shape is a bracket or square with no bottom.
Up means you start at the top and press the bow and down means you start at the bottom (where your hand holds the bow) and press the bow.
An upstroke usually generates a softer tone, while an offstroke is stronger and more definite.
Feel free to mark your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed markings are there for musical purposes, so they should usually be kept.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced back to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a mob of Versailles marketwomen.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a mob member held up the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, as much of the spending and interest on the bonds flowed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits that would result from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the era of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices; from the technology-push or technological need to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially determined.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a cluster of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce costs for vehicle owners.
Mass motorization also leads to a higher accident rate on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a large element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In connection with the Romantic period, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with this geography emerged, which were, because they were in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th to 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the Byzantine culture in the East had a very strong influence on Geze.
However, the styles in the West could lag 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments from that time as a result of the crucifixion was that people began to use buttons to fasten the vestments.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological system that combines seed from the ecoregion with crop production or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, and they allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be indistinguishable by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style usage that includes fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods of questioning the importance of socialization is to refer to some fortunate cases of children who were not socialized by neglect, bad luck or verbal abuse by adults while growing up.
Some want children were locked up by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this was the child's task to return to the rejection of the severe mental or physical abuse by the parents.
Teenage runaways may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others should be abandoned by beasts, some should live alone in the wilderness.
When the child is raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost completely similar to those of the respective pet, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but an aid that supports individuals who are making a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but this also applies to the small office clips in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is intended to ask, ask, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are given for all sorts of reasons and care, ranging from neglect, to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, social and educational, but that's the way it is.
We see the care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our care system is designed to provide a safe home, caregivers who are very warm, stable training and reliable health care.
Care should be provided for all necessities that were missing in the house from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The Internet's unique characteristics lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and gratification.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are considered important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal engagement' and 'sustaining relationships' were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they studied audience reactions to Internet sites.
The use of video recordings has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions  facial movements of several milliseconds .
First, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is suffering by correctly interpreting a microexpression.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech due to hearing loss are almost able to judge sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities are shared in the interpretation of human behavior of animals such as domestic animals.
Twenty-first century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two poles with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements with the available plant resources.
Moreover, there are serious consequences if you don't: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been proteins and leaves and pulses, but which are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (seafood, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a wealth of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking during the normal sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10  60 minutes later).
This can be done quite easily by using a relatively low-frequency alarm clock to bring you to consciousness, but not to wake you up completely.
If you reset the clock in sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is directly correlated with the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can bring relief, and the only thing standing in the way of that is our own complacency and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been extended through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques of Indian yoga.
The basic tenets of Tibetan Buddhism are simple: Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening the Kundalini energy through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Guruyoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war, the former allies became enemies, which started the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be worn by the troops on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in a few other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were, however, thwarted almost overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army marched into the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient way to transport many people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that its nation retains the ability to move its people and goods while disrupting the ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly with submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain and the rest of Europe.
Ghosts were apparently first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples considered them to be easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
House geese were kept in packs, roaming hills or other pastures, often by herdsmen, often children and teenagers, similar to the well-known herds.
Dunnebunns were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although dunes were mainly made of parallel wooden dunes, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Rail thresholds were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place, but it gradually became apparent that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron rail on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wineries.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones.
The first known form of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Two-legged specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join an environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like a symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and we should address it.
It is obvious enough that the scientific and technological advances of mankind have greatly changed the world and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few pages further into the printer's John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets, of which we know to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document.
Today, few paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They had feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and stand on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are considered binary digits  or bits (to use computer language).
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as fractures are so common that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of an underlying poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
On the label you will find specific first aid instructions for the poison.
The term "kneecap" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the predatory bugs and the bed bugs are nest bugs, which have adapted to life in the nest or the habitat of their word.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the kidneys, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or that of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works through the scientific method. This method definitely guides most of the scientific research.
It does not do this alone, however, experimenting  and an experiment is a test used to possess one or more of the possible hypotheses  Asking questions and making observations are also part of the conduct of scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Rarely observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can continue to function for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-and-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a material that could be studied.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that either stripped the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or tagged the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Just mutations in stem cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can result in cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to work and drive past people whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems.
In industrialized countries, you may hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation planners simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the investigation of traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave in a uniformly consistent range; here traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be graphed mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were made between the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger cluster of small places to hide from predators.
Today, water fleas and day-old moths are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but few assumed otherwise; that the solar system would move around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on earth, at just under 6 miles (9.7 km) wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers around the world into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ale Kingdom, the size and technical performance of the construction of the Pyramids of Giseh were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
As early as the ancient world, humans were familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they can all be found in nature in natural form and can be degraded relatively easily with primitive history.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 aggregate states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma; although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are usually a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so surreally small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has become less important and used with the development of new writing methods.
People now type messages on computer screens and no longer need a stylus.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a massive wound pulling up a hill, and the re-division of the cell nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they break with little or no excitation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The coastline is about 70 km wide at the upper end and about 100 km wide at the lower end.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker over the highlands.
There may be more marshes on the closed side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on figuring out how people type or what they say.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they have come into adulthood.
This theory considers what happens to certain people who want the things they want, and what causes things in their environment to make them want or not want certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain 'one of the colleagues' (or colleagues).
This type of leadership has difficulties making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibility and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels like you have to change everything that the team has done, and you have to make it your own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the crew.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as spokespersons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet at the appropriate time zones, which is not necessarily understood by the local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible crew' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual crew.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each individual member reports.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively deployed in the functional areas of a business, creativity and wealth of choice can be expressed.
Here, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the requirements of customers.
For an organisation to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes continuous use as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with valuable information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI is a very important area of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on offering solutions to real problems.
AI systems are often used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, but are also built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions form a large part of every classroom. Often a schoolteacher would like to take his students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual excursions, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is a good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is rebuilt each year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a collector's album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with a little grammar and spelling, the awareness of an audience changes that in general.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to relate better to the world around them". The need to get the attention of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
By actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of comments from others and also emphasize their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is home to a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north lies the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka Mountains and beyond.
All of these things and more elevate Ontario above what foreigners consider to be typical Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison, which is surprising to many, there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries and it was a long way to Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that traveling women say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be harassed, to be grabbed in the arm, etc.
Don't be shy about rejecting men, and don't be afraid to assert yourself (cultural differences here or there, so it's not right either!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish traders who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old town of Medina you can easily find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tajins, Faiserie, leather goods, Hukaen and a wool of gegaens are sold, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the area of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should be monitored to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trips in Africa.
You can take a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get to Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a deprived city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the World Heritage List due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations during the PBS Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to a wide selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the area of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering balloon diagram, made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon Waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the town claimed by the British colonists, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove forest and extend from the coastline for over 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Forests are not just mangroves, however - they include some of the last remaining stocks of the massive jungles that once stretched across the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/supply areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a nature reserve and it is estimated that there are now 400 king tigers and over 30,000 moose in the area.
Buses run throughout the day from the Interdistrict Bus Station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east to Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 6.30 and 7.30 am.
Because the cross-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two 3.5 m wide footbridges.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres, the construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day Paraguay and were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Rising Province of India", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous indigenous group.
For the Spanish, the colonial era began, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on tours and where to buy tickets for polo games, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is commonly used throughout the islands and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted in the remote islands, although British and US currencies are accepted; check with the owners in advance as to which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange falconry outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer, winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures are usually above +30 degrees Celsius.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures barely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There is no specific "rain" and "dry" season: the rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although rare animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, one should keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wildlife and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
No matter what they look like, bison, elk, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so let them keep their distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong foods and keep the storage clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous 1889 naval skirmish when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the assassination of the top leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches around Auckland's two harbours, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most provide shade through Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour in the residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family streets with a good selection of shops along the coast.
There are two local beers, the most important being 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but rather a welcomed and invigorating one; the other is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that you should try, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be easier to get.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but mineral water is easy to find if you're not sure.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is exotic. A short black means 'espresso', cappuccino has a top-drop shot (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot cocoa is Belgian standard. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, ask the authorities for advice, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, watermelons have been found on beaches and estuaries from October to April, sometimes even outside of that time.
Sharks do, but they bite people's souls. Most sharks are afraid of people and would go away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If booked in advance, the traveler can rest assured that he will be able to sleep in the same place when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have deals for certain hotels, although you may be able to book other amenities such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include coffee, transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer again or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most music festival participants choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right in the moment, you have to get up early to get a campsite next to the music.
Note that even though the music on the main stage closes at the end, there may still be areas of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the passage of ice can cause quite horrible commotion for the most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Casinos usually work hard to maximize time spent and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings to keep guests entertained and on the ground.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but alcohol challenges judgment and any good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On dirt and snow roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were driving on Makadam.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to keep you stuck.
The visibility may also be limited by falling or blown snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic is generally unhindered throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland journeys to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars closely and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you see them better with a perspective.
A walking safari (also known as a bushwalk, hiking safari, or walking safari) consists of hikes, lasting several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tight spot.
Cancellation conditions vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation guidelines do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Wet cloths can help dry them out. Many hotels have a treadmill and a treadmill that can be borrowed even when you are not in the room.
If stretchers are not available, or you do not feel like wearing stretched stockings, you can try using a strap if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause it to break or in extreme cases cause burns).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different efficiency, and if you should be concerned, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests in their home regions that they are not familiar with.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods at certain places that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers who visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often runs through remote woodlands.
If you are used to walking on country roads, keep your sins together: go up steep slopes, narrow alleys and sharp roads.
The speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  usually 56  64 km/h (35  40 mph)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
However, mobile phone service is much stronger here than on other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common; apples are baked year-round and cakes and cherries and quince are added in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you're looking for a small but rich pastry shop, try what's on offer depending on the region, such as Berliner, pancakes or crab cakes.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can vary depending on the liquid content from "dry" to "into a sauce".
In the northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the nation.
When used without further qualification, however, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the predominant flavors of Javanese cuisine being cacao, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The rider's legs are supported by a rope and hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can cause safety concerns because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is struck by a horse but a foot remains stuck in the stirrup, he may be pulled over if the horse runs away.
First, all riders wear riding boots with a talley and a smooth, rather narrow, sole.
Next, some suede, especially English suede, has safety pins that allow a climbing rim to fall off the suede if left behind by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley  Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with rare large granite walls and rocks.
Some offer breathtaking views from the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are finding new routes between the walls' infinite potential.
Descending sports, which include boating and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain with a foot-mounted ski or a snowboard.
Boating is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally called "boat fans", planning their entire holidays around boating in a particular location.
The idea of sailing is very old - cave paintings depicting sailors date back to around 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport date back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called tour boat, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but not usually associated with alpine hiking or mountain climbing, the latter of which takes place on rough terrain and requires much steeper skiing and footwear.
Think of the ski trail as a parallel hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than on foot, but you rarely reach the speed of running without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean making several visa applications and passing through passport controls.
The Schengen area functions in this respect similarly to a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa you do not have to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes handmade objects as antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with the age limit in countries such as North America being lower than in Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques, although they are younger than actual mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the seeds and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, not all seeds were involved in reindeer farming on a large scale, but lived off fishing, hunting, and other activities, and reindeer were largely kept as breeding animals.
Today, many seeds are produced by modern craftsmen.
Although widespread, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and the lack of awareness of Roma.
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to a travel warning, this may affect your travel sickness or retirement insurance.
You may want to accept the advice of other governments as well as your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might be faced with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is no more than a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, generic and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information otherwise available.
In addition, the term is used to describe any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Thunderstorms can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types that can vary depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of storms such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are often advised to be aware of the dangers of weather that may occur in their area, as they can affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for 'environmentally hostile course' will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, and is usually combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing games and lots of First Aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who plan to change their gender abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or updated documents to reflect a last name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents varies widely.
Security checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to pass the scanner and remain intact in their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the reverse currents of waves that break on the beach, often at a reef or reef edge.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in some deeper sections and a rapid current can form in the deep water.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue while trying to swim backwards against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to get to places where you can't get back, or depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, it may be tempting to wait for rescue.
The withdrawal shock occurs earlier and, like culture shock (has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be difficult.
Travelers who have been able to adapt easily to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to adjust to their native culture again.
When you return home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.
When you first went to a foreign country, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be needed for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you hear the chatter of tourists and traders. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is considered the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge here with the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, also called the Sentinel Range, the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, are located, with Mount Vinson as the highest point at 4,892 m (14,029 ft).
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally no substitute for a mobile phone, as one must be outdoors, with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by shipping, including sport boats, as well as expeditions that require external data and language recognition.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you further information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year abroad is to travel and study.
This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling for a year abroad can actually improve your chances of higher education when you return home.
There are usually tuition fees for enrolling in these study programmes.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has several thousand islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to get to the archipelago and the sea.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats or simply a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland with a boat for seven to eight people.
This is found in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite unique elsewhere (e.g. the number in the Netherlands is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruise lines offer extended stays in St. Petersburg (Russia).
This means you can visit the historic city for a few days while sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only travel by boat, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises are labeled with Berlin (Germany) in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, however, Berlin is not located by the sea and the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
You are not to be ashamed of anything, but to be in subjection to the same fear and anxiety that many others have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear of the unknown or of not having control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often time is critical for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the largest companies had their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, it became a problem.
If they were shipping things by air freight, it may have taken several days on the routes before everything was unloaded and passed through customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines' regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger and that's where you come in.
The obvious thing about the option of flying first or business class is that you have to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, let your company pay for it for you).
But it's not cheap: As a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times as much as business class and 11 times as much as first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a core of air travelers who are willing to pay big bucks for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably and demand it accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties were re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good traffic junction.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is today a modern, developed and busy commercial center, surrounded by mountains and a large bay.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more European Mediterranean atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an exceptional octagonal church.

To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous to foreigners after a celebratory display of its grandeur recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you must also visit the important sanctuary of Fátima (shrine), a world-famous site for Marian apparitions.
Remember, you're essentially visiting a mass grave, a site that has almost incalculable significance to another part of the world's population.
Many men and women still live here, and many more have been killed or have been killed there, Jews and Gentiles alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, courtesy and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching the structures with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population speaks Catalan, a very large part understands it and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced through an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often a controversial stereotype, the best way to get to Paris is still to show your best side and behave like a "bien élevée" (well-bred) person.
The sudden appearance of the Parisians fades quickly if you are a little polite.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests  mainly beech, fir and fir  and features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably large diversity of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely large diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, eagle, lynx, wild goose and heron can be found there, along with many other species.
During the visit of the cemeteries, women must wear skirts that extend over the knees, and also cover their heads.
Most cloisters provide a welcome for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a colorful one, you will be greeted with a smile from the man or the nun at the entrance.
So men have to win boxes that go over the knees.
You may also borrow from the market a pair of sandals, but do not wash them after each use, or else you may be ashamed of wearing them. These are men's size.
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and is all olive oil.
A simple popular evening meal, especially in summer, is the Pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and all available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All capital letters next to the word 'you' for 'you' always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a very important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also simplifies reading, although writing is a bit complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Also, make sure you emphasize 'r' and 'rr' differently: 'caro' means 'love', but 'carro' means 'car'.
Persian has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Thus, reading this grammar reference book would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak little Spanish may conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain preserved as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution was not as much of a problem in its heyday as it is today, they were usually located in cities or on campuses and were easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where pomegranates were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom festival just for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formal lit garden, you will also be left out without discussion if you collect "specimens".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to live, and very easy to navigate and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But because it's in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more soles).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Banana water strays can be a good theme to plan a vacation around.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at an exposed point to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil during Easter weekend samschdes, with communities often celebrating the Resurrection of Christ at the point of midnight.
All animals originally brought to the island were either swum, drifted or drifted.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant clawed frog the first weaver in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in the winter, you experience the Arctic night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and more formal than those that Westerners are accustomed to.
Costumes are standard business attire and employees call each other by their surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their supervisor's consent for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their supervisor's instructions without question.
