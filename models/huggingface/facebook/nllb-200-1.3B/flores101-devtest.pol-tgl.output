This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional patterns, which you can't get from fossils.
According to scientists, the animal's plumage was chestnut on top, and light or carotene underneath.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed trunk, called a stosinum, but have other feather features rays and prominences, the researchers concluded that the stosinum was probably a later evolutionary stage than these other features.
The feather structure indicates that they were not used for flight, but for temperature control or for display, and scientists believe that this is the feather of an adult, not a chick, even though the tail was that of a young dinosaur.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the tail of the specimen indicates an adult, not a chick.

When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
The call goes to a satellite in space, and then it bounces back almost immediately.
The satellite was taken into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes placed in outer space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light, and so the image seen from Earth.
To send a satellite or a telescope into space requires the use of a huge rocket at over 100 feet.

When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when moving over a mountain range or a river or if moving to a new island, without the possibility of easy retreat), it is often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new characteristics or adapt in a way that they can compete effectively in their new environment.
The original population hasn't changed a bit and still has to adapt.
As the new population adapts to the new environment, they become less and less like the other populations.
After all, thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different from each other that it's going to be hard to call them one species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable outcome of evolution and a very important part of it.

There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, all male candidates were given free access to the professions, so that those who showed the greatest ambition and ingenuity could succeed.
The same goes for the military, because the rankings of armies that used to be class-based are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working class in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life. He often went to contemplate the cave known as Hira on MountNo (Mountain of Light).
The cave itself gives a very colourful idea of the spiritual predilections of Muhammad.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's not easy to find it, even if someone knows it exists. Inside the cave, the visitor is in absolute isolation.
You can't see anything except the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, you can't see or hear much of the outside world.
The only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the 3rd century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids erected in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau (also known as the Giza Necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
up symbol looks like the letter V and down symbol looks like a button or a square without a bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and you press the loop, and down means you start at the frog (this is where the hand holds the loop) and you pull the loop.
The lower-up movement of the loop produces a softer sound, and the up-down movement produces a louder, more determined sound.

The crowd of bribes forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and Elizabeth, the king's sister, to return from Versailles to Paris.
As the king and queen returned to Paris in their carriage, they were accompanied by an angry mob, who threatened them.
The angry butterfly forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a person in the crowd waved his head at the guard who was killed in Versailles right in front of the terrified queen.
The imperialist United States' war expenses for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds being floated on behalf of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.

The context in which the Templar Order was founded is important to understand its specificity.



Most interpretations of technological determinism combine two general principles: first, the process of technological development itself is not subject to cultural or political factors, and second, technology generates effects in societies that are immanent rather than socially conditioned.
You could say, for example, that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of the road network.
Since the national road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is negligible, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of running the vehicle.
The development of new ways of repairing damaged bodies.
Romance included an important element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of such authors as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the individual was shaped by geography, and over time, customs and culture associated with geography developed, so well suited to the place of society that they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.

The city's reputation as a luxury sanctuary began around 400 C.E. and lasted until 1000 C.E.


Gothic reached its peak in the 11th and 14th centuries.


Through the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to shape its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of the time, as a consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-employed farming means that a farmer produces enough food to meet his and his family's needs.
self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system using self-sustaining seed from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods to maximise yield.

Subculture attracts people who have similar beliefs about the world, people who feel that social norms don't meet their needs, people who find a sense of identity within a subculture.
Subcultures are different in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.

If you're a member of a subculture, you show it through a distinctive and symbolic style that incorporates fashion, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most popular ways of showing the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during adolescence either because of neglect, unhappiness or intentional exploitation.
wild orwild, some were imprisoned (usually by parents) and some were abandoned because parents were unable to accept their child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or fled, wild children may have suffered from trauma or abuse.
It is thought that others have raised animals, and some are said to live in the wild by themselves.
If a wild child is cared for only by animals, he behaves almost entirely (including physical limitations) like these animals, showing fear or indifference to humans.
project method should make learning easier and more attractive, whereas scaffolding goes a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a way of learning, but rather a support provided to individuals who are participating in new learning experiences, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, so the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Mr. Spinach in MS Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is designed to question, hint and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to understand on his/her own.
children are placed in surrogate care for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even bullying.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that doesn't provide for him or her, care and education, but unfortunately that's what happens.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our surrogacy system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and good medical care.
The foster family is supposed to meet any needs that weren't met in the home they were taken from.
Internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet are opening up new dimensions in terms of how people use and approach gratification.
Science andconnections are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement andpermanent relationships were also identified by Eighemey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience reactions to websites.
video recordings have made important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, or facial muscular movements that last for only a few milliseconds.

The President's Speech (The President's Speech), Oliver Sacks argues that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to correctly judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have the same ability to interpret human behavior.
Scientific research over the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation one hidden and the other expressed.
mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes the variation from the pool of expressed genes.
The two pools exchange their variability with each generation by segregation and recombination.
The plants that grow on the savannah have a hard time allowing primates with digestive systems like ours to meet the body's demand for amino acids.
Plus, if you don't do this, you can have serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to get are the proteins in leaves and stems, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest without cooking.
The difference is that animal food (anth, termites, eggs) is easily digested and provides high amounts of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.

interruption of sleep is the deliberate awakening during normal sleep and falling back to sleep after 1060 minutes.
It's not hard to do when you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness, but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you find yourself shifting your watch while you're sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods recommend drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is diuretic) before bedtime to get you up to urinate.
The level of inner peace is inversely proportional to the inner and physical tension of the person.
The less stress, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
anyone can achieve enlightenment. only our own tension and negativity can stop us.

It was to last for the next 40 years and include real battles fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.


transporting goods by ship is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of goods and people across the oceans.
The Navy's job has always been to provide the nation with the ability to transport people and goods, while preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
The North Atlantic Campaign during World War II was one of the most remarkable examples in recent history. To help the British, the Americans tried to move men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.

Goat domestication probably took place in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.

Goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often guarded by shepherd-like goat-chasers, who were usually children or teenagers. These breeding methods are still used.

Though the railroad tracks were built on parallel wooden planks, the horses could travel faster and carry larger loads than on the busy roads of the time.
The railway rails were relatively early in their development, but it was gradually realized that to increase the efficiency of the tracks, iron strips were needed.
This became a popular practice, but iron made it more expensive to use wooden wagon wheels.
Then the wooden wheels were replaced by iron, and in 1767 the railings were made entirely of iron.
The earliest known way to move was by walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, hence the term Homo erectus.
The Australopithecus, their ancestors, did not walk upright.
Forms of bipedalism can be found in Australopithecus fossils dated to 4.23.9 million years ago, although it is not excluded that Sahelantropus moved on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

This is often a symptomatic treatment, but rather than being a temporary solution, it is important to identify the source of the problem and eliminate it.

When the Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten version signed by John Hancock, President of Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
Dunlap broadsides, was printed in the night.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered it read to his troops on July 9 in New York.
25 Dunlap bulbs are the oldest copies of the document that have survived.

The name worm is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient times, when bugs were foreign to them, insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both insect bugs and house bugs are nesting bugs, adapted to live in the nest or in the host's home.
United States has about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the most common neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
SMS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may decide to prepare an adoption plan for their child.
adoption is where the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can be the parents of the child.
The overriding goal of science is to discover the mechanism of the world through the scientific method, which is the basis for most scientific research.

The classical texts, especially the Latin Bible, have been the basis for the study of naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotelis's ideas have been adopted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
much of the observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend essentially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
The use of a cyclic rhythm, which is not just a response to external periodic stimuli, has been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that last for cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
two experiments were done, one marking the DNA in the flask with radioactive phosphorus, and the other marking the flask protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary depending on the type, the significance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to the children; mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in exploring natural areas, admiring landscapes, including flora and fauna.



In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is participating in some way in the private vehicle transport system and the system supports it.
Today, science shows that the massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of its normal state, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is a social participant and uses transportation.

Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why are there malfunctions in their operation every day? Are the engineers responsible for them, are they just the groundskeepers? Or is the problem much deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
You can't predict the behavior of drivers with absolute certainty, so unfortunately, studying traffic flow is a little bit difficult.
Thanks to the fact that drivers behave in a generally consistent way, the traffic flows also show some consistency and can be approximated by mathematical calculations.
The relationships between the three key characteristics, namely (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed, make it possible to better visualize traffic.
Planing, design and operation of road facilities use this type of relationship.
Insects were the first animals to soar in the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the useful ability to fold their wings along their trunk.
Then they have a wider choice of little hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that do not have the ability to fold their wings are the weasels and the jets.

The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, stretching nearly 6 miles in places.
Amazon is responsible for 20% of the rivers that feed the oceans on Earth.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.

The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with admiration upon the buildings of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent state in the world, and the least populous.




The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a combination of at least one to four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter in concentration (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized about how these could be turned into new substances that shape what we see.
Alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals.You have to remember that the periodic table contains a lot of elements.
Calcium and potassium are considered to be metals, and of course silver and gold are also metals.
The use of a metallic alloy is not recommended.
Toda la materia del universo está formada por pequeñas partículas llamadas átomos.
The atom is so incredibly microscopic that the dot at the end of this problem would contain trillions of them.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to a lot of people.

People are now writing messages using computer screens and they don't need tempers at all.
You can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to connect the nucleus with many protons and neurons.
like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that break down with or without a small impact.
The surface of the moon is covered with rocks and dust. The outer layer of the planet is called the crust.
The cover is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the moon's seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the visible side, there may be more areas of maria, because the shell thickness is smaller here and the lava was easier to penetrate to the surface.
content theorists focus on finding what people respond to and appeal to.
Theories of development assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired in the process of maturing into adulthood.

This behavior often results in friction between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence, but there are slight differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for a physical group directly related to them.
They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can organize meetings in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
(Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
Invisible group is a management team to which all members are subject.Invisible group sets standards for each member.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the goals of implementing the concept of a learning organisation is to be innovative.
creativity and ingenuity flourish when all available resources are used efficiently in functional departments of the organisation.
As a result, collaboration within the organisation to overcome the obstacle can lead to the creation of an innovative process that meets the needs of the customers.
To be innovative, an organisation's management must create a culture of innovation, sharing knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organisations achieve higher performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and this narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supported by ongoing research.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumour affect behaviour and lead to alterations in mental function.

We're getting a lot of information and material from this to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what's going on in the human mind.
Although AI is closely associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research is about building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
examples include: control and planning, the ability to respond to customer statements and questions, and the ability to recognize handwriting, voice and facial characteristics.
These things have become separate fields, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI is now widely used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military technology, and is also embedded in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
