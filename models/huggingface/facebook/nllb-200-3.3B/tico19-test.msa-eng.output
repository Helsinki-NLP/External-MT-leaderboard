Cumulative incidence of rapidly increasing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, although the severity varies by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italian experience, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will require health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the disease was a new coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progressed to a more severe illness and required hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases developed critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we examined the cumulative incidence trends of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to the incidence in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 has experienced a much wider geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently following the pandemic dynamics in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with a confirmed case of COVID-19 based on the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 inclusive, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting the cumulative numbers and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported by each country worldwide is updated daily at 8:00 a.m. These numbers are obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data was used to assess the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as to compare them with trends in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we counted the cumulative incidence of 14 days, thus accounting for the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, in the period 1 January15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported by country as of 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian cases during the period 31 January  15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and UK as a whole, cumulative COVID-19 incidence began to increase around 21 February, then sharply increased around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This trend is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK are showing a similar trend of cumulative COVID-19 incidence increases (Supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
The data highlight that, as of 15 March at 08:00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases that is comparable to the total number of cases in Italy three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rising rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence indicate that the pandemic is increasing at comparable rates in all countries.
This is despite the differences in the level of exposure between countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region described the situation as one where around 10% of COVID-19 patients require intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on COVID-19 admissions to hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EEA level are only available for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focused on the number of reported cases and deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and intensive care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
Modelling scenarios related to health care capacity saturation, with estimated prevalence of inpatient COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA country and the UK associated with a risk of >90% exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases are clustered in certain regions in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a population of a certain regional service coverage, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be provided at the level of the Regional Unit Designation for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the scenario of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As demonstrated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, because the rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, and adapt an appropriate response if it is not applied earlier.
The rapid risk assessment also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity as countries have the possibility to further enhance their containment efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the burden on healthcare.
If it fails, other EU/EEA countries' healthcare systems are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a human catastrophe.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted from bats and caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Despite this, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality rates than SARS, but is more contagious and more prevalent in the elderly than the young, and more in men than in women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on these emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of a rapidly growing research subject.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this survey will help in understanding and eradicating this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were ordered to stay home during the holiday and for several weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new virus disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients being discharged and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warned that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and has the potential to do more damage than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 that established the virus sequence isolated from several patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review attempts to summarise the research progress in this rapidly expanding new subject area.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-induced diseases, namely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease and some other unanswered, but pressing questions.
Traditionally, CoVs have been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of colds.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have found two highly pathogenic human co-viruses twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing an outbreak that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with horrendous morbidity and mortality.
As such, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in FIG. 1.1, a pneumonia cluster of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On 20 January, a health care provider infection was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On 23 January, a regional quarantine was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transport was stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients who had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market were considered to be the initial site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).2).
As the situation evolves so rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
As of 11 February 2020, a multicenter study in 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presents the following more updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but mainly at ages 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, only a few were under 20 years old, and only 14 infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to infect males (0.31/100.000) than females (0.27/100.000).
COVID-19 is spreading in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from conception to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected rose exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large subfamily of sampled viruses that contain a single strand of sense RNA.
CoVs can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
The spike (S) glycoprotein of the sample binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA is joined by the sample glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein to form a virion-containing vesicle, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was first reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity among 10 samples sequenced; the samples were taken from the original location of the outbreak, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in a very thin part of the human respiratory tract epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than it does to the S-protein of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as severe as SARS-CoV infections in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded by orf3b and proteins secreted by orf8.
The protein orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human ACE2 cryo-EM structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has an open and closed conformation, is composed of dimers and the complex ACE2-B0AT1 is able to bind to two S proteins, which is evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in the filtering of drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother origin and intermediate
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are each transmitted to humans via foxes and camels.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the native host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al. proposed the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans involving recombination of homologs in the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that tenggilis, a long-snouted ant-eating mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine, could potentially be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on the 99% genetic homology of the CoV found in tenggilis and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across the genome is still a large difference; therefore, a conclusive result as concrete evidence has yet to be obtained (Fig. 3).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively inactivated the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include the C-type lectin-like receptor, the Toll-like receptor (TLR), the NOD-like receptor (NLR), and the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) that limits viral spread and accelerates phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus evade the immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play a crucial role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies against the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill directly infected cells.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cell.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complement, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies is also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from a cured patient neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive immune system reaction produces large amounts of locally produced free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, compound organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by clusters of plaques, is more prevalent in elderly with conjunctival disease and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of infection than others.
Estimates of the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 are 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, show that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate incubation period to prevent infected, but asymptomatic, people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to a virus or are infected are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without accompaniment of other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, phlegm, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's disease progresses rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms and fever, even without abnormal imaging of the lungs, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, namely a study of family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients required ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with a higher MERS lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, the mortality rate for SARS in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
The figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as much as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Clustered carriers are often found in a single family or from a group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the outbreak.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again.
In the early stages, patients have normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell (specifically lymphocyte) counts.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes a lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Increased levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood clotting rate were observed in most patients.
In severe cases, the D-dimer levels increase, the breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, and the lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
Photo-abnormalities of the thorax are found in the majority of COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral clouded shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbate the gas exchange disorder.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction decreases surfactant levels and increases surface pressure, thus decreasing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings on chest X-rays often parallel the most severe stage of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte desquamation, formation of the hyaline membrane, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multiple-stranded senescial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with similar pathologies of viral infections and ARDS as well as with pathological analysis of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurs in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and a must for making an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group described the protocol for the use of CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipping pen in less than an hour without requiring complex instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, physicians mainly offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying out a range of previously used or proposed therapies for the treatment of other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).2).
These therapies include current and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients is being proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies raced to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening respiratory illness.
In addition, care of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ function are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals which are the main cause of ARDS and compound organ failure.
Immunosuppression is very important in the management of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to address cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of the T cell-directed immune response; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; suppression of cytokine 4 signaling; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are useless for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affects the prognosis.
However, short-term administration of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses is recommended with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antiviral therapy had been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single-stranded RNA viruses, which included the MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided this compound to China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medications that the patient is taking should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and the manufacture of antibodies
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
Indeed, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
An antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, recognizing the unique molecules in the pathogen, and immediately neutralizing them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation and viral load and an increase in blood oxygen saturation.
However, verification and clarification is needed to submit the method to large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Further, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some of the drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause a cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and large amounts are needed in plasma to treat critically ill patients.
Developing and producing specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from a recovered patient and identify the genetic code that detects effective antibodies or to perform effective antibody filtering against proteins that are essential for the virus.
This way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula. These formulas vary depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, as effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not exist, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest cure rate in the therapy of COVID-19 patients was observed in some provinces of China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, which includes Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only around 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine therapy (WM) alone with combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time it took for the body temperature to recover, the symptoms to disappear, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptom worsening (mild to severe) was much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM alone group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM alone group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still pending better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting point is to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients feel extremely fearful of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those quarantined also feel bored, lonely, and angry.
Furthermore, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as therapeutic side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which included depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor disorders, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were reported.
Contact history tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspects, and their contacts, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with routine and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with one another.
Effective vaccines are critical to breaking the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts and often serve as complementary antiviral therapies in controlling epidemics caused by the emergence of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop an S-protein-based vaccine, which long-term and effectively creates penetrating antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, a live-inhibited vaccine has been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the elderly and lethal challenge models and its protection against zoonotic viral infections is yet to be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic and cluster cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, these difficulties are not easily overcome due to the long time to develop a vaccine (average 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the formation of disease prognosis models is crucial for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was predominantly in the age group 30-65 years with 47.7% of patients aged over 50 years in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care tend to have a higher incidence of comorbidities and complications and are significantly older than patients not requiring intensive care (median age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to experience acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events also represented the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are highly correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
A correlation between CRP rate and severity and COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the final result.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Thoracic imaging and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other factors to predict the end result and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive the disease eventually suffer from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered from extreme stress as they had to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or asymptomatic symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of virus during daily activities, which poses great difficulties to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is believed to occur when the patient is critically ill and mostly does not occur in the early phase.
As such, the current COVID-19 outbreak is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, a major effort is underway in China, covering the quarantine of Wuhan province and surrounding cities as well as the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of ending transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have been very damaging to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new cases is declining, which indicates a slowing of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates indicate that the outbreak will end in March and the phase of decline will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. developed a model to predict the end result of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A group of Canadian researchers reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-conch and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the re-identified virus could be a recurrent episode, similar to influenza.
Nevertheless, promising signs are occurring in China, if viewed in terms of declining numbers of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may be successful.
Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases and half as many deaths.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is also possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakened its ability to infect and eventually disappeared or became a less pathogenic virus that could coexist with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Fig. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in faeces, raising the possibility of a new form of transmission, called faeces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be due to nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even people who happen to be in contact with a patient or an infected person.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serial number 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent potentially infected people from spitting into the air or sticking to surfaces where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions being fully penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both measuring about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, health care providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (serial number 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear translucent face shields or goggles while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home to self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet is believed to be the proper distance to keep the patient away.
These measures are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should be a major warning for China which has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the public by saying that the new virus has low transmissibility and limited human-to-human reproductive capacity and that prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
This message soothed the public's fears, especially as the entire state was preparing for the Spring Festival, that this critical time was too late to contain the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The Chinese disease control agency should learn from this and make big improvements in the future.
For example, the agency should (1) be more careful in making public announcements because every word is observed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorized officers; (3) be more restrictive in curbing the potential of epidemics in the early stages, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) issue targeted and effective exercises more often in order to raise public awareness of the epidemic and test and improve community response systems periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak is caused by a novel virus SARS-CoV-2 that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, COVID-19 outbreaks have had the same effect as recurrent SARS outbreaks.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial to contain the epidemic and manage the patients.
COVID-19 is more common in older people than in younger people and more common in men than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in older people than in younger people.
The mortality rate of SARS was higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are critically ill.This makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains part of the reason SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can test positive for the virus again.
This finding greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues remain to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the 96% genetic homology found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal is the intermediate species for transmitting the virus from the original host, say a bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers one and two, we can't effectively interrupt the transmission and the outbreak could re-emerge at any moment.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays show that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and result in subsequent pathological changes?
Does this virus also bind to ACE2 expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does a virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic become a worldwide pandemic, end like SARS, or recur periodically like the flu?
The answers to these questions and many others are very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible so that we can return to normal life.
Zoonotic origin of the human corona virus
Over thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human co-viruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation and revealed how highly destructive and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought the CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with its high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity than its sibling, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections are zoonosis. Therefore, understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will be beneficial to us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, in which the virus is not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs have also been identified.
Identification of host animals has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
Research on CoV-animal interactions may also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current knowledge on the seven HCoV, with a focus on their history of discovery as well as their zoonotic origin and their interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted the HCoVs from the evolutionary and recombination genomic perspective.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host transition and the implications of viral evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are from the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of single-stranded, positively-combined, single-stranded RNA viruses.
It has the largest genome size of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoVs", due to its crown-like morphology under electron microscopy.
Based on its structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that have similar arrangement.
About two-thirds of the genome is composed of two overlapping large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), both of which are translated into the replicating polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes the spike (S), the sheath (E), the membrane (M), and the nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complementary proteins specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoVs and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Philogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while poultry are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and having a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside of the pulmonary organs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the throat of a patient with a cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, it was widely accepted that HCoV infections were generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in recent history, infecting over 8,000 people with a gross mortality rate of around 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a sustained epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), hereinafter referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
Alarms are already sounding and the world should prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all had zoonotic origins in bats, mice, or domestic animals.
There is ample evidence to support the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats.In bats, CoVs are well adapted and nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed an unusually large medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge to China and the world.
The zoonotic origin of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motivation, and limiting factors of interspecies transmission.
The study could also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir, intermediate, and amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications in the prevention of future spread.
In this review, we provide an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
We specifically highlight and discuss the general topic that the parent virus HCoV is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also commented on the evolutionary trend of HCoVs that increased transmissibility is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal coVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 from the throat of a patient infected with influenza, various CoVs had been isolated from a variety of infected animals, which included turkey, rat, cattle, pig, cat, and dog.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of a patient with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be grown in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibit common cold symptoms, which include headache, sneezing, lethargy, and sore throat, accompanied by fever and cough seen in 10~20% of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequencing pathways in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears similar to infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread globally and tend to be transmitted most during winter in temperate regions.
Typically, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week and is followed by a period of illness for about two weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems showed severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from super contagious, each case is estimated to cause around two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load seen by the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, lethargy, and chills, followed by dyspnea, coughing, and breathing difficulties as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated creatinine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and macrophage enlargement were also observed in SARS patients.
Further, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal, especially in patients with weakened immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of patient zero who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a huge amount of effort has been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients suffering from respiratory illness.
Choriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explained the isolation of the same virus from nasal specimens of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus has actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and its peak incidence occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbations of acute asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
These four HCoVs of the community have all adapted to humans and generally have a low chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, such as in the case of the more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtype that was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally, when the ability to efficiently migrate and persist in humans is acquired, the virulence and pathogenicity of these HCoVs is reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also suffered acute renal failure, which has so far only occurred in MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
Over 30% of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported with a high case fatality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most feared viruses known to man.
In mid-to-late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Note that the case fatality in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while the case fatality outside Hubei was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a profile of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology, at 82%, they are grouped into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects have been reported and may have contributed to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and differentiating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals both similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a more general pattern seen in community HCoV infections, which includes a pattern of mild or even asymptomatic nonspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small fraction of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections although at a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also exhibits an interesting pattern characteristic, having similarities with both community HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community HCoVs.
On the other hand, the non-decreasing transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 after several strains in humans still needs to be verified, as was the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a faeces sample.
"Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, remains to be clarified by further studies".
It is also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoV.
However, the picture of SARS-CoV-2, which includes its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustained spread in multiple pathways in humans, will have a significant impact on the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four community HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoVs and humans may be the surviving species of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that experience severe HCoV disease have been eradicated.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient numbers to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations to counteract the host's limiting factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs have circulated in the human population and triggered sepsis in immunocompetent people.
This virus does not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and their transmission in humans is unlikely.
They must both defend themselves and reproduce in zoonotic reservoirs as well as seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar profile to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible like community HCoVs, at least for now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and is not pathogenic to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplification hosts of HCoVs.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoVs if they have closely related ancestors and share high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
Ancestral viruses are usually well-adapted and nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, reservoir hosts carry HCoVs continuously and over long periods of time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts for the HCoV or parent virus.
On the other hand, if a new HCoV enters an intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
These intermediate hosts can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can undergo a stagnant infection if they cannot sustain transmission in an intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that the zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with game animals.
Further seroprevalence studies indicate that these pet sellers have a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Moon lizards (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were the first to be identified as carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that was almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS have been reported since all the ferrets in the market were killed.
However, it was reported that the wild or farm-raised foxes not exposed to the live animal market largely tested negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the fox may only act as an intermediate amplifying host, but not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market possess anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that it is possible that many small mammal species also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these hosts appear to be end hosts of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called Rhinolopus-related bat CoV SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horsehair bats.
The bat tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study became the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts for emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, has been isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat faeces samples was shown to use bat, fox, and human ACE2 as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of a convalescent SARS patient was able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high degree of homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct host virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and the bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidylated peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the entry route for the virus.
The sequence of MERS-CoV-dependent RNA polymerase-RNA is phylogenetically closer to its counterpart in the bat beta-CoV identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative the bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be direct reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the Arabian camel is seropositive to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, similar to the camels native to the Middle East in some African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swab of the Arabian camel.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with mild symptoms is usually observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the faecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral excretion from bats.
However, questions remain unanswered as many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be direct reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless a near-identical bat CoV is found later.
It is likely that intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.Many early cases of COVID-19 were linked to this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a group of endangered small mammals, known as the pangolins (Manis javanica), may also carry an ancestral beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of this new Trangolin CoV shares 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with that of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with 90% similarity in nucleotide sequence levels.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like virus sub-lines in the phylogenetic tree, one sharing a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Notably, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much more distinct, although the level of sequence-wide homology is higher.
Previous studies in sick troglytes also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turned out to be also related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different compiling and manual curation methods to produce a partial genome sequence consisting of about 86.3% of the complete virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of the pangolin as one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from dengue due to the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and dengue-related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and its cousin beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals is yet to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the whole-genome sequence level.
It is too speculative to say that the high degree of similarity between the RBD beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 of the crested-throat type and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
A counter hypothesis supports recombination between the related beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 in the thresher and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As a driving factor of evolution, recombination occurs widely among beta-CoVs.
Researchers are still unable to conclude on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American trilobites shows close affinity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, current knowledge of the known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from livestock to infect humans, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
A bat-alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E has been discovered.
Among them, there is alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have come into contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, the bat alpha-CoV that is related to HCoV-229E is heterogeneous and nonpathogenic in bats, while the alpaca alpha-CoV causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca acquiring the alpha-CoV relative-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is that while the bat alpha-CoV serves as the gene for HCoV-229E, alpaca and camel may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at the initial identification of the virus and was also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rich viral species compartment for interspecies genetic fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, tightly organized colonies, close social interactions, and strong flight abilities are all conditions that favor the bat as an ideal 'spreader of viruses'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the Arabian camel for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable, natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Sporadic transmission to humans occurs by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV because transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of thrips, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the beta-CoV of the dengue is highly pathogenic in dengue.
The wasp may be the final host for the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV, similar to the wasp in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be considered or ruled out.
First, bats may be reservoir hosts for a SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplification hosts for the newly introduced SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
Humans get the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys on pets and wildlife should be done.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that comes into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different animal host types, three major factors from the viral side are also important for facilitating the CoV's crossing the species barrier.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered medium to high with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per site, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the new host.
CoVs have exoribonuclease correction, deletion that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir is known to inhibit CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutation of the CoV is about a million times higher than the rate of mutation of its host.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when the CoV has not yet adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation with humans.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also the case for MERS-CoV which has adapted to the Arabian camel.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will quickly render vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genomes in CoVs give extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are suitable.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frames and protein functions that are encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change their template randomly during RNA replication through a unique "select-salin" mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing vessels, strand transitions often occur during CoV RNA transcription.
Complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs can undergo recombination to form new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-infected interactions in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a special case, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and feral SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is suspected of undergoing rapid adaptation in a variety of hosts, particularly by mutation in the RBD protein S.
Generally, the RBD protein S of CoVs interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely targeted to the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its corresponsive receptors as a viral entryway.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptor of various animals, which includes bats, ferrets, mice, and raccoon dogs, thus allowing for interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human and wasp virus isolates in RBD and 4 of them were located on the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV has mutations in its RBDs K479N and S487T, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the bulk protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptors as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S units implies that the protein S binding affinity with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed that the binding affinity of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein is 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also important to know if there are other receptors that may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different portion on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E and 9-O-teracetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after interspecies transmission from its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also governed by other host dependencies and limitations.
These host protein differences between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over the host-dependent factor and break the host-constraining factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in the field of this important virus-parasite interaction have yet to be identified and characterized.
An unbiased whole-genome screening to look for the dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 hosts using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be of benefit.
The emergence of a new HCoV: back to the beginning of the epidemic
Bat CoV diversity provides a large window of opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the bat CoV serves as the HCoV gene pool.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein-coding gene has the potential to drastically modify the viral phenotype.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because isolated SARS-CoV-related bat virus was found to encode a diverse ORF8 protein.
SARS-CoV with the characteristic 29-nucleotide deletion was found in strains isolated early in human epidemics.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombination regions identified in RNA polymerase-dependent RNA.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the incidence of recombination between different lineages was shown to be ongoing in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in the Arabian camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs have recombined with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes in the viral genome, most likely caused by the release of the virus from the selection stress experienced, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 was observed in the bat and camel viruses that are related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV exhibited single nucleotide insertions resulting in skeletal displacement.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressures in their reservoir hosts.
Mild or no symptoms are detected when bats are infected with CoV, indicating an inter-adaptation between CoV and bats.
It seems that bats are well adapted to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats would efficiently decrease the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cell receptor and low expression levels of the class I major histocompatibility complex molecule.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high metabolic activity of bats can suppress CoV replication and influence correction by exoribonucleases thus providing selection pressure for the manufacture of highly pathogenic viral strains as they enter a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoVs may also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
CoVs replicate strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
Herein lies the secret to the asymptomatic carrier and the cause of severe cases of human infection.
Symptoms are severe mainly due to the over-activation of the immune response as well as the cytokine storm, with the lung damage becoming more severe as the immune response becomes stronger.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been released from CoV replication.
The same strategy for decoupling the correlation of immune responses may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
For this reason, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the management of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat-beta-CoVs that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been discovered, there are also bat-CoVs that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the wasps and other animals in the market were found to carry a virus identical to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
A beta-CoV of the troglobal has been found that is highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the troglobal may serve as one of the intermediate hosts or that the troglobal beta-CoV may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still in question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans either intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoVs in human transmission.
There is considerable evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and ferrets in wet markets, it is likely that the closure of the wet markets and the killing of all the ferrets in them effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be moved from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several pangolins beta-CoV lineages that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans via pangolins and other mammals remains to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arabian camel for a long time.
The camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
The Arabian camel is widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we cannot kill all the camels to control MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can eliminate the virus, a new genotype can emerge and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs that are potentially zoonotic are highly diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or more deadly to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China had to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in their natural reservoir until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that favor the spread of viruses, the chances of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to maintain a distance from the ecological niche of the natural reservoir of zoonotic viruses.
Some of the pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if bats transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to the pangolins, the conditions under which bats and pangolins share an ecological niche are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans contact bats should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an actual intermediate host, the way that mammal interacts with other species, which includes humans, bats, and pangolins, needs to be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infection and surveillance should be performed.
Whether bats, pangolins, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent virus may be identified in its natural host in the near future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating of the diagnostic criteria suspected case and confirmed case of COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
However, as 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases based on the Diagnostic and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
The guide has attracted much attention since its publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and management strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the commission has issued a total of seven editions with some of the contexts changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide as well as being a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also required updates based on the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Manual for COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires the combination of one of the epidemiological history descriptions with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or requires the fulfillment of three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other community where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other community where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before onset of symptoms; (4) history with cluster of confirmed cases (≥2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in a small area, such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte counts at the initial stage of the disease.
Diagnosing a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequencing of the entire virus genome showing high homogeneity for the newly known coronavirus; (3) a positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum; or a change of specific IgG test antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or a ≥4-fold increase in the titer at the recovery phase above the rate in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection on blood samples was added in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the ongoing research of researchers to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood sampling, which improves the availability of a variety of specimens, and supports the inclusion of certain positive antibody results into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence that warns us to be vigilant in patients with asymptomatic and asymptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classified people without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system also needs to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.
In closing, we hope for more direct evidence to emerge and ask readers for comment.
For diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases, we recommend following and adhering to the latest guidelines in the respective countries.
Our team will also update our guidelines periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of recorded infections included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases staying at home.
There were 17 deaths.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases are between 51 and 60 years old, and one case is between 41 and 50 years old.
It also says two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader said public transport would be stopped longer than originally planned, until Saturday.
The public transportation shutdown has been in place since March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic necessities -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on 8 March, in two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three were cured.
SARS-CoV-2 infections exceed the one million mark worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours since 10 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States (US), there are over 244 thousand cases of coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there are over 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the quarantine of the region until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens will remain on paid, work-free leave until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all day; previously, they only occurred between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia are lowering their toilet paper purchase limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, the Australian retail chains Woolworth's and Coles respectively lowered the toilet paper purchase limit to two and one packs per transaction in all stores nationwide.
ALDI also imposes a one-pack limit on Mondays.
The restriction was announced as a message on the cashier's and on the network's Facebook page.
Shoppers reportedly stockpiling supplies due to COVID-19 fears that the community would have to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
This change follows the four pack per transaction restriction previously applied by Woolworths and Coles respectively on 4 and 5 March.
In its media statement on March 8, Coles reported that with the imposition of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still out within an hour of delivery", and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales "spiked" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's in Canberra, too, they limited the number of permits to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Retailers Association of Australia, said that retailers tried to increase supplies, but local government agencies' restrictions on truck delivery times kept them in check.
It anticipates rising production costs, as suppliers struggle to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to having released the setup early, some stores were unable to hold Wednesday specials.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill up their inventory every night.
It emphasizes that toilet paper is a high-volume item so that the supply is low and, if sold out, leaves a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the shortage is felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there are lots of items on the shelves, if products like toilet paper and cyanide can be [purchased] and are in large quantities, the panic may be minimized, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, stressed they are working 24/7 to keep supplies on hand, according to News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder in Melbourne's auctions, as fewer auctions are held as buyers take the long Labor Day weekend break.
The Thursday edition of the NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were actually reluctant to implement the restrictions, according to ABC Australia's report on 3 March, saying that they did not plan to implement the purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitation, dry foods, hand washing soaps, and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday afternoons the British online supermarket Ocado was observed restricting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak - a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how widespread the disease has become, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If a country detects, tests, treats, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
We are very concerned both because of the alarming rate of spread and severity and because of the alarmingly slow rate of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
It said, in a note published by CNN in February, "except for influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever been traced from its emergence to sustained global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus".
It continues, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be managed simultaneously".
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "In essence, this outbreak is going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a World Public Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, around 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in around 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory failure syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptom resolution is generally around five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive actions include hand washing, closing the mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, and monitoring and self-isolation for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, night curfews, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused severe socioeconomic disruption globally, postponement or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, sporting activities, and widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with East and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance, and people originating from areas with significant virus cases.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is suspected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is related to bat coronaviruses, dengue coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to have become ill on 1 December 2019, and the person has no apparent association with the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial clusters of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post speculated that a case traceable to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province, was likely the first.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, a relatively small number of cases were reported among young people, with those aged 19 years and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies to not test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections went undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than the number of reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number was likely 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are cured.
For those who did not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, around 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing health conditions, which include cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, considering that the official figure probably does not include people who died without being tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of overdose deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A female spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual numbers", a statement reinforced by non-scientific reports of undercounting in the U.S. Overcounting often occurs in a pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy, respectively.
As of 13 March, over forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death to case ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617.204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the estimated case-to-case mortality ratio decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptoms after 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimated the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimated range is consistent with the results from the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis that analyzed the impact of the adjustment on the CFR estimate.
The WHO has asserted that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end duration of the outbreak are unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states, "Without control, outbreaks usually flatten and then begin to decline as the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at this time as to when it will occur".
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the epidemic could end in June" if the entire country could be mobilized to follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for up to a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraints and other measures will be needed "until the vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, because it is so easily transmitted, can disappear completely" and that the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
The virulence of the repeats will depend on the herd immunity and the mutation rate.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific and an infected person can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and a dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory sputum (phlegma), loss of smell, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and experience breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, chest tightness or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bruising of the face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear. Further progression of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with a confirmed test result, therefore, researchers recommend that those who are in close contact with a confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and screened for infection.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranging from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) is usually between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days.
The details of how the disease is spread are still being investigated.
COVID-19 is believed to be spread primarily by close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an uncovered cough can cause droplets to be pushed 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some researchers speculate that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that persist longer in the air and are produced when speaking.
Droplets can fall into the mouth or nose of someone who is nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (PCR), can cause respiratory secretions to be converted into aerosols and dispersed through the air.
Spread can also occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus may be spread through faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after symptom onset, although transmission may occur before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People test positive up to three days before onset of symptoms, which suggests transmission may occur before significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases have been laboratory confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact tracing research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and over four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease case cluster in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to coronaviruses in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed by exposure to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the early SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus was genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two bat-derived strains.
The virus has 96% similarity at the whole genome level with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between a dengue virus and a human virus.
To date, genome-wide comparisons have found at most 92% similarity in genetic material between the tenguil coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the tenguil is an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by the virus can be tentatively diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmation is eventually made via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in infected secretions or overlooked by CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many of the imaging features overlapping pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first released on 17 January.
Testing using real-time transcriptional reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used.
Testing can be done on a breath sample or blood sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on the nasopharynx, but the throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests have proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) in people who are symptomatic include opacity of the peripheral asymmetric ground glass and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because of overlap with other infections such as adenoviruses, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less specific for infections, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
An artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural network has been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and using a tissue when coughing or sneezing and discarding the tissue directly in the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical containment measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Governments in various regions have restricted or called for the suspension of all non-essential travel to and from affected countries and regions.
However, the virus has reached community-scale spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some community members do not know where or how they became infected. Healthcare providers who handle people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with statements from Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user's distance to another mobile phone.
Further, users will receive a message if they are in close proximity to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Miss-conceptions about how to prevent infection are spreading; for example, rinsing the nose and spitting with a mouthwash are ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after coming from the toilet or when their hands appear dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that destroys its protective coating.
Further, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content by volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people should not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute exposure of a disinfectant for stainless steel surfaces), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed COVID case in a public facility, such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the patient, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or use a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then discard the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and range of expiratory droplets that spread when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch the face with poorly clean hands, which is a major source of transmission".Masks are also recommended for use by people who are treating others who may have the disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people caring for COVID-19 patients, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks among members of the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of fabric.China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially when in close proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
The Thai health ministry encourages people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited their citizens from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam required all its citizens to wear face masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the zoo to wear a face mask.
Israel is asking all its citizens to wear face masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, mandates train and intercity bus passengers to wear face masks as of 1 April.
Panama mandates the use of face masks whenever outdoors, and recommends homemade face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restriction (also called physical restriction) is an infection control measure intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social distancing methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; as well as closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding public areas, using non-contact greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments are mandating or advocating social distancing in affected areas.
The maximum number of people recommended by US government agencies and health organizations to gather was quickly reduced, from 250 people (if no COVID-19 distribution is known in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings in public areas involving more than two people. The elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems who have a higher risk of serious illness and complications are advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas with community-level outbreaks. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social contact, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distancing" implies that people should completely isolate themselves socially and not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
These recommendations include the recommendation to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for true self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for people belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with a widespread spread of COVID-19 are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of their last possible exposure.
The strategy in epidemic control is containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
Containment is done in the early stages of an outbreak and is aimed at tracking and isolating infected people as well as taking other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of disease, the next step is to move to mitigation: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health care system and the community.
A combination of containment and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction rate to less than 1. Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is to try to bring down the peak of the epidemic, known as the tapering of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overburdening healthcare and provides more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to address the outbreak include individual prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing of face masks, and self-quarantine; community-level measures aimed at physical restraint, such as closing schools and cancellation of mass gatherings; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental-level measures, such as surface cleaning. Other drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China as the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries have also implemented measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass quarantine and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who self-quarantine and imposes heavy fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and punished hoarders of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States show that mitigation (slowing, but not stopping, the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Suppression can be selective, but must be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is first achieved), as otherwise transmission will rebound rapidly once suppression measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have social and economic impacts.
There are no approved specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, which includes testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medication, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the patient's condition.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental step in responding to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO regional offices in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to redirect resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, if possible cancelling elective procedures, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as increasing intensive care capacity by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These cases are mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these animal species; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.A cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the other, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superior for issuing warnings.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public announcement on 31 December and informed WHO.
Quite a lot of unknown pneumonia cases were not reported to the health authorities in Wuhan which then triggered an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and rail transit point.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data shows that 6,174 people had developed symptoms as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restrict free movement and make border controls.
The national response includes containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or quarantine zones) and night curfews.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in some form of quarantine zones in the United States, more than 50 million people were quarantined zones in the Philippines, about 59 million were quarantined zones in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were quarantined zones in India.

Initial genetic testing of the patient's samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public announcement was released by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When the notice was implemented, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the general secretary of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been called the "largest quarantine in human history", a cordon sanitaire or sanitary restriction was announced on 23 January to stop travel in and out of Wuhan, and was expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Lunar New Year celebrations (25 January) are cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.

For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international tourists entering the city.On 23 March, the only mainland Chinese case was transmitted domestically five days earlier, in this case via a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been essentially blocked and the outbreak had been contained in China.
Travel restrictions were eased on the same day in Hubei, in addition to from Wuhan, two months after the provincial quarantine was imposed.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would expire.
People who want to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On 30 March, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provided a monetary stimulus package for enterprises.The State Council declared a day of mourning by initiating a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10:00 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online by observing physical restrictions to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.[104]
On 20 January 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On 20 February, the national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to the gathering of a new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji followers who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, among 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or about 13% had reported symptoms.
On 28 February, over 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases are quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected and changed, with South Korea introducing what is considered the largest and best organized program in the world to screen the virus in the population, isolate each infected person, and track and quarantine people who came in contact with them.
Filtering methods include the obligation of self-reporting symptoms by newcomers from abroad via mobile apps, on-site or drive-thru virus testing with results available the next day, and increased testing capability to over 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire city.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for impeachment of President Moon over their claims that the government was wrong in handling the outbreak, or instead, praising the president's reaction.
On 23 March, South Korea was reported to have the lowest single-day total of cases in four weeks.

The Shia shrine in Qom remains open for pilgrims until 16 March 2020.After China, Iran became the centre of the spread of the virus during February.
Amid claims that the outbreak rate in Iran is being covered up, more than ten countries traced their cases back to Iran on 28 February, indicating that the outbreak rate may be worse than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government on that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly testing positive for the virus on 3 March.

It was stated that there is a greater risk for spread in closed institutions such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, which is the highest number in the country since the beginning of the outbreak.
As of March 17, at least 12 former or current Iranian politicians or government officials have died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran is facing 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes from coronavirus.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights calls for economic sanctions to be eased for countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
Later, a cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced new laws to contain the outbreak, which included quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.

A CNN report said that contributing to the high fatality rate was the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test everyone who had been infected with the virus.
Initially, the UK's response to the virus was one of the most lax among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any social restrictions or mass quarantines on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being perceived as unresponsive and less intense in responding to public concerns.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement calling for a halt to all non-essential travel and social contact and advising people to work from home, if possible, as well as avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational venues, such as pubs and fitness centres, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis.[citation needed] On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social restrictions, namely banning gatherings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities only to activities considered to be of the utmost importance.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions are enforced by the police through fines and disbandment of groups.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control, the US government's leading public health agency, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
However, the United States was slow to initiate testing to obscure the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was disrupted by defective test kits manufactured by the federal government in February, lack of federal government approval for non-governmental test kits (by academia, enterprises, and hospitals) until late February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for testing until early March (doctor's orders required afterwards).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reports that fewer than 4,000 tests have been conducted in the United States.

Belgium also recalled 100,000 disposable masks, which were alleged to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa.
WHO commends the Chinese government's efforts in managing and containing the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of covering up to hinder prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "providing routine updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in reaction to the central government's decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that while the measure was "clearly not a WHO recommendation", it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where the outbreak is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak a Certified World Public Health Emergency (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC measure since it was first introduced during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared due to the "risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have adequate health systems".
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that unnecessarily disrupt international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community to contribute $675 million to be used to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting countries that "do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus if an outbreak occurs".
Further, Tedros made the statement that "our limits of strength are at the weakest point of the chain" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more dearly later".In a press conference on February 11, the WHO designated COVID-19 as the name of the disease for this virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide a "response in the form of a deployment of the full strength of the UN system".
Then, the UN activated the Crisis Management Team to enable coordination of the entire UN response, which according to WHO would allow them to "focus on the health response, while other agencies could use their membership to bear the impact of the outbreak in the broader social, economic, and development fields".
On 14 February, a WHO-led China Joint Mission Team was activated; the team aimed to provide international and WHO staff in China in order to assist domestic management and to evaluate "the severity and spread of disease" by holding workshops and meetings with relevant national-level boards and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of counteraction activities at the provincial and district level, covering urban and rural settings". On 25 February, the WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic" and said that, although it is too early to call it a pandemic, countries should remain "in the preparedness phase".
In response to the growing epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to Iran to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, warned that, "It's time for every government on the planet to face the statement: Wake up.
The virus may be coming to your place and you should be prepared", and urged that proper countermeasures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan further stated that the current data does not allow public health offices to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration means "basically we accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to the virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming rates of spread and severity, as well as the alarming rate of inaction".The WHO received bitter criticism for being judged inadequate in its handling of the pandemic, which included delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
One of the strong reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April, which was addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to request his resignation.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the need to respect the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts states that everyone has the right to life-saving intervention and the government bears the responsibility for this.
The group stresses that a lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as a justification for discriminating against certain groups.
The experts underline that every individual has a right to health, including people with disabilities, minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, people living in extreme poverty, people in prison, refugees, and other groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are working to address the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a programme to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with perspectives and advice.
From policies to strengthen the world's health and economic systems to overcome the impact of regional quarantines and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes the National Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response in the face of the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government received criticism from the United States, the British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, over the handling of the pandemic that began in Hubei province, China.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were suspended in connection with the handling of quarantine measures in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions to the outbreak in the region.
Some commentators believe that the move is meant to shield Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected previous claims of a coronavirus outbreak starting in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has called the coronavirus the "China virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's covert actions have given strength to a virus that is now turning into a global pandemic". This was eventually criticized by a number of critics as racist and "distracting from its administration's failure to address the coronavirus".
The Daily Beast obtained a US government message outlining the communications strategy and apparently originated from the National Security Council, with the strategy being quoted as "All about China.
We were told to try and get this message out in any way we could, including press conferences and appearances on television". Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda drive to influence the world.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is a "geo-political component, which includes a battle for influence through the reversal of facts and 'politics of benevolence'".
Borrell also said that, "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, they are a responsible and reliable partner".
China also called for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid intended for other countries to their own countries.
There are also reported mask-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of ventilators intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity towards the coronavirus-stricken Italy.
Maurizio Massari, the Italian ambassador to the EU, said that "Only China is responding bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity".
On 22 March, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin mobilized the Russian army to send military medical personnel, specialized disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" who said that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm attack.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to US counterparts, [Putin] assumed that if US manufacturers of medical equipment and materials get the chance, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary".
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, the exercise puts not only the lives of the US troops and many European countries participating in it at risk, but also the people of the countries in which they operate". The Iranian government has been hit particularly hard by the virus, with around two dozen members of parliament infected along with fifteen current or former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and saying that his country was struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States' sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts suspect that this could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election.[citation needed] Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized "Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that every person arriving from South Korea would be placed in two-week quarantine at a government-designated location.
Initially, South Korean public opinion was divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed the petition, either calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims of government misconduct in dealing with the outbreak, or praising his response.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspending parliament and general elections, and punishing people deemed to be spreading false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak is blamed on cases of supply shortages, stemming from the increased global use of equipment to combat the outbreak, panic buying, and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The United States Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Some districts also suffered panic buying that resulted in a shortage of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, which triggered supply shortages.
In particular, the tech industry has been warning about the delay in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand caused a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and WHO warns that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity resulted in formula milk shortages in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared from food shortages.
Chinese and Italian measures against the illegal stockpiling and trafficking of essential products were successful and the anticipated acute food shortages in Europe and North America were averted.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not yet experienced a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves are only found temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials are moving away from pork reserves to ensure the nutritional sufficiency of the population.
Similar legislation exists in Italy, which obliges food producers to keep a reserve for such emergencies.
The global economic slowdown has been felt in China: according to media reports on 16 March, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales plummeted by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak is considered to pose a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential of the end result.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the impact of the economic collapse caused by the epidemic on global growth could exceed the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by experts at Washington University in St. Louis says the outbreak has impacted more than $300 billion on the world's supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reportedly "in disarray" after the price of crude oil suffered a sharp drop due to a decline in demand from China.
On 24 February, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, which include the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
The three stock indexes closed the week with declines of over 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government's credit rating, but maintained a Negative Outlook.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
A lot of people think a recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the central bank and the state.
The central banks reacted much more quickly than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and government actions restricting travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional carrier Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry is at a level never seen before.
Some railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Lunar New Year holiday.
A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by the central and regional governments, including the annual Lunar New Year festival, and private companies also independently closed shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and territories, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and cancelled New Year celebrations. The retail sector was hit globally with reduced hours of work or temporary closures.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers are down 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in foot traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world implemented additional measures, such as sanitation upgrades, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and event cancellations.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are displaced in the interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province.As of March 2020, more than 10 million Americans have lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus pandemic could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit schemes.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by the French and the British.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were hit hard by the pandemic, which impacted the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and self-employed.
Arts and cultural sector organisations strive to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, safeguard the safety of employees and the community, and support artists where possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being deployed to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another adverse impact of this new and rapidly growing disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which falls in the last week of the Christian conversion season of Lent, were cancelled.
Many dioceses encourage elderly Christians to stay home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, online live broadcasts or television, while others offer drive-in or line-in worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the evacuation of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and mosques were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world's sporting calendar since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the planning of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "re-scheduled until after 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021".[24] Around the world, casinos and other gaming venues were closed and live poker tournament broadcasts were delayed or cancelled.
This has led to many gamblers moving to online gambling, many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands postponing or cancelling concert tours.
Many of the major theaters, including Broadway, have also postponed their performances.
Artists are exploring ways to continue to produce and share works through the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live concerts online or creating a web-based "festival" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicize their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are circulating online with many people turning to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a rise in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as towards people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) noted the racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that the Chinese deserve to receive the virus or receive what they claim as a corresponding reward.
Several African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There's been support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in the affected areas.
Following the spread of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be targets of suspicion and xenophobia.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increased rates of racial harassment and assaults.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus "Chinese Virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuated Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China, and studying in major Indian cities were reportedly subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, stated that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "that is why God is taking revenge on them".
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misguided". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents is rampant due to the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers that use paid blocking have removed it for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to the epidemic available in open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results quickly on a preprint server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA only.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have been infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who are asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality figure for the disease and the immunity rate of the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on the throat are only reliable in the first week of illness.
The virus then disappears in the throat while it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for infected people tested on the second week, sample material can be taken from the inner airway using a suction catheter or material excreted through cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed testing on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinically-grade PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) detector on 28 January 2020.
The tool detects the "E" gene that is shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first enterprises to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the New Coronavirus 2019 Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests on the older version of the test kit gave inconclusive results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed successfully throughout February 2020.
Testing using the two components was considered unreliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that were state and local laboratories allowed to conduct testing.
The test was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits were announced; collection and processing of specimens should be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care.[101] On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.[102] On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours with a high volume so that one machine can perform around 4,128 tests in 24 hours.[103]
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for testing which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Since it does not require a series of temperature change cycles, this method can give a positive result in only five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently around 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day.Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the nucleocapsid (N protein) protein of a new coronavirus are being developed in Taiwan, with the hope of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes like rapid influenza tests.
A literature review published in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic photography has little diagnostic value at an early stage, as CT [computed tomography] findings may already be present before symptom onset".
Specific features on CT include a bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with a peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation form as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the origin of the current pandemic showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many of the imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals as early as 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these checks, but their availability will depend on the production level for each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although a series of specimens may be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a peripheral blood sample obtained through a skin prick is generally used.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction step is not required before examination.As of 26 March 2020, the FDA mentions 29 agencies that provide notices to the agency as required and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA based on emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kit that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
Its capacity to test up to several hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR testing of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong devised a scheme so that suspected patients could stay at home, "the emergency department would give the patient a specimen tube", they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results a few moments later. The UK NHS announced that the NHS was pioneering a home-based suspected case testing scheme so as to eliminate the risk of the patient infecting others if they come to the hospital or having to disinfect the ambulance if used. In the testing of a suspected COVID-19 case, a health professional would use the appropriate precautionary sample.
The long-term testing center has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and most extensive testing of any country.On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany has a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings and 10,700 tests were performed in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, the test of the latitude is offered in some major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests performed in Germany is unknown as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including week 12 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing further if the combined samples were found positive.In Wuhan, a 2,000-square-meter emergency detection laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: 火眼, or "Eye of Fire" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling shows that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and the associated costs for handling the quarantine could be doubled if this testing capacity were not available.
The Wuhan laboratory was soon followed by the Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The open-source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 examinations. This balanced design can be run in a small laboratory without the need for robotic fluid handling.
Until March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents were a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Due to this, a number of researchers are exploring sample preparation protocols involving heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing.On 31 March, the UAE reportedly conducted more coronavirus testing per capita population than any other country, and is poised to scale up testing to reach a large part of the population.
This was achieved through a combination of longitudinal testing and the purchase of mass-scale population-based laboratory results from Grup 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first lab of its scale outside of China.
Various test recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German recipe for the production of test kits that were sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop them themselves.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, thus slowing the testing available in the U.S. At the start of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits; these two countries and Australia were unable to provide enough test kits to meet the demand and testing recommendations of health experts.
On the other hand, experts say that the availability of extensive testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built up in a few years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests pending in private US laboratories, and the supply of both the test kit and the chemical reagents has become critical.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues with their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government later removed the bureaucratic obstacles that prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to a failure to collect the sample or use the test equipment correctly.
The Spanish ministry said that they would withdraw the equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kit purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test kits be dumped into the Danube river. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and they were not "used".The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that the test kits could not be used.
The testing, followed by quarantine of people who tested positive and tracing of people who had contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive final result.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, about 10 days apart.
About half of the people who test positive have no symptoms, and all cases found are quarantined.
With the travel restrictions in place, new infections are being eliminated completely.
With aggressive contact tracing, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantines, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore developed much more slowly than other developed countries despite the absence of extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the holiday on 23 March.
Some other countries also responded to the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive territorial quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had significantly lower fatality rates, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the "% positive test result" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only people who are in the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive results than a country that tests all of its population, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Consistent hand washing with soap at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also catch respiratory illnesses, such as influenza or colds, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical times of the day that are very important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after wiping your child's butt or changing diapers, before bathing your child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing a diaper or cleaning a child who has just used the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygienic practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronaviruses, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce the number of babies dying at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increasing hand washing practices could slightly increase toddler height.
In developing countries, child mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action could reduce the mortality rate from the disease by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ISPA), as an unconscious behavior practiced in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, which is the major ISPA, is the number one cause of infant death; the disease causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a firmly established habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, as well as reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying out of the skin.
A 2012 study conducted in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which are especially prevalent among healthcare workers.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of disease by fecal-oral route, namely: before and after using the toilet (toilet, toilet), after cleaning the child's buttocks (changing diapers), before wiping the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when it is important to practice proper hand-washing techniques to prevent the spread of disease are before and after treating a wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching litter.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is still low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practice handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate with 23 percent. Several behavior change methodologies are now available to promote the adoption of handwashing behaviors with soap at critical moments. Group handwashing for students at prescribed times is one of the options in developing countries to introduce handwashing in child behavior.
The Primary Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the right-scale action to support children's health and education.
The twice-a-year administration of anti-worm medication, coupled with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of the teeth with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Cleansing of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main job of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic waste, are not readily soluble in water.
However, the cleansing of fats and proteins is aided by adequate water flow.
Solid soaps, due to their reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired from previous use.
A small number of studies examining bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soaps concluded that transfer was not possible because the bacteria were washed away with the foam.
However, the CDC still states "liquid soap with a handless release is preferred".
Antibacterial soaps are widely promoted to the health-conscious public.
To date, there has been no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants is better for naturally antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (crocodile saliva, vitamins, menthols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that plain soap is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing triclose in preventing disease and cleansing hand bacteria.
Warm water that's comfortable for hand washing isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oils that keep dirt and bacteria out.
However, contrary to what many people believe, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hand.
Hand sanitizers or hand antiseptics are non-water-based hygiene agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic water-based hand sanitizers (also called alcohol-based hand scrubs, antiseptic hand scrubs, or hand sanitizers) came into prominence.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel or together with a humektan such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide vinegar enhances further antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol are an efficient germicidal.
Alcohol cyanidation of rubbing kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcoholic tonic containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3.5 reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5 reduction) of bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of both hands as well as the sides and tips of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing them on both palms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of rubbing, especially when the hands appear dirty.
The increased use of sanitizing agents due to the ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms; however, sanitizing agents should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can lead to dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps and detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol-based hand scrubs are rare.
Lower propensity to cause irritating contact dermatitis is an attraction of this product compared to hand washing with water and soap.
Although effective, the non-aqueous agents do not cleanse the hands of organic matter, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogens are still present on the hands.
The success of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on their ingredients and formulation, and historically, these products have performed significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after administration, unlike alcohol, whose potency has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to a progressive reaction of side effects.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, if it comes into contact with water, the ash forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as alternatives to soap when soap is not available.
Proper handwashing techniques based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's recommendations for preventing the transmission of disease include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because the dammed basin may be contaminated, whereas the water temperature seems to be unaffected.
Wipe your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Bilas carefully underwater flow.
Pissing in a basin can make the contaminated hands come back.
Dry with a dry cloth or let it air dry.
Wet, damp hands are more susceptible to re-contamination, and the areas most frequently missed are the thumbs, wrists, the area between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeling nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturising lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, pouring water from a suspended and canned strainer or bottle and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural districts in developing countries), there are water-efficient solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
The tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a water bottle suspended by a rope, a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hands, and a handful of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the tissue paper industry European Tissue Symposium, to compare the cleanliness levels of paper towels, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% in the fingertips and 254% in the palms.
Drying with a jet air dryer causes an increase in total bacterial count of an average of 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms of the hands.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the fingertips and 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential for cross-contamination of other toilet users and the toilet environment due to each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which vents the air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of warm air hand dryers spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show significant microorganism spread.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
After drying the hands, the following changes in bacterial population were observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel if soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand-washing was made mandatory long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of the device.
Medical handwashing is performed for a minimum of 15 seconds, using copious amounts of soap and water or gel to lubricate and rub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed together with interlocked fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, a hairbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in water on the hands, the hands should be thoroughly washed and dried with a clean cloth.
After drying, a paper cloth is used to turn off the water tap (and open the exit doors if necessary).
This avoids recontamination of the hands from the surface.
The purpose of hand washing in health care settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the lack of hand washing is still at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses continually forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infection rates by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a spreadsheet that shows the standards for hand washing and hand scrubbing in the healthcare sector.
The WHO hand hygiene concept guidelines are also available on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has a "Five Minutes" to wash your hands:
after exposure to blood/ bodily fluids
prior to aseptic duty, and
After treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (known as "medicinal" or "antimicrobial" soap) works to kill the handwash.
Such killing function may be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic resistant organisms are very prevalent.To 'rub' the hands before surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile cloth to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub as well as other sterile instruments to clean the nail beds are required.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of the hands and forearms to the elbow, usually 26 minutes.
The long scrubbing time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, the water in the forearm should be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After hand washing, hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical cloak is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash or use hand sanitizer before and after handling sick people.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of handwashing came from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefit was very small when handwashing frequency was increased above 35%.
Washing with plain soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison between rubbing hands with an alcohol-based solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each shows that alcohol-based hand scrubs reduce bacterial contamination 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include education for staff on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine the most effective interventions across different health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and fundamental way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable water, soap, or handwashing facility in people's homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing taps near private or public toilets are rarely available, although options for cheap handwashing facilities are available.
However, low hand-washing rates can also be due to ingrained habits and not due to lack of soap or water.
The promotion and encouragement of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and produce long-term behavioral changes in populations.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of the promotion of handwashing in schools is the "Three-Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is met, the school can move from one star to eventually three stars.
Building a handwashing facility can be part of the handwashing campaign that is being done to reduce childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to achieve the goal of behavior change.
Several studies have examined the cost effectiveness of hand washing overall in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the measure of years lost to illness.
One study found that promoting handwashing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as new mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At that time, many people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against the infectious disease.
For example, posters of "proper hand washing techniques" are hung next to the hand washing sinks in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands off" means expressing one's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to be involved in something.
The phrase originates from the biblical chapter in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used phrase in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands continuously to clean imaginary stains; an act that shows her guilt for the evil she has done and for having persuaded her husband to do it.
It has also been found that, after remembering or contemplating an unethical act, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to value hand washing equipment more highly.
Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after the massage are less likely to engage in compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religion mandates hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but no soap to wash hands, is a part of ritual hand washing in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
Additionally, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam all require hand-washing before and after eating.
Workplace risk management for COVID-19 is
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodologies to hazard control for the prevention of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control in the workplace depends on the workplace and job duties, which are based on risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the individual risk factors of the worker who may be susceptible to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure occupations have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers; for these occupations, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging employees to stay in the hospital if hospitalized, respiratory etiquette, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at risk of exposure includes work that requires close or frequent contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have been infected due to an ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This group includes employees who have contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and high volume retail orders.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and providing protective gear when encountering COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgues exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at high exposure risk, which increases to a very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for these workers includes the control of techniques, such as negative pressure ventilation chambers, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact on the workplace.
Employees may not come to work because they are sick, need to care for others, or are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and the way these goods are obtained (such as shopping outside of peak hours, through shipping, or in a queue).
Finally, shipments from geographical regions that are highly affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. Precautions and infectious disease response plans can be used to guide protective action.
The plan considers the level of risk associated with various workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from household and community arrangements, as well as individual employee risk factors, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls needed to overcome those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Precautions and plans for the control of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of containment include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the response measures taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls based on their effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical handling covers isolating employees from job-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in a work policy or procedure that requires the action of an employee or an employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent partial exposure.
All types of APDs should be selected based on the hazards to the worker, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirator), consistently and correctly applied, inspected, maintained, and replaced regularly, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a low-exposure risk occupation has minimal work contact with the public and other co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, respiratory ethics include covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissues and trash containers, preparing for remote work or work shifts with a gradual arrival/return time, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and performing routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing medication or other symptom-modifying medication, and that sick leave policies be flexible to allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk exposure work includes work that requires close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around the business location, or because a person recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and high-volume retail orders. Technical controls for this and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards, and installing drive-through windows or lanterns for customer service. Administrative controls to support these and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, making work shifts with gradual arrival/departure, stopping non-essential travel to locations where COVID-19 is being experienced, developing emergency communication plans including forums to respond to worker concerns, equipping workers with the latest education and training on COVID-19 protective behavior factors, training employees on how to use protective clothing and equipment and how to use hazardous materials, providing a work environment and personal hygiene resources that regularly remove dust and dust, limiting access to public and customer service, and employee safety, and employee wear of protective gear, or at least hand-holding, wearing of gogglass or other protective measures at work, or being handcuffinduced, or wearing of hand-protective gear.
Workers in these high-risk groups rarely need a respirator.
If someone falls ill on an aircraft, the proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by 6 feet, assigning a cabin crew to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly other personal protective equipment if a sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a life-saving bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial cruises, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard control includes delaying travel if ill, isolating oneself, and informing the on-board medical center immediately if a person experiences a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the quarantined person's cabin.In addition to community outbreaks, for schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean up or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in a school building.
If there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be applied, which include: cancelling field trips, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or dining in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is high transmission in local communities, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school closures may be considered.For law enforcement officers who are performing routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must have contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 people are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during capture, workers should clean and disinfect belts and duty gear before reuse using a household spray or cleaning cloth and follow standard operating procedures for handling and disposing of used APDs as well as for handling and washing dirty clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care workers and morgues to be in the high or very high exposure risk category.
Jobs at high exposure risk include the provision of healthcare, support, laboratory, and medical transportation personnel exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This occupation becomes at risk of exposure especially if the worker performs aerosol-producing procedures on, or collects or handles specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimen retrieval.
High-risk morgue jobs cover workers involved in preparing the remains of people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these jobs become at very high exposure risk if the worker performs an autopsy. Additional technical handling for these risk groups includes isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol-producing procedures are performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
The specimen should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of a known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected patient, and people performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or better filtered N95 face mask respirators should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes suitability testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve comfort for workers. WHO does not recommend full or coverall covers because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening personnel at the point of entry.
For people taking respiratory specimens, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective eyewear, or face shields, gowns, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that APD supplies are insufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APDs through remote medical care, physical barriers such as transparent windows, with only people involved in direct care being allowed to enter the containment chambers of COVID-19 patients, using only the APDs required for a particular task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that makes clear the global human connectedness and the responsibilities that we have to each other.
We've never had to face the challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and global community development that is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we've witnessed among all of our co-workers through emails, calls, and conversations is a tremendous validation of the extraordinary people that we're fortunate enough to work with.
It is my gratitude and pride that I can call you all my co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for the world today to have access to Wikipedia and how it's a powerful symbol for this important resource to stay online for everyone.
Your job is to make this happen, whether you're keeping this site up, helping pay our colleagues, or helping keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, especially now.
This is a moment when not just what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the teams met yesterday to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and how best to keep the organization afloat during this time.
We're all very keen to relieve the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more hours than normal, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable these days, and whether you need to care for a loved one, make a purchase, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your work hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have to be said, but we said it.
No sick leave or PTO is required, just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that the key areas of work are completed.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please inform Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the proper attention from management).
The associates who are paid by the hour will be paid in full.
We've said it, and we'll say it again, to honor our commitment to our contractor partners and hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal working hours when things are normal.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we're behind you.
Many people use their jobs as a way to relieve stress in the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to be done.
SRE, HRM Operations, Trust & Safety, as well as Fundraising teams, among others, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We're going to begin a process with all departments to assess the current goals and shift our focus to supporting the essentials of our mission.
There's so much to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't do anything for the future.
We're not planning on "working overtime" after the pandemic passes.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet the current unrealistic deadlines.
We are aware that the situation is changing and will be willing to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
In order to adapt to the new statements and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intent is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work with fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the current workload and planning stress throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and team on the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you APP team for your leadership on this.
Status, exposure, and office cleanup
Last week, we were informed that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But, because of our great concern, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in our San Francisco office.
They're using hospital-grade antiseptic fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and every elevator that accesses our floor.
The building implements its own safety assurance protocols using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We're happy that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full remote work order, in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we're also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time colleagues working remotely realize that this may need adjusting and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of the closure to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider dividing it into several days.
Clearly define the meeting, set the agenda, and send the reading material ahead of time.
Make videos the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and instant connections.
Designate a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and record the list of speakers, and someone to help make meeting notes (or do collaborative note-taking).
Email tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about shared jobs
The SDM Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support the enhancement of distributed work across the Foundation.
In recent weeks we have asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as the Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete the approved grant activity and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify the target.
Next week we'll follow up with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiment from the entire global community seems to be one of sadness over the disruption, but also of relief over the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll be sending out an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend time connecting with each other.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential COVID-19 related information on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep this page updated and ensure that all information is in one place.
We are also trying to maintain routine communications with staff who live in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key workflows, or difficulties with coverage, or anything else that may require assistance, please feel free to let us know and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations for HR International.
None of these changes should be seen as a dereliction of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, this shift is an acknowledgement that, in the present, our jobs and responsibilities may need to be adapted in ways that we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support for our movement, and provide the world with the services they rely on.
The work we planned in advance will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for the important work that's coming in the next few weeks and maybe months.
We need all of you to make this happen, and for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can do your best work when it's needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The team is composed of four members: Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity opposite to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cell membranes.
The ACE2 protein has an M2 peptide N-terminal domain and a C-terminal renal collectrin amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with enzymatically active domains exposed on the cell surfaces of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes mainly of type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE is the hormone that breaks down angiotensin I into the angiotensin II vasoconstrictive.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilating angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein on the spike or spike of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into the endosomes located within the cell.
This process of viral entry also requires priming of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE and ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on 11 July 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% reduction in risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the result was less robust compared to the risk of pneumonia overall".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with an average of 30 minutes of action plus a duration of effect of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with increased blood circulation of angiotensin II. Infusion of rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to assist contact tracing in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government backing in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for developing contact tracing applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially in relation to systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Alternatives that are less intrusive to privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support the Bluetooth-based app directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 patients.
It's used in over 200 cities in China.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure of potentially infected people and provide a rapid response to health care authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still pending approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing app is in advanced development and will be available for distribution in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has cited a number of practical problems that can occur with application-based systems, including false positives and possible ineffectiveness if the data the application captures is limited to a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting it to only "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon are enforcing similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be discontinued once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued statements calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
The organization stated eight conditions on the government project:
surveillance must be "lawful, necessary, and proportionate";
the monitoring and surveillance requirements shall have a sunset clause;
the use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid the increasing discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
There should be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
participation means all "relevant stakeholders" are needed, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporters ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issue checklists.
The Google/Apple plan proposed is intended to address the problem of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than apps, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential for significant privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with a central server need to access private location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system is used to track contacts.
Instead of using dedicated apps, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text message to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made the location information publicly available, which was allowed by a sweeping change in information privacy laws after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-protecting contact tracing is an established concept, with a large body of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort containing both centralized and decentralized approaches, and not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes the Decentralized Privacy-Protecting Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called Contact Incident Number, CEN), the Protocol and the Privacy-Sensitive Mechanism for Cellular Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or intersectional data streams to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research from the whitepaper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar initiative is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies and was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and operators without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have essentially the same approach and are many overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and alerting applications, which is a key aspect to achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications open source.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that operate the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
launching tools to enable governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the issue of data capture and continuous surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, then removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
Drug repositioning (also called new purpose, new profile, or new task assignment on a drug or therapy transition) is the use of an approved drug for a new treatment purpose, i.e. for a disease or medical condition that is different from the initial purpose of drug development.
This is the line of scientific research currently underway to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has around 66 proteins that can be drug targets, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these ligand binding sites could serve as the basis for a project to develop antiviral drugs effective against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A, et al investigated several candidate compounds which were then optimized and their similarity to approved drugs with the highest similarity was analyzed to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential drugs in their preclinical studies to be recommended in the design of clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydrochlorokuine are two of four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydrochlorquine in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The drug has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized on the basis of the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but could not receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC states that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
The doctor said they used the drug when "there was no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and efficacy trial of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved to be "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, whereas the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency warned the public that the evidence to support the drug is limited and premature.
On 2 April, Germany announced it would purchase the drug from Japan for preparation and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration to purchase the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of disease with the virus having multiplied.
This medicine may not be safe for use by pregnant women or people trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to proteases.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find compounds that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific community over the diversion of resources to repurpose drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several phyllo-, pneumo-, paramixso-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the emergence of resistance through mutation that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early trials suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by the University Hospitals of Cleveland, one for people with moderate illness and one for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and severely ill COVID-19 patients, namely two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began a trial for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with a newly diagnosed asymptomatic coronavirus infection.
For a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and complications of the lungs in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6000 adults aged 40 years and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or who do not use effective contraception are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study in 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium at both prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has been focused on targeting new treatments to antiviral drugs approved and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition Chinese guidelines
Some of the antibiotics identified as potential drugs that could be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by the Chinese.
In addition, trials are also being conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many efforts underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the disease, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread across the world in 2020, resulting in a huge investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative issued a statement in April that the things to consider in developing a vaccine are speed, production capacity, deployment at the scale needed, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The primary platform targets that progressed to Phase I security studies, include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (developer of Phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little publicly available information (believed to be in planning or being planned).
Phase I-II trials perform preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, usually performed randomly, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, while determining a more accurate effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring for side effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates in development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 of them have not yet been in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential for a molecular trapping vaccine that would genetically modify a viral protein to stimulate an immune response.
On 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they have started developing a vaccine, with a target of human testing in 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is working with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with similar technology to that used for neoantigen cancer vaccination therapy.
On 25 March, the head of the research agency announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they had started a vaccine project to make a peptide Ii-Key vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Supply Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
Further, the partnership announced plans for preclinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, vaccine development would take at least around one and a half to two years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier in the week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccines", which was protested by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, an mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they would have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and a final-stage vaccine candidate could begin human trials in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Coalition for Epidemic Prevention Innovation (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium that includes Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with the total investment of CEPI in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine reaching US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed in 14 days after receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 COVID-19 medical response research projects, which includes a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million in funding specifically for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" containing some new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, in mice; they stated that "MNA administering the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine induced a potentiated antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that became visible 2 weeks after immunization".
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is engineered to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities pooled resources to access the supercomputer from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Further trials in Australia are looking at 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine being developed will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, suggests the need for containment measures to achieve biosafety level 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no proven safe and effective vaccine or drug for SARS in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
As MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted conspiracy theories claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known before and that a vaccine was available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally around five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly transmitted between humans through close contact, often through small splashes or droplets produced through coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although produced during inhalation, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to a surface and are not contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can survive for up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms appear and after the later stages of the disease.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and those who are caring for them.
Recommendations on the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend against wearing masks, some recommend wearing them, and some require them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, shortness of breath, or sore throat can be found, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, were observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only clinical signs of chest congestion and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who are symptomatic will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is not known and is being investigated, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a viral load on a large scale.
Speaking out loud releases more splashes or droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can push the droplet up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the United States National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol transmission is possible and air collectors placed in an aisle outside the chamber of people produce a positive sample for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (PCR), can cause respiratory secretions to be converted into aerosols and then dispersed through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although transmission may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully understood how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
Specifically, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used correctly; soap products break down the protective fatty coating of the virus, deactivating the virus, and freeing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in naturally occurring related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which destroys its protective bubble.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illness.
The high level of cardiovascular symptoms is due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very highly in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in COVID-19 infected patients in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for airway epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, the T cells secreting the pathogenic GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with the recruitment of monocytes secreting inflammatory IL-6 and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported in autopsies.
WHO has published several testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time transcriptional reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on breath samples obtained through nasopharyngeal aspiration; however, nasal or sputum swab samples may also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but require two blood samples taken two weeks apart so that the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing independently to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and if a person has been infected previously) are under development, but not widely used.
Chinese experience with such tests shows an accuracy of only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital recommend methods for detecting infection based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Ground-glass multilobar bilateral opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution are commonly seen early in infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (thickening of the lobular septum with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on the autopsy were:
Macroscopic: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the lungs, and pulmonary edema
Four severities of viral pneumonia are observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of many-nucleated giant cells
severe: diffuse alveolar pneumonia (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Incurable pneumonia: exudate formation in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation disseminated (DIC); leukocyte rroblast reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying home, avoiding public places, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends the use of the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places, partly to limit transmission by asymptomatic people.
The restriction guidelines also cover people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
No drug is known to be effective in preventing COVID-19.Since a vaccine is not expected until early 2021, a major part of dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coming from the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Further the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are unavailable.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active agent for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Hygiene and lifestyle as well as a healthy diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care physicians and pulmonary specialists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in an AIIR in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and air precautions.The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: APD cloak, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, a respirator (rather than a face mask) is preferable.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorized these masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are mild enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are severe.
Respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively being investigated for hospitalized people, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high nasal flow cannula or bi-positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods produces the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some physicians prefer to remain on invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of health systems to handle a sudden surge in COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered the intensive care unit, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients end up in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation is becoming more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more severe.
A ventilator capable of high pressure control mode and PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some drugs undergoing testing have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviruses can be tested on people with severe illnesses.
The volunteers who are recommended to participate in the trial of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted provisional authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases of a person's life being very or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical studies needed to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to address the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is capable of detecting 'close contacts' using surveillance data so as to detect potential risks of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also informs local health officials.Research analytics on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who came into contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the cell phone data of people suspected of being infected with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the phone location data aggregate with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
The Russians are using facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he had been told by mobile operators that "40% of the population is still on the move".
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Furthermore, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People can experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or the fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health emergencies, stress, and economic decline are perfect storms that are putting people's mental health and well-being at risk".
The disease can be mild with few or no symptoms, which resembles other common upper respiratory illnesses, such as colds.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are still scarce.In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs causing pneumonia.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, specifically increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while renal function disorders were seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 profile showed increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in the hospital.
However, patients who were transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between admission and death.
In a study looking at early cases, the median time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoid exudate in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes are observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image resembles that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people have a congenital condition. The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of a light case count could lead to a higher death toll.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases could mean that current mortality rates are counted too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.There is concern about the long-term sequelae of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease in lung capacity of 20% to 30% in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-treatment-intensive syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether previous infections confer effective and long-term immunity in people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is considered possible, if one observes the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 recovery followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later have been reported.
This case is believed to be a worsening of the fecal infection, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be naturally occurring and to have originated from animals, through infection that spread.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest symptom detection date was 1 December 2019.
The official publication from WHO reported the earliest symptom awareness on 8 December 2019.
Generally, some measurement is used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for clinically diagnosed or epidemiologically unconfirmed COVID-19 deaths for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-to-case mortality ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) had died.
In Gangelt, the disease is transmitted through the festival of Carnival, which spreads among young people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and it is likely that not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system is not yet overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The pandemic's impact and mortality rate differ for men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies done in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between men and women not apparent until age 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The exact reasons for these sex-based differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reasons.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men having comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female health workers is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is short for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the moment the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming that aim to prevent stigmatisation.
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as provisional names for viruses and diseases in line with 2015 guidelines that advise against using place names in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some manufacturers digitally print health care materials such as nasal wipes and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital badly needed ventilator valves, and the supplier could not deliver them in the required time scale, a local company re-engineered and printed the required 100 valves in one night.
After the onset of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine to treat this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
A vaccine is not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV were used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being studied.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactivated or dead, is intended to rapidly trigger the immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines made with these strategies must be tested to find out their safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Newly targeted antivirals make up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries with a reporting deadline at the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is in place.Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there was tentative evidence for remdesivir's efficacy.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the U.S., China, and Italy.Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there have been calls for a review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that a double dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition Chinese guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Initial data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.Research has shown that early priming of the proton by serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin had major limitations that have prevented the medical community from using these therapies without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in severe advanced COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antithycotoxin properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing phase 2 randomized trials nationally in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to counteract cytokine storms, which are suspected to be the cause of death in some of the people affected.
In 2017, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence to suggest that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a method of passive non-vaccination immunization.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, is in development.
Convalescent serum production, which is the fluid fraction of the blood of a recovered patient and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronary artery disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after becoming aware of the spread of the virus.
