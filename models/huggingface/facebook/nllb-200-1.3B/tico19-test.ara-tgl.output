The rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) disease in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that although the stage varies depending on the country, the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.

On December 31, 2019, a group of pneumonia cases of unknown pathogenic causes were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.

Till then, the illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that about 80% of individuals with COVID-19 are mildly ill; that is, they have respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of these recover.
14% had a severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% had a severe illness requiring intensive care.
The death rate for COVID-19 patients who stayed in hospital was about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in cumulative COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and UK and compare them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.

Get cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the reported COVID-19 cases in every country around the world, which are only available from official sources such as the countries' health ministries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization, daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases with a 14-day interval, and then took into account the normal course of COVID-19 in all EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of cases reported from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., comparing it with the number in Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Covid-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK
The trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases observed over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative COVID-19 number started to increase on around 21 February, then increased sharply on around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown similar trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figura 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is highlighted that as of 15 March at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have reported a total number of cases already similar to that in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are in different stages, and despite the fact that national public health responses vary, and the possibility of differences in country definitions and protocols for selecting patients who should be tested to confirm their COVID-19 status, including follow-up testing.

Data on hospital admissions and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% respectively (data not displayed).

A 2010 study showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and mid-care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.

The modelling scenarios associated with healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK for the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with a risk of &gt;90% to exceed the capacity of the intensive care bed, are available in the sixth update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
e so far the cases have been collected in specific regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and ICUs usually serve specific regional population groups, it is preferable to provide information about cases and ICU at the level of the Regional Statistical Unit Designation 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.


The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

If this fails, the healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has caused more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 injuries in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
SARS-CoV-2,like its sister virus, SARS-CoV,that caused thousands of people to get SARS in 2003,can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.

The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COVID-19) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the related disease was named COVID-19.
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.

The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is the public enemy number one and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.

We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding disease prevention and prediction as well as some urgent questions that are still being raised.
Coronavirus was traditionally considered to be a non-fatal human pathogen, and was primarily responsible for about 15% of the common cold.
Though, in this century we've faced two severe human disease-causing coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries at a terrifying rate of spread and mortality.
Covid-19
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups of unknown origin pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus was released.

nce, the epidemic has rapidly spread to neighboring cities, counties, and countries.

SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but affects people between 30 and 65 years old primarily.
Almost half of those infected (47.7%) were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread amongst groups in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of infection to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction number was 3.77 (confidence range 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the modified baseline reproduction number was 2.23-4.82.

The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (confidence range is 95%: 1.10-1.86%) and the modified mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (confidence range is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).

Coronaviruses are a family of large, enveloped viruses containing a single positive-string DNA repository genome.
They can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and the alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The S-coated fork of the sugar protein binds to its cellular receptors, the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and the Sars-Cov and MERS-Cov dipetayl peptidase 4 (DBP4), respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral ribose DNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the ribose DNA accompanied by glucose envelope proteins and nucleotide capsule proteins forms vesicles containing feroni, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be a new beta-CoV variant with a genetic identity greater than 99.98% among 10 sequenced test samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Sars-CoV-2 is found in extremely thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
It was revealed that the human enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Though, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 with a weaker binding than SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make a short-chain protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and limit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any range or pattern of known function.
On February 18, 2020, Chu et al. reported the full length structure of the human angiotensin-2 converted enzyme under a 2.9 Å ultracold electron microscope within a compound with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had assembled to form a dimer and that the compound ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to protein S, providing clues for coronavirus recognition and infection.
The sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for testing drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and been transmitted to humans via butterflies and camels, respectively.

G and others have suggested that snakes are carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involves a similar recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that ant-eaters - long-tongued ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential host for SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic similarity to the coronavirus detected in ant-eaters and in SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs can survive in the lab for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days in a temperature below 20 degrees Celsius and a humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be sensitive to UV and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxy acetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chloroxide, can effectively inhibit the virus.

In general, after a host virus has invaded, the natural immune system recognizes it through pattern recognition receptors (PRRS) including type C receptor-like kinases, TLR-like receptor, NLR-like receptor, and RIG-I receptor-like protein (RLR).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Though, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from immune responses.
Immunity is rapidly joining the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the biofil to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus infected cells.
T-cell helpers produce inflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
T cell functions are reduced by the coronavirus by inducing programmed T cell death.
Immunity mix, including complement proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, are also essential in fighting viral infection.
,,,,,,,,,,,,
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally free radicals which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and in the worst case, multiple organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2, which first appeared in groups, is more likely to infect elderly people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It's common for people who are exposed to a lot of viruses or whose immune function is impaired to have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The estimated mean SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is 1-14 days, or 3 to 7 days in most cases, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
Though, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate care period, thus preventing infected but symptom-free people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people who are exposed to the virus or are infected are usually asked to undergo a 14-day quarantine.
Do you need to extend the quarantine to 24 days?
THE PRIMARY symptom of COVID-19 is often fever, which may be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, strep throat, runny nose, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or low blood oxygenation within one week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients develop rapidly to have acute respiratory syndrome, infectious shock, metabolic acid, and cataract.
Pasientes con fiebre o con síntomas respiratorios y fiebre severa, aun sin tomografías que revelen anomalías pulmonares, deben ser examinados para detectar el virus para un diagnóstico temprano.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; and 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family and a group that was infected from someone who had no symptoms.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also suffered from fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Diarrhoea (26%) and strep throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it turned out that fever (99-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and strep throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and that about 14%-20% of patients needed respiratory support.

In comparison, the SARS death rate by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mears, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic survey conducted in June 2012.

A comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate, and basal reproduction number is shown in Table Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter.

Patients have normal or low numbers of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, low lymphocyte with 4×109/litre white blood cell count including 1×109/litre lymphocyte count, high levels of the transporter aspartate amine and HIV have been detected in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated liver, muscle, and myoglobin levels, and most patients had elevated C-reactive protein and red blood cell mass.
In severe cases, the level of dimer D, which is caused by the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, is elevated, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreases.
The X-ray anomalies appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-blind shadows or a tinted glass seal in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have non-pattern pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid buildup, and elevated fibrillation severely affect the exchange of gases.
Type 1 and type 2 dysfunction reduce the level of the surface activator and increase the surface tension, and thus, reduce the lung's ability to expand and increase the risk of lung collapse.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal DNA through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PTPCR) has been used as a major criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

On February 14, 2020, Feng Chang Group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based Sherlock technique for SARS-CoV-2 detection, detecting pieces of RNA created for SARS-CoV-2 at a rate from 20 × 10-18 mO/L to 200 × 10-18 mO/L using immersion in less than an hour without the need for precision devices.
We hope that the new technology can improve sensitivity and fitness significantly if it's verified in clinical samples.

Treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.

The cytokine storm is known to be caused by an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute cases.
Tosilezomab, a single-stranded antibody to interleukin 6, was used to treat cytokine storm.
Other cytokine storm suppressor treatments include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; Janus kinase inhibition; Plennatumab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and histone desictilisers.
Stimulants and immunosuppressants have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.

Though, it was discovered that giving Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, intravenously was effective with a US COVID-19 patient.
Remdecivir is a novel antiviral developed by Gilead initially to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Then, Remdesivir also showed potential inhibition for other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.

Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after treatment with the combination of bupinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used with patients should be carefully monitored.

Antibodies are anti-AG globulins produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and target unique molecules in pathogens directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation, reduced viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.

For example, antibodies can stimulate an immune response too much and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treating patients with critical conditions.
It's hard to develop specific antibodies and produce them fast enough to fight a global pandemic.

Though this is a very approximate comparison, many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Chang and his work partners published a study comparing Western Medicine treatment (WM) alone with the combined treatment of Western medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
They found that the time it took to recover from a high body temperature, the symptoms disappearing, and the hospital stay was much shorter in the Western medicine treatment plus traditional Chinese medicine treatment group compared to the Western medicine treatment group alone.
Most impressively, the rate of symptom exacerbation (ranging from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine treatment group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine treatment group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
Though, the effectiveness and safetyof traditional Chinese medicine still awaits further well-studied trials on larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and explain the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.

Immunization strategies against MERS have been developed using inactive virus, deoxygenated DNA plasmids, viral transporters, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of the composite protein, and some of these have been evaluated in animal models.

Though, overcoming the difficulty represents a challenge because of the long time period (average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as a new disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without punishment.

Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the prognosis for SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
Covid-19 was mainly found in the 30-65 age group, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to develop underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not need it (at average age 66 vs. 51), pointing to age as a predictor of outcomes for COVID-19 patients.

Communicable diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and irregular heartbeat.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme in positive bile cells, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are strongly linked and may overlap.
Anormal lab results: The level of CRP in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictor of disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
C-reactive protein levels have also been suggested as a link to the severity of COVID-19 and its life expectancy.

Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced extreme stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counselling and long-term support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features from SARS.

Though, SARS-CoV transmission has been thought to occur when patients are in a severe state of illness, whereas most virus transmissions have not occurred in the early stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.


The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will continue for between 3 and 4 months.
Though, some other experts don't have the same amount of optimism.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which looks much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. have created a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might infect two-thirds of the world's population.

Ebola was originally projected to cause as many as a million cases with half a million deaths.

It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 becomes weaker in causing infection and eventually goes away or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
The SARS/MERS COVID-19 pandemic is compared below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with virus-infected materials.
also found in feces, raising a new possibility for feces to be passed through the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing illnesses and 40 health care providers.

Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and respiratory N95 masks (series 1860s) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from moving through the air or sticking to the surface of materials, where they can be passed on to others.
N95 masks (series number 1860s) can protect from inhalation of small ferrions as much as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of ferrions enabling full penetration; SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARS-CoV in size and each is approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks together, healthcare providers who directly contact patients must wear N95 masks (series number 1860s) but not surgical masks.

Tri feet is a good distance for people to stay away from the patient.
Tis an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.

This message has greatly reduced the alertness of the general public, especially when the whole country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and it is a critical time to contain the disease to its lowest extent in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when releasing public data because every word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; (4) more proactive in releasing targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemics and periodically improve the community response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started at the end of December 2019.

SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are not experiencing symptoms, whereas SARS patients usually do this when they are seriously ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 from SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and much wider than SARS-CoV.
Sars-CoV-2 DNA test can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can contract the virus again.

Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Though we discovered a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
without knowing the answers to my numbers 1 and 2, we can't stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak could come back anytime.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-2 transducer enzyme,how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathogenic changes?
Do the viruses also bind to cells that secrete angiotensin-transfer enzyme 2 in other organs?

The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown the other side to reveal just how dangerous and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought new light to the coronaviruses, and we were surprised by how quickly it spreads but with a greater disease-causing capacity than its SARS-CoV sibling.
HCoVs are animal-derived, so understanding the animal origins of HCoVs would serve us well.

Tracing the animal origins of HCoVs has shown a framework for understanding natural history, the driving force and the limiting factors for interspecies migration.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 warehouse, mediator host and enlarged host animal, with important implications for preventing future fallout.

In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original HCoVs are usually nonpathogenic in their natural host but become pathogenic after they are transferred between species to a new host.
We also review the assessment of the human coronavirus pathway where an increase in transmissibility often accompanies a decrease in severity of disease.
We also discuss in this context the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

In the past decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the detection of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) will be for educational and guidance purposes.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory system of patients with an upper respiratory infection in 1966, and then adapted to live in the WI-38 lung cell line.

both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally, and tend to spread mostly during the winter season in temperate climates.
n general, these two viruses have less than a week of incubation, followed by a feeling of sickness for about two weeks.

Only a few patients with immune deficiency showed severe lower respiratory damage.
SARS, also known as "Lunatic Pneumonia", was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history and its causative agent was SARS-CoV, was the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first SARS case was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.

SARS-CoV symptoms begin with muscle pain, headache, fever, nausea, and chills, followed by late symptoms such as difficulty breathing, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Lymphoma, hepatic dysfunction, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory malfunctions of SARS.
SARS patients also have widespread renal damage, proliferation of the epithelial cells, and increased salivary cell counts.
About 20-30% of patients then need intensive care and artificial respiration.

Human coronavirus-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first found to be common in young children, the elderly, and HIV patients with respiratory diseases.
Cold, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human coronavirus-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a sample from the nose of an eight-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is worldwide.
It is estimated that the human coronavirus-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.

HKU1 has been found to be globally widespread, causing mild respiratory illness, similar to HKU-NL63, HKU-229E, and HKU-OC43.

Mers-Kov was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.

Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 resulting in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, and are characterized by an acute exacerbation of pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also suffered from severe kidney failure, which distinguishes MERS from other HCV-caused diseases.
Over 30% of patients suffer from gastrointestinal infectious symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.

The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern, also referred to as COVID-19.

It should be noted that the death rate in Hubei Province of China is 4.2% while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea can also occur in some people.
Pneumonia
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homogeneity of the nucleotide sequence of 82%, they belong to different branches of the evolutionary gene tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.


First, the human coronaviruses are similar in incubation and the time period of illness.
SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 infection symptoms falls between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 shows features that are more common in community-acquired HCoVs, including having unspecified or mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in SARS-CoV, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns for both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns for both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the transmissibility of community-acquired human coronaviruses.

Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples as in other human coronaviruses.

It is interesting whether SARS-CoV-2 may show seasonal spread as in community-acquired human coronaviruses.
Though, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including the potential for transmission, the pathogenesis mechanism and the sustained spread after human transmission will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
Todos los cuatro coronavirus humanos adquiridos por la comunidad que causan síntomas leves se han adaptado bien a los seres humanos.Todos los cuatro coronavirus humanos adquiridos por la comunidad que causan síntomas leves se han adaptado bien a los seres humanos.
There is another perspective, which may also be true, that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, they might both be survivors of the old HCoV pandemics.
Human coronaviruses, which cause acute illness in humans, have been eliminated as well as humans who have acute HCV illness.
To do this, the human coronaviruses must replicate in humans enough to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter the host's restriction factors.
On this basis, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people get infected, the greater the chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The four community-acquired coronaviruses have been spreading among human populations for many years, causing colds in people with good immunity.

contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs that cause severe human infection have not adapted well, and they have not been able to continue to transmit between humans.
They need to stay in their animal enclosures and breed there and then look for the right opportunity to move to the most vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses.

It is not yet clear whether they will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or intermediate animal host.

An animal is an evolutionary host for the human coronavirus if it harbors a closely related ancestor virus and shares a large similarity in nucleotide sequence.

Similarly, the warehouse host hosts the human coronavirus continuously and for a long time.
In either case, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.

This mediator host can act as an animal source of human infection and also performs the role of amplifier host by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily and thus transmit it to humans to expand the range of infection between humans.

Thanks to the fact that the human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and may even colonize it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural repository host.
                                                                                                                                                                                            
The subsequent pre-exposure surveys indicated that animal dealers had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV IgG compared to normal people.
Palma larvata and the raccoon dog in live animal markets were first identified as carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.

The subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV led to the detection of a closely related bat coronavirus, called HKU3 (HKU3 HKU3 Bat Virus), which is found in Chinese HKU bats.
The SARS-CoV antibody test in these bats and the sequence of the HKU3 yellow-throated Chinese horsehair bat virus associated with acute respiratory syndrome were positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human pathogens.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The human angiotensin-2 transcription enzyme is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 extracted from bat stool sample was shown to use the converted enzyme angiotensin 2 in bats, butterflies, and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, serum from recovers of severe acute respiratory syndrome was able to equate WIV1.


The evolution analysis of the MERS-CoV strains in the bat group of the HKU4 coronavirus and the HKU5 coronavirus in the bat itself.
The HKU4 coronavirus in bats and MERS-CoV uses the same host, bipeptide peptide4, to enter the virus.
The Mers-Kowf RNA-based RNA polymerization sequences are more closely related in strain evolution to its counterparts in bat-coronavirus identified in Europe and Africa.
Merce-Cove has not yet been discovered to live in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and HKU25 are closely related to each other in only 87% of the nucleotide sequences.

On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that only the Sneam camel has positive serum for MERS-CoV antibodies, and camels are also of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The live Mers-Kopf neighborhood matching the virus in humans was isolated from nasal swabs of the monotypic camel, suggesting that the camel serves as the original Mers-Kopf warehouse host.
It is also worth noting that mild symptoms have generally appeared in Jamal who was experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but a dense viral spread has been observed.
Infected camels were spreading the viruses remarkably not only by breathing but also through the oral anus, which is the primary route for the spread of the virus from bats.

SARS-CoV-2 RaTG13 in horseshoe-tailed bats is 96.2% nucleotide-like.
The sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine a relationship to the father, as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii


The genomes of this ant-eater coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share 85-92% of the same nucleotide sequences.
They are, however, closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide sequences.

In stark contrast, the binding regions of SARS-CoV-2 receptors differ significantly from RaTG13, although the overall genome sequence homology is higher.
A previous study on a sick stinging ant revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, and it turned out that they were similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used various assembly methods and manual processing to generate a partial genome sequence that consists of the entire viral genome at approximately 86.3% length.
We can't rule out the possibility that the scavenger is one of the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.

It is a matter of conjecture that the high degree of similarity between the binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in beta-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 antagonists is selectively approximate.
There is a proposed recombination between SARS-CoV-2 in the bite of the beta-coronaviruses and RaTG13 in the wild species III.
Re-composition is widespread among beta coronaviruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.

The bat coronavirus, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Highlands Coronavirus), detected in the North American trilobite, has been reported to be closely related to human coronavirus-NL63.

To illustrate, the current information on the animal origins of known HCoVs has been summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.

Alpha coronaviruses in alpaca are among them.

First, humans and not alpacas might have contact with bats in a common ecological habitat.
whereas humans have a close relationship with alpacas.
Two, the human coronavirus-229E of the bat coronaviruses is multi-pathogenic and disease-causing in bats, whereas the alpaca coronavirus causes outbreaks of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha corona virus associated with alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Alpaca is not known to be infected with human corona virus-229E.
Bates are the direct source of viruses that cause disease in humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Handra virus.

Merce-Cove is a great example of transition between species, moving from bats to unicorns and from unicorns to humans.
The evolutionary origin of Mers-Cove from bats has been known since its early identification and has also been reinforced by later results.
Bloodleafsprovide a rich collection of virus speciesfor exchanging genetic bits within a species and transferring them between species.
Bates are long-lived, live in crowded colonies, have close social interactions, and are highly capable of flight, all of which make them ideal "virus spreaders".
On the other hand, Mears-Cove has moved to the only beauty that has stayed for decades.

Mers-Cof is a very mild disease and keeps the mutation rate relatively low in these animals.
The intermittent transmission to humans remains by chance and humans are a non-transmitter host for MERS-CoV where its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the ant-eater, if present, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the beta coronaviruses associated with the eating of the ant-swallowing make him very ill.
They may be non-transmitters for SARS-CoV-2 of the beta coronaviruses, much like the butter cat in SARS-CoV.
Future studies will determine many possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from animal species to humans either by confirming or ruling it out.
First, bats might be a host to a SARS-CoV-2 related virus, which is most likely identical to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, the ant-eater may be one of the intermediate enlarger hosts for the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 related virus.

It is likely that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a reason to test for antibodies in pets and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, perhaps SARS-CoV-2 has been reassembled and adapted into a third type that has contact with bats and anthurium.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
First, mutation rates are relatively high in the replication of the DNA ribosome.
The estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses, compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average shift rate of ~10-4 cases per year for site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronaviruses to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have an exogenous ribonuclease, which causes it to be highly mutable and degraded or unable to evolve.
Remdesivir isotope is known for its ability to inhibit replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting the enzyme exogenous ribonuclease and RNA-based ribose DNA polymerase.

Plus, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses don't adapt properly to the host.
SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate compared to SARS-CoV-2 with a higher mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to the single-celled camel.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift would help vaccines and antiviral drugs to resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the massive ribosome DNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides additional donuts in genome editing for mutation and reassembly, thereby increasing the likelihood of co-evolution between species, which favors the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become right for it.
This is supported by the unique abundant open reading templates and protein functions encoded near the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly change patterns during replication of ribosome DNA through unique "replication selection" mechanism.Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly change patterns during replication of ribosome DNA through unique "replication selection" mechanism.Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly change patterns during replication of ribosome DNA through unique "replication selection" mechanism.Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly change patterns during replication of ribosome DNA.Third, coronaviruses replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate.Third, coronaviruses replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate.Third, coronaviruses replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate replicate.
In a host that's like a mixing bowl, the sequencing happens repeatedly during replication of the ribosome DNA of the coronavirus.
High-symmetry full-length and secondary RNAs may reassemble to generate new coronaviruses.

Interactions with the host associated with transmission

In this regard, we take the SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which also showed evidence for positive selection during transitional events.
Based on comparative analysis of isolated SARS-CoVs in humans and butterflies, it was thought that SARS-CoVs undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations occurring in the binding domain of S-protein receptors.
Typically, the binding domain of the S-receptor for the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensively selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the binding domain of the amino acid receptors 318 to 510 occurs in the S1 region, which binds to the angiotensin 2 transcription enzyme in addition to the helper receptors for virus entry.
The receptor binding domain in SARS-CoV is able to identify the fates of the enzyme that converts angiotensin 2 to help in various animals, including bats, butterflies, mice, and raccoons, allowing for the transmission of the virus between species.
actually, only 6 amino acid residues were identified that were different from the virus isolates from humans and butterflies in the receptor binding domain, and 4 of them are in the receptor binding sequence pattern to interact with the angiotensin 2 transforming enzyme receptor.
K479N and S487T mutations are present in the binding domain of SARS-CoV receptors in butterflies, which could increase the likelihood of spike protein interaction in the future of the human angiotensin-2 transforming enzyme.
In other words, these two types of amino acid substitutes may be of importance for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in the S1 unit of S protein, implicitly indicating that the S protein binding potential in the human angiotensin-2 transducer enzyme has changed.
actually, a study with the ultracold electron microscope indicated a 10 to 20 times higher probability of this binding than what happens between the human angiotensin 2 transducer enzyme and the S protein in SARS-CoV.
It's also interesting to determine if any other type of helper receptor might be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
It is also interesting that the human coronavirus-NL63 also binds to the angiotensin 2 transducer enzyme but in a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoVs, such as HCoV-229E's N-protein analyzer, and HCoV-OC43's 9-O-associated sialic acid.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after transitioning between species from their animal hosts.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The diffusion of these host proteins between humans and the hosts of the natural repositories of coronaviruses, such as bats, sloths, and rodents, may be an obstacle to transmissions between species.
HCoVsmust control host dependence factors and weaken its restraint factorsto carry out successful transition between species.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this critical space for the virus' interaction with the host remain detectable and characterizing.
The extensive, unbiased genome screening can be used to look for reliance factors and host constraints for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced CRISPR technology.
The emergence of new human coronaviruses: back to the beginning

Among the regulatory proteins for SARS-CoV, ORF8 was thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoVs associated with viruses was isolated in bats but found to encode differentiated ORF8 proteins.

This deletion may have led to ORF8 being split into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.

also identified recombination sites in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, research has shown that the Mers-Coeuf outbreak has seen re-combination cases between different strains, which occurred in the only snake camel in Saudi Arabia.

It should be noted that artificial selection can also aid in unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from the release of viruses from selective stresses, such as those produced by the host immune system.
The loss of the ORF4 protein in the HCoV-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Though normal ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca coronaviruses show only one nucleotide suture, leading to a liner frame mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective stress in their warehouse hosts.

showed that bats adapted appropriately to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, weak activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats has effectively reduced the pathogens caused by coronaviruses.
Additionally, natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to increased rate of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and decreased level of expression of the class I major tissues compatibility molecule.

Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in host hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate aggressively without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
Then there are the secrets to why we see asymptomatic carriers and why severe cases of infection in humans.
The more intense the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the contrary, in the case of the unsymptomatic carriers, the immune response is detached from the replication of the coronavirus.
Similar to the immune response isolation strategy, it may have beneficial effects in the anti-COVID-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.

Beta-coronavirus has been detected in ant-eater which is highly identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that ant-eater animals may be one of the intermediate hosts or that beta-coronavirus in ant-eater ants may have contributed to genetic cuts leading to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.

Coronaviruses have come back into focus with the start of the latest SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the importance of animal origin pathogens and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.

On the other hand, Myrce-Kow has been found in the beauty of the swan for a long time.

They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Then it's impossible to sacrifice all the beauty to control MERS, much like what officials at wildlife markets in China have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Especially, the coronavirus in bats is so diverse that it has the potential to cause animal-derived diseases.
There are many opportunities for animal-related coronaviruses to evolve and reassemble, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or lethal in humans in the future.


The fact is that many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural reservoirs until they have a chance to spread and reproduce.
Though bats have many characteristics that tend to spread viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that requires them to stay away from them.

To conclude, the best way to prevent animal-borne viral diseases is to keep humans away from the natural habitat of animal-borne viruses.
The mystery of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains surrounded by many questions that require answers.
First, if bats transmit the original SARS-CoV-2 to an ant eater, it's important to know the conditions that set the bats and ant eater up for sharing the same environment.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of disease to humans, then the way humans interact with them should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammal is the true mediator host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and ant-eaters.
Finally, since many mammals including pets may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be performed.

Though the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; and therefore diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️


has received immense attention since its publication.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice; and therefore diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (/http://www.nhc.gov.cn) COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, a total of seven editions were released with some contexts substantially changed.
Our guideline now has a comment from Chow and others, who suggested a simple score monitoring based on clinical experience.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidance and have also become a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We applaud their great effort and express our appreciation.

According to the seventh release (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case needs to combine any one of the features of the epidemiological history and two elements of clinical manifestations to arrive at a comprehensive analysis, or needs to verify three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiologic history: (1) a history of traveling to, or staying in, Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities with reported cases of COVID-19 within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive DNA test results); (3) a history of contact with fever or respiratory symptoms patients from Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities with reported cases of COVID-19 within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with infections from infected persons (2 or more cases), such as from small school, office, or other places where symptoms occurred.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on the suspected case involving any of the following elements of evidence of pathogenicity or serum interactions: (1) positive for SARS-CoV-2 in real time PCR; (2) high homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence with known novel coronavirus characteristics; (3) positive serum IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG test results; or the IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody change from negative to positive, or the recovery-stage calibration elevation is equal to or greater than 4 times that level.
We see that the real-time DNA polymerase sequencing test in respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Detection of pathogens in blood sample was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth edition (February 8, 2020); the Blood Serum Interaction Guide was then added to the seventh edition.
These modifications have relied on the researchers' ongoing work to design an ideal suite of DNA-based detection tools for rapid diagnosis, plus respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which has led to increased availability of different samples, and support for transferring the positive result of the antigen to the confirmed case criteria.
Besides, there's growing evidence that we should be cautious when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and non-symptomatic conditions.
So, the content of the information flow chart for Cho and others, where they classified a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk", should be updated.
The score monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.


Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh has recorded five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths yesterday.
THE WARP: This is the highest number of deaths in one day from the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, the number of registered cases has reached 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases were residing at home.
17 fatalities have been recorded.
Director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadie Sabrina Flora, said in an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirjadhi, there were two cases over 60 years, two cases between 51 and 60 years, and one case between 41 and 50 years.
She also said that two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on the 11th of March.



The transport of basic goods, namely medical products, fuel and food, is still permitted.


SARS-CoV-2 infections have exceeded a million worldwide.
Data from Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus has exceeded one million cases worldwide.

Australia's stores are lowering their toilet paper per transaction
Australia's Wallworths and Coles retail chains tightened restrictions on toilet paper purchases on Saturday and Sunday evening to reduce it to two rolls from Wallworths and one roll from Coles stores per transaction at all stores nationwide.
also selected Aldi stores for one roll, and that was on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at the checkout points of the chain stores and on their Facebook pages.

Wal-Whirts on Wednesday passed restrictions on toilet paper delivery to homes to one wrapper per purchase order.

Cools Stores in its press release on March 8 reported that despite the application of the four-wrap restrictions, "many stores still sell all they have within one hour of receipt", and described the order as "unprecedented", as did Aldi Stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as "unpredictable".
"Sale has gone up" in the past week, according to a spokesperson for Wal-Worth stores.
The Costco store in Canberra also stated last week that the allowed quantity to buy is two waffles.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles stores asked suppliers for larger rolls and increased delivery rates, and Wall-Worth stores requested additional stock, while Aldi stores opened their stock for specials scheduled for early Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on the delivery time of trucks are making it difficult.


Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, reported in a report for News.com.au that stores are filling up every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, which leads to a lower inventory in terms of numbers, and when it's sold out, it leaves a lot of empty space on the shelves, which reinforces the feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman, as reported by ABC News, stated: "Cools and Wallworths have a view that if there are lots of items on the shelves, and if you can [buy] and stock items like toilet paper and sterilizers, that might reduce the panic".
Who Gives a Crap, a company that produces recycled toilet paper, reported last Wednesday that their stock is out.

Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some real estate sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder in Melbourne auctions, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a Darwin daily, included eight-page folded ads made so they could be cut and used as toilet paper.

Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including vacuums, sterilizers, dry goods, hand washing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that a British online store called Okado was listing buyers of Andres toilet paper with two 12-wrap bottles.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 - a disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome (ACRS) -related coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 - has reached pandemic level.

"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
"If countries detect and test people, treat them, isolate them, track their cases and mobilize for confrontation", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are all very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and danger as well as the levels of inaction that warn of danger".
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
"No other respiratory virus has been traced from its onset to its ongoing global spread, apart from influenza", he said in a statement released by CNN in February.
Gebresos expressed a similar view, saying: "We've never been exposed to a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
"n't seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the decision of the World Health Organization in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: "The bottom line is that things are going to get worse".
Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide as of Thursday, and over 4,600 deaths.

364,000 people have recovered.
China has a mortality rate of 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.

Treatment is supportive and symptomatic.The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, monitoring, and self-isolation of those suspected of being infected.

The pandemic led to severe global social and economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the world's student population.

As a result of reduced travel rates and closure of heavy industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.


The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronaviruses, the ant-eater coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person with symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and that this person had no apparent contact with the wet market group that was later discovered.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report published by the South China Morning Post indicated that a case dating back to 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, may have been the first case. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although new cases reported in China were down, they rose sharply in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases within it for the first time.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.

                                                                                                                                                                                



The initial estimates of the basal reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it might be 5.7.
Most people who get COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the period from the deterioration of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.


The real number of COVID-19 deaths may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without being tested - for example, at home, in a nursing home, etc.

Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.

These statistics have no time frame and follow a specific population from infection to knowledge of the condition.
Academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain population groups.
Oxford University's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate for this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and with a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on estimates of case mortality.
The World Health Organization confirms that the pandemic is under control.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
"Infectious disease outbreaks that go uncontrolled usually peak and then start to decline when the disease finds no hosts available", states Massage Bonney of Pennsylvania State University.

"It could be over by June" if all countries can be motivated to follow WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kocharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 "will be prevalent for perhaps a year or two".

William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University, said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will go away completely because it's so easily transmitted", and it could "become a seasonal disease that comes back every year".
The severity of the return will depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific and may not show symptoms in those who are infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The CDC in the United States has limited emergency symptoms to difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bruising of the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.

China estimates the proportion of asymptomatic cases to be between a few and 44%.
The typical incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; often it is five days. As an example of the confusion state, the estimated proportion of COVID-19 patients who have lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and has recently fallen to 15%.

It is thought that the disease is spread mainly during mixing or by spraying when coughing, sneezing or talking; this is when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without covering your mouth can cause a spray that spreads 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some think that the virus might also be transmitted by long-term airborne spraying, which may be produced during talking. It may also produce respiratory spraying during the process of vomiting, including when talking, although the virus is not generally transmitted through the air.
The spray may fall on the mouth or nose of people nearby or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as tubal therapy and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray and then cause airborne spread.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his/her eyes, nose, or mouth.

The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from feces to the mouth. The virus is most infectious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
The disease has been confirmed in people up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that it may be transmitted before severe symptoms appear.

The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that although there is some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, a single person can generally infect two to three others. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, it's been found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on polypropylene plastic and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.

There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, UK authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, as well as when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, first isolated from three people with mixed pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all its characteristics with naturally occurring coronaviruses. Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus, dissolving its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Supposedly of animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically interbred with the beta coronavirus genus, and falls under the subgenus of the SARS-CoV (B strain) plus two strains of bat origin.

The comparison of the entire genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92% genetic similarity between ant-eater coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that ant-eater is the mediator of this virus.
Virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, although confirmation is eventually made by reverse transcription polymerase sequencing (RT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography.
A study in Wuhan comparing the interaction of polymerase chain reaction and computed tomography indicated that computed tomography is more sensitive than the interaction of polymerase chain reaction, although it is less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interacting with pneumonia and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiography recommends "no use of computed tomography for detection of COVID-19 or as a preliminary screening for diagnosis".
The World Health Organization published several protocols for SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal DNA testing, for the first time on January 17.
The test uses the reaction of polymerase chain reverse transcription (RT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on samples from the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally done by means of a nasal swab, and a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing oral tests that detect antibodies.

The selective test developed by Silex has been approved for emergency use in the United States only in approved laboratories.
The characteristics of X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetrical edema such as blurred glass and distorted crystal bulge.
The Italian Radiation Society is compiling an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiography without polymerase chain reaction is a limited accuracy method for detecting COVID-19, due to its interaction with other diseases such as GV infections.

Neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the imaging properties of the virus in both X-ray and CT imaging.

We recommend that those who are already infected wear a medical mask in public.

This means that the virus spreads within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they have been infected. Health care providers, who care for someone who is potentially infected, are advised to use appropriate precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracing is an effective way for health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its spread.

Users then receive a message if they approach someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. It promotes misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, washing the nose and mouthwashing is not a viable solution.

It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when there is rust on their hands, before eating, after emptying their nose, coughing or sneezing.
because household soap kills the virus outside the body, where it destroys its protective membrane.
Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also recommended using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when water and soap are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
71% ethanol,100% isopropanol,0.1% sodium hypochlorite,0.5% hydrogen peroxide,0.2% iodopophedone.

CDC recommends that if someone is suspected or confirmed to have COVID in an establishment such as an office or a care center, all places such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, and common electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommend people cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing either bend the elbow and put it in front of their mouth and nose or use a paper towel and get rid of any towels immediately.
The risk of infection is recommended to use medical masks, as wearing masks reduces the volume of respiratory spray and the distance it travels when it is spread by talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the desire [of people] to touch their face, which is a major source of infection if they do not wash their hands properly".
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people should not wear masks unless they are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a non-medical cloth face mask. China specifically recommended healthy people to use disposable medical masks, especially in direct contact with people (at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places. Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government made it mandatory for everyone who enters a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has required train passengers and intercity buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama made wearing a face mask when out, with also recommending making face masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.

Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without contact, and physically distancing from others.

The maximum size of gatherings recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 spread was detected in the area) to 50 people, and 10 people later.

The use of the term "social distancing" has suggested that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

It is recommended that people with COVID-19 and those who are suspected of having it self-isolate at home.


We recommend that those who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted self-quarantine for 14 days before the last possible exposure.

Containment is applied in the early stages of an outbreak and is aimed at tracking and isolating those infected as well as introducing other measures to control infection and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is impossible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and the community.


Then you can reduce the risk of stress for health services and save more time for developing vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may treat the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large gathering events; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.Tougher measures aimed at containing the outbreak in China were taken once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as curbing the quarantine on entire cities and imposing a strict travel ban.

Korea downgraded to mass screening and local quarantine, and issued warnings about the movements of the infected.
Singapore has provided financial support to those who have isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has been depleting medical supplies.Simulations of Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic, not stopping it) and containment (reversing the growth of the epidemic) are facing significant challenges.
optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and stress on health systems.

Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.

Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids and rest may help to relieve symptoms.
depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, venous fluid, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.

The World Health Organization also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" can provide relief for the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.

The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO European Regional Office issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating elective procedures where possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of artificial respirators and beds available.
There are multiple theories about where the first case originated (called Patient Zero).

Universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
Hong Kong and Macau have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.

Travel restrictions have been imposed on travel in and out of Hobby.


For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all returnees to the city from other countries. On 23 March, one case was locally transmitted in mainland China during the past five days, via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.

Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas at the Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to resume work on 30 March, and offered a set of cash incentives for businesses. The State Council declared a day of mourning beginning with a three-minute silence on 4 April at 10:00 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to show their respect online in keeping with physical distancing to avoid a further outbreak of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a sharp increase in confirmed cases on February 20, and this is largely attributed to the gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.

She stated that there is a high risk of spreading the virus in enclosed places like prisons, which also lack adequate medical care.




It is also believed that US sanctions on Iran may affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for easing economic sanctions on the countries most affected by this pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on January 31, when SARS-CoV-2 tests of Chinese tourists in Rome came back positive.


Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "He will not be allowed to enter or leave the outbreak zones.


On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all business activities, except for supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Sedation, Rehabilitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding the screening protocols that could be used.



CNN report noted that a combination of a large number of older adults and the inability to test all those infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the higher death rate.
UK response to the virus first emerged as being the most lax among affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government has not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its notable lack of speed and intensity in responding to concerns faced by the public.

Though doing so, the US slowed down in starting testing, obscuring the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test spoiled a defective test kit produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor's order was required after that).


On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who have had symptoms and have a doctor's order have waited hours or days to be tested". After the first death in the United States was reported in Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, a measure that was quickly followed by other states.




The next day, restrictions were extended to the UK and Ireland.
On March 13, he declared a national emergency, which allowed for the use of federal funds to respond to the crisis.





On the same day, the USS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, docked in New York.

Jack Ma, a businessman, sent to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits, which the African Union took over for distribution.
He later sent to Panama 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 artificial respirators.

Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.

The WHO praised the Chinese authorities' efforts in managing and containing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization has noted the difference between the 2002 and 2004 SARS outbreaks, with Chinese authorities being blamed for the blackout that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, with the central government providing "regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Goden Gallia noted that while this was "certainly not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is heavily concentrated", and described it as "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after confirmation of transmission from person to person outside China, and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth case of serious public health concern since the first such outbreak was reported during the 2009 Infectious Diseases Surveys.
The WHO Director-General said that the outbreak is an international public health emergency due to "the risk of global spread, particularly in low and middle income countries that do not have robust health systems.


Tedros also made statements announcing that "our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest person in us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a big price later". On February 11, the WHO, at a press conference, named the disease, COVID-19.

As a result, a UN Crisis Management Team was set up, allowing for the coordination of the entire UN response, and will allow WHO to "focus on the health response while drawing on the expertise of other agencies to understand the broader social, economic, and developmental impacts of the outbreak".
On February 14, a joint WHO-led mission team was set up with China to bring international experts and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist with local management and assess the "severity and transmissibility of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and city level, including urban and rural areas". On February 25, WHO announced that "the world should do more to be alert for a potential coronavirus pandemic", noting that since it was previously described as a pandemic, countries should only be "in the recovery phase".

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO's Emergency Health Programme, warned in a statement that "this is a real test for every government on earth: so we need to be prepared.
"This virus may be on its way and you must be prepared for it", he urged for the right response measures that can help the world avoid "what is worse".
Ryan also stated that the current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease as a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means "we are basically accepting that every human being on this planet will be exposed to this virus".

The WHO "is deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction", the WHO said. The WHO has faced heavy criticism for what is seen as inadequate handling of the pandemic, including delayed declaration of a public health emergency, and classification of the virus as a pandemic.

Borell also said, "China is pushing strongly a message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner".

RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects the ribosome DNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal DNA.
Used to confirm very recent or active injury cases.
Antibody detection (vascular science) is used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Tests of antibodies show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who showed no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined depending on the results of this test.



The use of instantaneous sequential polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasal sputum or plum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR performed using throat scans is only reliable in the first week of illness.
The virus may then disappear from the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are being tested in the second week, a sample from the deep airways can instead be taken by suction catheter or use of a cough suppressant (plum).

UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech also developed a PCR-based PowerChek Coronavirus detector for SARS-CoV-2 suitable for safe clinical use on 28 January 2020.

A March 2020 review of studies concluded that "Radiographic imaging of the chest has little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT results may be clear even before symptoms appear".
The usual features seen in CT include multi-spaced bi-sided tempered glass seals with a perimeter, asymmetrical and backward distribution.

A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and CT imaging regarding the origin of the current epidemic indicated that PCR is more sensitive than CT imaging, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interacting with pneumonia and other stages of disease.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiography recommends "not using computed tomography for detection of COVID-19 or as a preliminary screening for diagnosis of the disease". In March 2020, the CDC recommends using PCR for preliminary screening.

They can be used to detect individuals' infection within a period starting 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immunity, and in case of population monitoring. Analysis can be done in central laboratories (CLTs) or by point-of-care (POCT) testing.
Systems with high performance in many clinical labs will be able to perform these analyses, but how much they can do will depend on the output rate of each system.
For central labs, one sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although it is possible to use sequential samples to follow up the immune response.
For point of care testing, one blood sample is usually drawn through a skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction step is not required before testing.

The test takes several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR analysis of viral ribosome DNA.

Hong Kong has developed a plan whereby patients suspected of being infected can stay at home, "giving the emergency department a sample tube to the patients", spitting into the tube, and returning it again to get the test result a short time later. The NHS has announced that it is piloting a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus eliminating the risk of infection from those infected upon arrival at the hospital or the need to sterilise the used ambulance.
South Korea's car-scanning centers have enabled a range of the fastest and most comprehensive tests globally. In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that they were able to conduct about 12,000 daily tests for outpatients and 10,700 people were tested in the past week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance if a doctor orders the test.



A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting from calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested until the end of week 12/2020, with 33,491 samples (6.9%) being positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital invented a method to test samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and tested that method by collecting samples and not doing further testing unless the group sample turned out to be positive. In Wuhan, BGI opened a proprietary laboratory for detecting the case of leprosy with a 2000 square meter eyepiece called "Huo-Yan Fire" (in English: "Fire", in English: Fire), which can test over 10,000 samples in 2020.[13]

The WHO has adopted the German plan for the manufacture of kits that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own kits.
The German plan was announced on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the US. China and the US faced problems with the reliability of early-onset testing kits, and these two countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet demand and follow the testing recommendations made by health experts.

The South Korean government has greatly enhanced testing capacity in private laboratories over the years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for intensified testing programs as the best solution to limit the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the United States, defects were found in the test kits developed by CDC; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the test from being carried out in particular. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to failure to collect samples or not using the equipment properly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw from purchasing kits that gave incorrect results, and would replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.

Soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired from previous uses.
The few studies that have observed bacterial transmission from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely because bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still states that "liquid soap is preferable to non-touch devices for soap injection".
Antibacterial soaps are being heavily promoted to health-conscious consumers.

Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on hands.
Disinfectant or hand sanitizer is a non-water-based material for cleaning hands.

Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compounded with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer acrylic acid) in gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germicidal.
Alcohol-based rubbing sterilizers kill bacteria, drug-resistant polybacterium (methycillin-resistant golden-cluster bacteria and funkomycin-resistant intestinal bacteria), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory myeloma, nasal viruses, mumps, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol-containing sterilizers with 70% alcohol through rubbing kill 99.97% (logarithmic reduction of 3.5, similar to decreased by 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hands after 30 seconds of application and 99.99% to 99.999% (logarithmic reduction of 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands after 1 minute of application. Hand sterilizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.Alcohol hand sanitizer or rubbing should be used enough to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
Rub the front and back of the hands and between all the fingers and their edges for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.

Alcohol can reduce or eliminate dry skin by adding glycerin or other paracetamol or both to the composition.Alcohol can reduce or eliminate dry skin by adding glycerin or other paracetamol or both to the composition.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing umbrellas cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial cleansers.
Rarely, allergic pleural dermatitis, pleural syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcohol hand washing products occur.
The lower incidence of I.P.I. has become a factor of attraction over handwashing with soap and water.

The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on the ingredients and composition, and historically it has been significantly less effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizer which relies on alcohol rubbing.
Recently, compounds using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent antimicrobial effect after use, unlike alcohol which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.

Ash or dust might be more effective than water alone, but it might be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Ashes, like soap, are a detergent because they form an alkaline solution when they touch water.
WHO recommends using ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
The US Centers for Disease Control recommends proper handwashing to prevent the transmission of disease, including the following steps:
Water is water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing pools may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature doesn't seem to make a difference.
Make foam on hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.

The purpose of washing hands in health care is to remove disease-causing microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing is still at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to routinely wash their hands before touching patients, which transmits microorganisms.
One study showed that washing hands properly and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization published a paper on how to wash hands and rub them in healthcare sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guideline provided by the organisation can also be found on its website available for public comment.

Promoting handwashing with soap can influence and advocate for it in policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term population behavior change.
To make this work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in lower middle-income countries, whereas social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum criteria are met, schools can go from one star to eventually three stars.

few studies have looked at the effectiveness of total handwashing cost in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people going through critical conditions such as newborns or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Agnath Simmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishman Florence Nightingale "founder of modern nursing".
Most people back then still believed that infection was caused by a nasty smell called miasma.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne and healthcare-associated infections prompted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important method to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, "correct ways to wash hands" signs have been hung next to hand washing toilets in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
"Washing hands from" means to declare that one does not wish to take responsibility for something or to participate in it.


It was also found that people, after they pointed out or thought about immoral actions, tended to wash their hands more than others, and tended to appreciate hand washing devices more.

The symbolic washing of hands, using water without the presence of soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual washing of hands that has appeared in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Tiwilla, washing of hands in Judaism, washing of hands in Christianity and the Hajj in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after every meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls at the Workplace

The right workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the job assignment, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the risk of disease in the community, and the risk factors that threaten working individuals who may be at risk of COVID-19.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work involves minimal contact with the public and other coworkers, where basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing coughing and sneezing etiquette, and maintaining routine workplace cleaning and disinfection practices.

DHS considers health care workers and mortuaries who have been exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 person to be at high risk levels, which increases the risk of exposure to extremely high levels if the workers are carrying out aerial breathing procedures, or sampling or handling collections from a known or suspected COVID-19 person.

COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects on the workplace.


Finally, the COVID-19-affected geographical areas may stop shipping goods. The Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community spaces, and risk factors for individual workers such as ageing or chronic medical conditions.
It also defines the controls needed to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Planes de preparedness et de réponse aux maladies infectieuses peuvent être soumis à des recommandations nationales ou non nationales.

The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.

PPE
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, appropriate fit as appropriate (e.g. respirators), continuous and proper wearing, regularly checked, maintained and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored, or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs involving less risk involve a minimum of contact with the public and other coworkers.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until the fever, signs of fever, and any other symptoms are gone for at least 24 hours without the use of fever medication or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies be flexible, that employees be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, moderately high-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) with individuals who are not known to have or suspected to have COVID-19, but may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission of infection in the workplace community, or due to a person's recent international travel to a location where COVID-19 transmission is widespread.
This includes workers who interact with the general public as in schools, work environments with high workload, and some large retail locations. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezers, and installation of outlets to serve customers who shop without leaving the car. Administrative controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing meetings with virtual contacts, establishing regularly scheduled shifts, stopping illegal activities, including the use of illegal drugs, increasing access to the workplace, developing new products or services, and reducing the use of personal protective equipment, including the use of hazardous substances or chemicals.

Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and sterilized afterwards.For commercial cargo, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel when sick, self-isolation and reporting to the onboard medical centre immediately if a person develops fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the ideal case, follow-up should be done in the isolate person's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person is in the school building regardless of spread in the community.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When there is a large transmission of infection in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school leaving dates can be considered.

In case of direct contact during detention, the staff should clean and disinfect the work belts and tools before reuse using a spray or housekeeping wipes, follow the standard work procedures for dealing with pollution and disposing of used personal protective equipment and collecting and washing clothes.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers that some health care and mortuary workers fall into categories with high or very high risk levels.


The procedure for generating air vapour includes tubing, coughing procedures, cane specimens, some dental procedures and tests, or collecting endothelial samples.

Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and corpse storage facilities.
Samples must be handled with level 3 biosecurity precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating incoming patients in separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends using respirators for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients, and those performing airway respiration procedures.
In the United States, respirators with a face mask fitted with an N95 filter, certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better, must be used in the context of the comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes installation testing, fitness testing, training, and medical examinations.
OMS do not recommend using hooks, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted via body fluids.
WHO recommends that surgical masks be worn only at the entry point.
WHO recommends that those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, care for them, or transport them without any procedures to generate airborne breath, use a surgical mask, protective glasses, or a face shield, a syringe, and glasses.

Last week, someone sent me a letter expressing their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is that the world is moving towards Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism that this vital resource is still available online and accessible to all individuals.
eur efforts have made it possible, whether it's by keeping the websites running, or getting our colleagues paid, or keeping our communities safe.
The world is in desperate need of the information available on Wikipedia now more than ever.
s a moment when we're having a positive impact on the world not just by the efforts we make, but also by the way we make them.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're making major adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Modifications to working methods and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our method and our schedule for the next few days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we thought might be the right response to what we were facing, and the ideal way to keep the organization running during this time.
We wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and support our mission for the long term.
if you want to reduce the burden and tasks, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We're not announcing a holiday, so if you're able to work longer than your usual working hours, you might add your efforts to the task.

Tis to be understood to allow this without expressing it, but we do mention it.
You don't need to take sick leave or paid leave.You just need to inform your boss and help your team review the calendars and schedules to make sure the main areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor diagnoses you with COVID-19 and you are positive, please tell Brian at the Department of Training and Certification so that the Department of Training and Certification can help provide support and make sure you get the proper care from the Department.)

We've already mentioned this, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.

if you want to work, we'll support you.

What we can do will be incredibly productive, especially during times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We only ask you to contact your manager so that he can know what to expect and adjust the procedure accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things we need to keep going.

We'll begin a process of working with all departments to evaluate the current goals and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to accomplish our mission.
There's a lot of work we all need to do, and we'll just focus on the most important projects.
Today, we're going to slow down. It won't hurt us later.
We don't plan to double down on the past after the pandemic.

We accept that these circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timelines when it becomes appropriate.
What happens in the APP?
To accommodate the new reality and the daily working hours, we intend to modify the delivery schedule for our 2020-2021 annual planning.
We intend to propose extending our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize the important work, self care and caring for loved ones while aligning the situations of those who need to work on a reduced work schedule or want to, over the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule eases the burden of the current planning work and the pressure across the entire organization.
We'll submit our proposal to the board next week and we'll update delegates and teams on next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the annual planning team for their pioneering role in this.

We learned last week that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
,,,,...............................................................................................................................................
The team used hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all the surfaces, plus the hallway and the elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building has implemented its own duty of care protocol using products that support tenants' safety.
We feel comfortable that the office has been properly prepared for the time we decide to return to work.
Our Washington, D.C. office is in a WeWork building, which shared their COVID-19 protocols with us and with all of our team members at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C., office moved to a completely remote location in common with our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues at our New York City headquarters know, we've been having a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.

Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time teleworking colleagues know that it might be a modification, and they'd like to give you some advice:
The meeting time should be set at a maximum of one hour or gradually increased to two hours.

Should clearly define the meeting, prepare the agenda, and send the reading materials in advance.
Video should be the default solution, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
The initiative should be to facilitate each meeting, with someone monitoring the conversation to see the questions and follow the list of speakers, and someone else to help take notes (or carry out the collaborative note-taking process).

The HR Operations team is looking for user-friendly meeting-based guidance, to support the increase in distributed work across our organization.

We told them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions might make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities, and that no one would be fined for having to delay or modify these goals.
We will release next week additional follow-up guidance for Wikimedia and other regional community conferences with specific themes.

ACE2 binds to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, as well as the intestine.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (AMCE) works by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is also an entry point for some types of coronaviruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a metallic enzyme containing the element zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme protein 2 contains an M2-scale peptide with an amino end, and a colectrain carboxyl end that is a carrier for renal amino acids.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type 1 single-pass membrane protein, and has active enzyme receptors found on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The outer cell range of angiotensin-2 transducer is separated from the transcranial range by an enzyme called shidas, resulting in a protein release that is soluble in the bloodstream and then excreted in the urine.
The enzyme converted angiotensin 2 is found in most organs of the body: it is bound to the cell membrane of type 2 lymphocytes in the lungs, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, and the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the smooth muscle cells of the artery wall in most organs.
Angiotensin 2 transcriptional RNA is found in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, the subclavian region, and the brainstem.
The primary function of angiotensin 2 is to act as a catalyst for angiotensin 2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 which is a blood vessel suppressor.
The carboxyl endpoint containing the amino acid phenylalanine is then separated from angiotensin 2 (aspartate-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenylalanine) and converted into angiotensin (1-7), (histidine-aspartate-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenylalanine).
Angiotensin 2 is converted into a number of other peptides including [dis-arginine9]-bradricenin, apelin, neurotensin, adenorphine A, and gerlin.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 also regulates the membrane transit of the neutral transporter of the re-equilibrated amino acid SLC6A19, and has a role in Hartnup disease.
Angiotensin 2 is the major cell-entry enzyme for some coronaviruses, including human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
S1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind to the angiotensin-2 transducer enzyme enzyme domain on the cell surface, causing cell adhesion and transmission of the virus and enzyme to the intracellular particles.
This insertion process requires the synthesis of protein S by a transmembrane protease enzyme, the host serine2, which is still being inhibited in trials as a potential treatment. This leads some to speculate that lowering levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in cells may help to resist infection.

A systematic study and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a marked reduction in the risk of pneumonia of 34% compared to the reference group".
"The risk of pneumonia was reduced among patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, who were at higher risk for pneumonia, particularly those who had suffered a stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors led to a reduction in pneumonia deaths, although the results were less robust in comparison to the overall risk of pneumonia".
The enzyme converted to human angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for acute lung injury. It has been found to improve pulmonary blood distribution, as well as oxygen saturation, in pigs with acute polycystic fatty acid-induced narrowing of the airways.
The half-life of the angiotensin-2 transducer is approximately 10 hours, with action starting after 30 minutes, and the duration of action (time period) lasting up to 24 hours.
There is considerable evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 may be a promising treatment for those with intolerance to traditional angiotensin-resonant system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and in diseases accompanied by elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the blood. There are clinical trials under evaluation, on the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 injection in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The Ministry of Communications and Technology in collaboration with the Ministry of Health has taken over the design of the app.


Australia and New Zealand are both considering designing apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app, as well as the BlueTrees.and protocol, and Russia intends to launch an app that uses virtual geo-periphery for patients whose doctors have diagnosed COVID-19 from residents of Moscow, designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if the use of applications is limited to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that could add their own coronavirus-related apps to their app store; restricting this to "official" or other reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.

Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.

"Legal, necessary and proportionate" should be the monitoring;
The extension of monitoring and surveillance should include provisions on when to stop it;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 related purposes;
The security and confidentiality of the data should be protected and their protection should be demonstrated on the basis of evidence.
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing the degree of discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be specified in law;

PEP-BT was a coordinated effort that contained both centralized and decentralized approaches, rather than a single protocol. Decentralization-based protocols include privacy-preserving decentralized approach tracking (DP-PBT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, formerly known as call event numbers, CENs), privacy-sensitive protocols, and mobile intruder tracking (PECTs) mechanisms, among others.
In these protocols, personal identification never leaves the machine, and all matching takes place on the machine.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy technologies when collecting location data or cross-tracking and leveraging them to track the spread of COVID-19.

Chloroquine is a malaria medication that doctors also use to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine could be among four drugs under study as part of a clinical solidarity trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that New York state trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, strep throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Though most cases show mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.


When spray is scattered during the blowing process, it usually falls on the ground or on surfaces rather than being transmitted over long distances.

Virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The most infectious is in the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before symptoms and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the reaction of the retrograde transcriptase (RT-PCR) through a nasal swab.
It is recommended that masks be worn by those who are suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.




Symptoms of emergency are: difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking up, blue face or lips.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or strep throat may be observed.
I have seen gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea in varying proportions.
THE PRINCIPLE OF CHINESE SCIENTISM
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
It's called a daycare.
COVID-19 insemination period is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5%ofthe people who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports suggest that symptoms may not show up in all people who are infected.



Plugins and games may carry large proportions of the virus.
talk is more splashy than normal talk.


Some medical procedures such as tubal therapy and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as sprays, and then the virus spreads through the air.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although there is some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can generally infect two to three others. The virus remains stuck on surfaces for hours to days.

The lungs are the most affected organ with COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACCE2), which is most abundant in the type II lymphocytes found in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glucose protein called spike to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of the infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China had severe heart attacks, and they were more common in the more severe cases.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.

Covid-19 patients in the ICU had elevated blood clots (31%) and venous thrombosis (25%), which may be related to poor prognosis.Autopsies of individuals who died from COVID-19 found widespread dental damage (DAD), and inflammatory growths containing lymphocytes within the lungs.
Though SARS-CoV-2 targets ACE2-expressing epithelial cells in the respiratory system, severe COVID-19 patients are experiencing symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been shown that the pathogenic GMCSF-secreting T cells are associated with the introduction of the single cells that secrete the inflammatory interleukin 6 and inflammatory lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
I also reported a lymphatic spatter at autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the RRT-PCR polymerase chain reaction.
The test is usually performed using respiratory samples taken from a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or a swab may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
You can use blood tests, but it requires taking two blood samples two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.

Intensive care specialists and pulmonologists in the United States collect treatment recommendations from various bodies in a free resource, which is an online critical care book.

For symptoms, some specialists recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.

CDC recommends that health care professionals who are caring for people with COVID-19 be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIR) as well as using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions. CDC explains guidelines for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended items: personal protective equipment (PPE) braces, a respirator or face mask, eye condoms, medical glasses. It is best to use breathing aids (instead of face masks) if you have them.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of masks under an emergency use license (EUA).

Most COVID-19 cases are not so deteriorated as to require artificial respiration or alternatives, but some cases do.

It is not known whether either of these options are equally beneficial for people with a critical medical condition.


one study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed artificial respiration support, and 1.4% of cases died.
In China, about 30% of those who are taken to hospitals because of COVID-19 end up in intensive care units.

Pulmonary respirators should have high pressure control and positive hyperbaric pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pulmonary respiratory injury and chest relaxation.
The elevated positive end-zell pressure may not be available in the old respirators.

Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.

Antiviral medicines can be tried on people who have a serious illness.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted a temporary license for the use of regenerative plasma as an experimental treatment in situations where a person's life is seriously or directly threatened.

The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with over 42,000 people participating.
Estonia President, Ms Kirsty Kalliolaid, also issued a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel anxious because of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of getting infected themselves.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor: "The rising social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a giant storm that is hurting people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may take a mild course with mild symptoms or be asymptomatic, similar to other common upper respiratory illnesses such as the common cold.

According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, of which 5 days were in the hospital.
Though, the average time for those transferred to the ICU between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In an early case study, the average time from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and the total for cases was from 6 days to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Pathological tissue autopsies of postmortem lung samples show widespread dental damage with cellular fibroxide secretions in both lungs.
I found mutations in the viral cell neuropathy in the lymphocytes.
The lung picture shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest was seen in 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.


A low number of minor cases may lead to a higher estimate of mortality than the reality.

Hong Kong Hospital revealed a reduction in lung capacity of 20% to 30% in some recovering patients, and lung tests indicated that they were damaged.
It can also cause post-ICU syndrome after recovery.

Immunity is seen as possible, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported to have recovered from COVID-19 and subsequently re-infected.
It is believed that these cases are aggravated if the infection persists more than if it is repeated.
He thinks the virus is natural and has an animal origin, given the spread of infection.

A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that 1 December 2019 is the first date for the onset of symptoms.




Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate from injuries is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other metrics include CFR, which represents the percentage of those who are detected and die from a disease, and Infectious Mortality Rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of those who are infected (detected and undetected) and who die from a disease.

Though antibodies may not be produced by all infected individuals, their presence may provide information about how many people are infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castellone di Ada, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Janglt, the disease spread because of carnival festivals, and it spread to the youth, causing a relatively lower death rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been officially classified as being caused by it.
Plus, the German health system hasn't been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, maybe about 3% have antibodies, according to an evaluation I do on blood donors.
69 deaths have been confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and the death rate varies between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies done in China and Italy.
The risk is highest for men at 50, with the difference between men and women only fading at 90.

The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.

In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track gender-classified data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.

The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
The Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that Ku is an abbreviation for Corona, and WD for Virus, and W19 for Disease, refer to the year of the first detection of the outbreak: 31 December 2019.

They use earlier studies of SARS-CoV because it is similar to SARS-CoV-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Tre strategies are being studied.
First, researchers aim to develop a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the molecule vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain molecules of the virus.
In SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the protein SpikeS, which helps the virus invade the ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (RDNA vaccines, a new technology for vaccine creation).

It was recommended that further study be conducted on the effect of nitasoxaneide on organisms after its inhibition at low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated. Studies have shown that the initial preparation of the spike protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Osiltamir® does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm may be one of the complications of the late stages of acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-sitokin storm properties. The National Health Commission of China added tocilizumab to the treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
