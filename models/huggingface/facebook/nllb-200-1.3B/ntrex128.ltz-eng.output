Welsh MPs are worried about looking like idiots.
There are some MPs concerned by a proposal to change their title to Member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
MPs across the political spectrum are concerned about being ridiculed.
One Labour MP was concerned it would rhyme with Twp and PwP.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp means cocky.
A Plaid party MP said the group as a whole was "just happy" and suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was open to changing the name, but indicated that MWP and Muppet would not be far apart.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced the same as the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly's committee, which is currently drafting legislation to initiate the name change, said: "The final decision on the appointment of the deputies is, of course, with the deputies themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received widespread support.
The Commission favoured "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs", but the MWP option received more support in a public meeting on the question of the titles of MPs.
The MPs seem to be suggesting other options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may be a headache for the incumbent official, Elin Jones, who is expected to table the amendment bill within two weeks.
The reform legislation includes other changes, such as how the Assembly works, rules on disqualification of MPs and the draft committee system.
The Assembly has the last word on what to call it when it debates a law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was cast in a proposal to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly voted against its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change vote, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are as quiet as the church during the Harlem shooting
"In the old days, the elders said that there was a cafe and a church on every corner", said Lord Adam.
There is no more skin.
He said the disappearance of coffee shops was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
The cafeteria is no longer near the steps where people regularly go.
Likewise with the churches, he takes care that the proceeds from the sale of property do not delay as some of the elders imagine, and sooner or later they return to where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums and filled with people who don't help the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white", he said, "and they want to close these churches quickly because it's unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black capital of the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved in the 1930s.
A black community from nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major thoroughfare for commerce in Harlem, who refused to hire blacks.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson's community made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the bell tower.
The Rev. David Johnson, the grandson and successor of Father Johnson of St. Martin's, proudly called the bell play "the poor man's bell".
The expert who played the July bell called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the world's first bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was transferred to the larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been happening at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought in by lay leaders, others by the diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, with lay officials, wrote to the diocese in July, concerned that the diocese would try to pass on the expenses to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the work of the architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some pastors complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while diving in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California, which marks the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was on a Saturday morning for half an hour with friends on a dive when he heard the boy crying for help and was overcome with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought it was just a pleasure to catch a lobster, but then realized he was being bitten.
I've been knocked out!
His entire key leg was torn off, and he noticed the hammer as he approached the boy.
"I told everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" added the hammer.
The boy was rushed to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Sponge Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but this one was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles also said the victims suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's is climbing into the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's hosts boats, supermarkets and Debenhams, with coffeehouse-style beauty departments with specialist assistants.
As part of a major push into the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which is steadily growing as fashion and home goods return, these larger beauty departments will be in 11 stores across the country, and in further stores next year if successful.
Supermarkets are investing in beauty because they want to fill the shelves that were previously reserved for the tableware, microwaves and other household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would expand its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also be given more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to those in the boat shops.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup range, so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by young consumers.
Perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, with the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, opening later this year.
Shopping online and buying small quantities of everyday food in small shops means that supermarkets have to make more efforts to get people to come and shop.
Mike Coupe, the manager of Sainsbury's, said the outlets were looking more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tried to fight Aldi and Lidl's discount offerings with more services and non-food products.
Ainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos outlets and several Habitats stores since the supermarket bought both chains two years ago, boosting food sales and making acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to overhaul the cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boats, but the partnership was quickly broken up after a dispute over the sharing of revenues from the drugstores and supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Llodys is to play a role in the plan by launching an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, and four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained staff, who the client would be happy to ask for advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to each individual's needs.Through a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that puts the old fashioned way of shopping in the shade.
Peter Jones is rumored to be in for an £11 million deal with Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, has become a sensation after television presenter Holly Willoughby signed an £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on her Instagram account that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has ousted Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, at the last minute from her lucrative lifesyl brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "confused" when the TV star admitted during a tense meeting with a dentist at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant she had no time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The venture has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop and has doubled Willpughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones fled the UK and went to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It would weigh on their long-term future, which would accompany them through the next century.
When they heard this, all who heard were astonished.
No one could believe what had happened, for it had been so from the beginning.
There's a warehouse at the Marlow headquarters with goods ready for sale.
Experts say the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the company millions as it invests heavily in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and homewear, and there are now potential delays to the launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby took Truly to the helm in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as president in March.
The couple is going on a road trip together and the vacation and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information on Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
We talked and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for a comment that some would consider "just presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Said Trump in his "television host" voice.
I have not given up anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting, after the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
The negotiations on denuclearisation are not going ahead.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leading politicians during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North saw no "promising response" from the US to North Korea's earlier disarmament efforts.
Instead, the US would continue with sanctions to put more pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We have good relations with North Korea", he said.
We would have gone to war with North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: no more missile tests, aid for hostage rescue and the repatriation of American soldiers killed in combat by lethal remnants of missile tests, freeing hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to cram into this crowded arena, we'd only have 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been relocated, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"In many cases, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge", Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff can work on the site.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Management Administration, said Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could participate in the relief effort.
Regarding the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not prepared enough for the will of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not available anywhere on the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though there was a warning, may have cost many lives.
Travel between the various Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's decrepit infrastructure a major campaign theme and has donated money for roads and railways.
However, the government of Lord Joko was also plagued by a lack of funding, where he resumed the following year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from partisan tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority represent a more conservative form of belief.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought with knives, bayonets and other brutal weapons in the streets.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool compares the game to a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with a goal in the 89th minute of a Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London against a defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal and his team were 1-0 down.
He took the ball with his left foot and shot it towards the goal.
The trial ran high over the box, towards the right corner of the net.
The ball flew over a jumping arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"It was just about getting in that position, getting the ball and players like Shaq always playing as much forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the edge coming and touched it suddenly, and without thinking about it and just shot.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead after the break, thanks to a 25th-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before being sprinted towards Liverpool's half.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in midfield.
He then threw a beautiful ball that sent Hazard into the box.
Hazard runs past the defense and ends up in the long pocket with a left-footed shot to Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
According to the agency's spokesman, Mr. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had been destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude quake, which caused the wave to rise up to 20 feet.
The city of Palu, with its population of over 380,000, was covered with dust from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 am on Monday at Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
People in the area who see or hear anything should report it to the police.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagen said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, so anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the John Street area of Birkenhead should contact us.
I also urge anyone else, especially taxi drivers who have caught anything on Dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be important to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a house.
That afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene to inquire about where she had been found.
Police said the investigation is continuing and they are informing other family members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just about to return to his apartment, but police explained to him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building at this time.
He was speechless as he understood what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it may take hours before they can return home.
One heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene at the moment.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
It keeps repeating itself. It's so terrible.
At 14:00 two police trucks were inside the barricade and another one outside the barricade.
A few policemen stood inside the fence and watched the residential quarters.
Anyone with information should join @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 Protocol 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament is the new memorial to be included in the "Rewrite History" series.
His banishment would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England by the fanatical and puritanical supporters of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society describes Mr Crick's suggestion as "nonsense" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldmsith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the debate over the replacement of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would be the target.
The symbol of the English Civil Wars was never ordered by Cromwell and never executed.
Perhaps the false Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is the proof of 19th-century opinion and is part of the historical record of a figure, of whom many still consider him worthy of being celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, first in the late 19th century and now, as the defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a very accurate representation is still a matter of debate.
What is certain is that conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a distinctly recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Farmer slaughtering pigs
According to local media, a pig farmer was attacked and killed at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery near a stable in a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines in a pig pen on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he had entered the market with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next month, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby pigsty.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on his sweat.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig bit the farmer to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", the cousin with the surname Wu said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage shows Yuan going to the market to feed the pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not a pig of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was detained to prevent it from attacking other people while police gather evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family is likely negotiating with market authorities over compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their yard in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
In 2006, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife could drive the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just playful.
They're just pimping, they're very curious... they don't want to lose you.
You just have to show enough respect, he said.
Heavy rains in the southwest United States due to Hurricane Rosa
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves across the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa has been a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph since 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, Mexico.
A sunset in the north is expected.
Meanwhile, a channel is forming over the Pacific Ocean, and is moving towards the west coast of the United States, and the Rosa may be moving closer to the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture from the north and southwest U.S.
Rosa will bring a mean of up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching channel, will form widely distributed heavy locks in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally 1 to 4 Inch Reefs cause dangerous flooding, mudflows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes flooding of 2 to 3 inches per hour in several places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible, with weather conditions getting worse due to the destructive nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be extremely dangerous to walk into the desert at the risk of tropical storms.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to quickly turn into rivers and thunderstorms will bring local harsh air and dust.
The nearby channel will bring thick local reefs to parts of the southern California coast.
Locks of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small mudflows and smooth roads.
This was the first rain in the region of the travel season.
Some distributed tropical rainforests begin to move closer to Arizona, in late summer and early fall, before spreading further, in late spring and fall.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations across the US as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Heiansdo this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a probe in the middle of the United States.
There is almost a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build and expand.
In many central and eastern U.S. states, a warm start to October is expected with temperatures reaching 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast gives high odds for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
Over 20 million people watched on six television stations Thursday the poignant Supreme Court testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political turmoil rages, and broadcasters have interrupted regular broadcasts for the last-minute twist of a Friday: an agreement that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has made with the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was totally into her and tried to take her out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he was 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, over 20.4 million people watched the trial on Friday.
The company calculated average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers from other networks that broadcast the trial, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen often has some difficulty counting people looking in offices.
To illustrate: The audience is the same as that of a playoff football game or the Oscars surprise.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts supported Kavanaugh's appointment, ran all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Interest remains high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was booed by protesters as he tried to get a lift for a trial in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down as he was shot and was live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
Will he judge the earth with truth?
He was told, "You have power, but so many women have no power".
Flake informed that his office had made a statement and, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks later broadcast live for hours as the Judiciary Committee voted to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which the Democratic minority wanted.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and some senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the choice to vote for Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the UK's future and undermining the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, alongside her cover story, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson underlined her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should raise their taxes together would be "totally ridiculous".
Police have arrested suspect Dytheon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder and taken to the jail, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail has been set at $350,000, the attorney reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department honors the Louisiana State Police, State Poice Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanks the local police for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-3-inch (2.01 m) center grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday, the LSU basketball coach said his team was devastated and in shock after Wayde's death.
"That's what you always worry about", Wade said.
Volcanoes spew ash over Mexico City
Spent ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after it became active in the crater, recording 183 gas and ash emissions in the last 24 hours.
The center recorded some thunder and tremors.
Images on social networks show thin layers of ash on cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed a zoom in volcanic activity that has been occurring 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists were held back at Oprou against police with eggs and powder colour, which created dark clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Clashes also broke out later in the day and police took out their buttons to control the fighting.
Within hours pro-independence groups were calling for "no forgiveness" against unionists who had long called for "live Spain".
Fourteen people were medically treated for injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence region one year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose a majority to become independent, although the result was small against secession by the boycott of the election.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the election and the polling stations through the region of violent conflict.
Pro-independence groups camped outside overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration went on, but we had to find another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, says he has no hope for the prospect of an independent Catalonia.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose to go, but now I'm stuck", he said.
Despite a decisive, if narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to stay strong this year, with most of the most prominent leaders in exile or in prison awaiting their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests by phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It will be more and more", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will contest next year's European elections.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
London: Men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly ran into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there's damage to the gates and the building itself.
It's also possible that at some point the car was shot with an armrests.
Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers by Menga's goal.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the win.
Livingston's promotion rocked the Rangers for Steven Gerrard's only second victory in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference as Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remain without a win in the Premiership this season and play against the Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
Previously, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their run in the division to six players, with coach Holt still enjoying the win since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is losing the odds against open visitors.
Holt's team should have been able to get the nose for him long before the hit because his directness caused the Rangers problems.
Scott Robinson was penetrative but made his effort to the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only score his effort before he met Craig Halkett before the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble with the visitors.
And so the gold fell.
The Rangers got a free kick in Livingston's stand, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play the Menga, who suddenly touched and hit from the center of the box.
At the time, the Rangers were dominating the property but found the home defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allen McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide by another play from Livingston.
Cruisers always came to the brake in Livingston's box and were always thrown around, while two eleven-meters were required - after the helmet challenged substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball was knocked out.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To one man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this high road.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but great credit must go to Holt for the way he has refreshed the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett led a formidable, highly organized defense, while the Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall through on their toes.
But the Rangers had a lot of inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they fell short of those standards.
The last pass was only needed when they opened the home side and it's like a wake-up call for the Rangers who were in the midfield.
Erdogan is receiving a different reception in Cologne.
There was laughter and blue skies on Saturday as the leaders of Turkey and Germany sat down to drink coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany  which was planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, press freedom in Turkey and its accession to the EU.
Erdogan is on his way to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have taken security measures to block a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters have appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both protests reflect the divisions of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and a monarch by others.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist dies in collision with a car.
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred not far from the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southwest of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the rescuers helped, but the man died on the spot.
The crash happened months after a cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
City police said officers were on the way to identify the man and inform the family.
Road closures and bus shelters are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six suspects were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the prison official said.
Disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialist Tornado officers were called in to handle the disturbance, which involved eight prisoners in a wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said specially trained prison personnel were deployed to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for blisters.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible for police have been dismissed and could spend longer behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, offensive officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disorder in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It's rare to see a tropical depression in Arizona, but that's what is likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa pulls its final energy through the southwest desert, bringing flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already forecast flooding for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route over Phoenix to the dunes and come closer later in the month with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have reached tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 zentimeters of rain, with isolated numbers as high as 6 zentimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin may gain 1 to 2 centimeters, with isolated summits up to 4 centimeters.
For those without flood risk, the rain of the rose is a blessing because the region is affected by a drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some rain is likely to be good because of the current dry conditions in the southwest.
The United States is experiencing at least an extreme drought, the second-highest category, after just over 40 percent of Arizona", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa makes its way overland across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still in hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is moving to cooler waters in the Pacific and is losing strength.
So, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico with a tropical storm strengthening on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico could be severe, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Three to six centimeters of rainfall is expected in Baja California and northwest Sonora, with up to 10 centimeters of rainfall possible", weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, where it will then move up through Arizona and southern Utah late Thursday night.
The main threat from Rosa or its remnants is expected to be severe precipitation in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern United States desert, according to the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce life-threatening floods and mudslides in the desert, and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton robbery four suspected murderers arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the vicinity of Excelsior Terraces in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a man in his 20s were arrested in the area of Radstock overnight, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police have called for witnesses to come forward who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh is suffering from the public and the anger of the Democratic Party.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the reckless and abusive tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a ballot party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered through the entire election process from the Democratic Party's recklessness and meddling.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress on Thursday vehemently and emotionally denouncing Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual abuse of her as a teenager.
Ford also swore that this statement was true.
The president said Saturday that the American people have seen the brilliance and the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh.
A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as a vote for one of the greatest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a proven record of public service.
The president immediately pointed to Kavanaugh's nomination during his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I do not run as a man running, but I run with the spirit.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for big candidates".
Trump argued that he was on a mission to "be strong and slow".
The first decisive Senate-level election for Kavanaugh's nomination is set to take place on Friday, a senior Matt staff member told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people have died, many flooded as huge waves hit the coast, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people attended a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when 20-foot waves hit the coast in the midnight hours, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"As the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, people were still on the beach doing their activities and did not leave immediately", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it was full of cars, huts, and boats, it tore everything to shore", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had a speed of 800 km/h at sea before it hit the coast.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
Surveys made public by the disaster management show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn apart and collapsed and a mosque completely surrounded by water.
The Samaritans were still in the coastal city.
Earthquakes have saved a region of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology said in a statement that the energy released in the Friday earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city at the end of a long-drawn bay may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Bodies were found under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the injuries and damage could be extensive along the 300km coastline north of Palu, in an area called Doggola, near the epicenter.
"Communications are completely broken and we have no information from Donggola", Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get worse", he said.
The agency was also heavily criticized for not saying that the tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the tsunami came at the same time as the warning.
Amateur images on social media show a man on a higher stack calling out to the street below to warn of a tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, destroying buildings and cars.
Reuters was only able to immediately confirm the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive power outages and communication disruptions around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has initially sent transport planes with aid supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still urgently need food and other essentials.
The local airport has just been opened for rescue teams and will remain open until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision personnel from Donggola arrived safely in Palu City, where the employees were camped out on the premises of their office, they must have witnessed scenes of destruction en route, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's very bad.
As aid teams began to realize the extent of the destruction, some complained that experienced foreign aid teams were not allowed to land on Palu.
According to Indonesian law, equipment and personnel are only allowed into the country if the affected area has been declared a national disaster area.
But that's not the end of the story.
"It is still a regional disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
So the government says, "OK, it's a national disaster, we can open up for international aid but it hasn't happened yet".
As the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family hope that the missing are among those miracles that will always return after such disasters.
Samden was saved from a canal as a small child.
A sinner rescuers have rescued a woman who was buried under a pile of debris, right next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders who were shot for the Asian Games,
Others from the Roa Roa Hotel were former students, Mr Mandagi said.
"As an old dog in the paragliding, I carried my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after the rumor of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse, the paragliding team sent WhatsApp messages to the team participating in the beach festival.
Unfortunately, the seven stories were drawn with only one hook, and only two with blue hooks.
"I think the day is coming when the news will be delivered", he said.
Robbers stole $26,750 while filling a vending machine in Newport/Levee.
The robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's security guard who was trying to fill an ATM on Friday, according to a letter from Newport police.
The driver was about to empty the ATM at a recreation complex and was about to deposit the money, police officer Dennis McCarthy wrote.
"But while he was preparing, another servant came up behind him and snatched away the money from the man's account.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, but police were unable to determine how many.
Anyone with identity information should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing on Twitter, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known as Ye for a while and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes along with her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of her new album is expected.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande who cannot appear on the show due to emotional issues, said the show's founder.
Although it is an abbreviation of his professional name, West had previously said that the word also had a religious meaning to him.
"I believe ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is du", West said earlier this year, during a presentation of his new album on Radio Big Boy.
So am I, I am the sea, be the sea.
It comes from Kanye, which means the one, to just you - under the mirror of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a mirror of who we are.
He's one of many famous rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs used to be called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he decided to go with Love and Brother Love.
A former Western singer, Jay-Z, also played with both lowercase and uppercase letters.
D'AMLO and Mexico have vowed to use the military only against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed under oath that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
During a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on the people and killed 300 at a time when the left-wing movement was sweeping through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has announced that he will support young Mexicans through monthly student subsidies and by opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational facilities foster criminal gangs.
The US would double the funding of the I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in artificial intelligence research, says AI investor and friend Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after increasingly hearing from US government circles that the US does not have a proper strategy in the research on the DKI.
China has set a target for AI research by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget is a good start, considering that all other nations are so far behind the US, and we are working on the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next leap being measured in the US, Lee told CNN in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order came out this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI firms, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello game, later he was CEO of Microsoft Research and President of Google China.
Lee knew of previous technology competitions in the US such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when they would be next to help find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government aid, Lee said.
"It's not just China that has the academic top-level; it's the societies", says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been engaging students in the recent years of universities to work on AI.
Lee said under the improved immigration law, the U.S. could also stop DKI research.
"I think the green card should be offered automatically to AI professors", he said.
The Chinese State Council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to do for US researchers, but the quality of academic work is not as good as in China, according to the LEE.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint AI center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 trillion investment in an initiative they call AI Next.
As for the NSF, which is currently investing over 100 million dollars in AI.
The US government has been working on a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing its name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step to defuse a long-running dispute with Greece that prevents it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring country is an attempt to designate the province and has vetoed its bid to join NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal for the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gyorge Ivanov had said he would only vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign had shown that it would be difficult to achieve the required 50 percent vote to hold the election.
The pre-referendum text reads: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name Wiessel, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying for admission to organizations like the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of Macedonia so that young people can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although legally, several MPs have said they would respect the outcome of the vote.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for the name change.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported in the elections until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to the 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.
"I'm choosing to come to my children, our place as in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a wheelchair user in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko were announced in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, quietly set up a stage in front of the tents of those boycotting the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in head-on, not through the hand-door to Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we are proud.
If they want us to be just Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring us significant investments in Macedonia, which has a carbon price of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority because more than 80 percent of the population is for NATO and the EU", Zaev said as he left the polling booth.
He said that the result would be a confirmation for our future.
A poll last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than required.
Another poll, by the Macedonian television station Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said yes.
For the referendum to be valid, 50 percent plus one must vote.
The election would be the first major setback in the pro-Western government's campaign since May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero breaks through all of Brighton's defenses and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling break through Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored with ease in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in midfield at the start of the race.
He ran as a tease three defenders from Brighton and hit it under the open field.
Aguero then faced four opponents.
He had pushed a defender away who had played in the other half.
Then they seated him on the left side of the table.
The Englishman pushed forward with the first touch of the ball on the field and had to return it to Aguero, who had put the ball in the right corner with his right foot to the Brighton goalkeeper.
"The Aquero are having some problems with their feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We had to let him play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are happy that he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aquero got the ball far in Brighton's half.
He made a wonderful pass over the left flank to Leroy Sane.
The Sane had dribbled a bit before he had given Sterling a long pass.
The Sky Blues had just kicked the ball into the net before it went out.
City will play Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
The joke about the game against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, as a reason to force a fresh start.
But the always-challenging joker hopes to prevail against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs which is one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies are looking to a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still struggling to secure their first division title.
Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can make a big game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I'll experience this year.
Why should I not accept it?
The Nationals have yet to announce how they'll start Sunday, but are certainly well advised to pitch the jokers in that situation.
The striker, who will be making his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and will play on his rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump on the ballot in West Virginia
The president was highlighting the situation surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the upper house while pointing to the importance of a Republican victory in this midterm election.
Everything we thought was at stake in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones. I'm not just running, I'm running, so I'm really fighting for good candidates", he said.
Trump continues, "You see these powerful, powerful radical groups of Democrats, you see what's happening now.
And those who are determined to take power under all circumstances, you see the senselessness, the community.
Whoever they hurt, whoever they have to overcome to get power and control, when they want to, we don't give them power and control.
Democrats, he says, are on a mission of resistance and blocking.
"And you'll see in the next four days", he said, calling Democrats "the rogues and the sinners and the filthy and the lost".
He mentions the Senate Judiciary Committee with the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was heavily exploited.
Do you remember the answer to this?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, I was -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Work is no longer given by God.
It's as intolerant of those who they think they are.
When momentum activists in my polling station voted against me, I was a little surprised.
Finally, I'm the last person from a working party who was told we're not welcome -- just because we say what we think.
My party colleague Joan Ryan is being treated similarly because she is strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censors for not being right about Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt is looking at the importance of responsible engagement in the economy, national security, and Europe, ironically similar to the situations Jeremy has criticized in senior leadership.
The note for Nottingham East workers meeting on Friday says that we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local worker representative, Friday night meetings were exactly what they were.
Today, unfortunately, as in the past, the noise of many meetings and the promises of friendly, friendly politics are forgotten more than ever, if ever.
It is increasingly striking that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged as acceptable to the party leadership.
This was shortly after Jeremy took over, as colleagues with whom I had previously worked had expected from similar political views that I would once again take a turn and take a position that I would never have taken otherwise - in national security as well as in the EU internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it's not really important what I say - I get a barrage of comments on social media against the politics of the centre, saying I only have my place in the Labour Party.
And that's just my experience.
However, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues because the comments I get are political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and hardly look the other way.
One of the saddest aspects of these political times is that the level of abuse is becoming increasingly normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week demanded that the Labour Party adopt a culture of tolerance.
The truth is, we are no longer from God, and with every "no-confidence" movement or change of election the party gets smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last couple of years, to stay calm, not be too hard, and then I'm done.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by a neglect by the Thatcher government during which my classroom almost collapsed, I have tried to improve public services for those who need them most - whether as a local politician or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could question my political position and the points on which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who are in favour of Friday's movement, all I want to say is that if the country is facing a Brexit, which is damaging to housing, commerce and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But the only message I have for the Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that no threat or political statement will stop me from doing what I believe is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38  17 Melrose Ayr untied to the top
Two attempts in the last few minutes have scored the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They're now at the top, the only one out of ten.
In the end, it was a better defense, just like the better seizure of opportunities, that the home team and coach Peter Murchie could be proud of.
"We have been challenged in our matches so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Good for Ayr, they took the chance better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, assisted by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr closer, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, which he received in a game against the Warriors, weakened Melrose and Jason Baggot was able to start an unchanged attempt.
Climo managed to convert a penalty kick for Ayr, just before half-time, he then converted a try alone to score 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's run, driven by Baggot, was able to reduce the gap to five points.
After an interruption due to an injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was knocked out, in a re-start, Ayr was able to restart through a run by Stafford McDowall, replaced by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to take advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, after heavy pressure.
The home team came back, as usual, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for hitting Climo without a ball on the penalty line, Macpherson was able to score a touchdown in the back of the attacking Ayr.
Climo was able to convert as he did from the start, after Kyle Rowe managed to catch David Armstrong's kick and beat winger Gregor Henry to a fifth-run lead.
Still star player looking for a new career in the hotel industry
Star player Ford Kieran is looking to switch to hotel business after it emerged he was nominated as the CEO of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis stars in the popular BBC show, which he writes and in which he co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next nine episodes would be the show's last, and Kiernan plans to do something new after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is a director at Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan was about to enter Glasgow's booming restaurant industry.
The sea is ours: Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol under a tactical position at the La Paz headquarters.
Public buildings raised an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases run from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon under the motto: "The sea is rightfully ours".
It is our duty to take it back.
Across the land surrounding Bolivia, the memory of a 19th-century conflict on Chile's lost coast is still alive, with the desire to sail out again to the Pacific Ocean.
Right now, hope is greater than ever, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the spirit, the spirit of solidarity and solidarity and hopes of course for a positive decision", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens in the hope that The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia and, after decades of sporadic talks, force Chile to negotiate with Bolivia over sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia - who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year - is putting much emphasis on talks on Monday.
"We are about to rejoin the Pacific", he said in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not rule in favor of Bolivia and that it would not change much if it did.
DUN, which is based in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction over Chile and has announced that it will not interfere in any talks.
The fact that the court's decision was announced six months after the final negotiations shows that the case was "just complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of bringing in the Bolivian oil, they've been shredding it for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
Morales's militant rhetoric has weakened all Chilean will, he said.
Bolivia and Chile continue to talk at some point, but it is extremely difficult to start talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, as Bolivian representative in The Hague, confirmed that the court's decision was made particularly quickly.
"Monday offers Bolivia an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end a 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also pointed out that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime exit as a political springboard.
"Bolivia will never stop claiming its right of access to the Pacific", he said.
Judgment is an opportunity to try to put the past behind us.
North Korea says no nuclear buildup until it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the US to keep the promises made by the rival presidents at the Singapore summit.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attempted to revive suspended nuclear talks by diplomacy more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream" that further sanctions and the US's response to a declaration to end the Korean War would force Korea to ever kneel.
Washington is cautious about approving the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards massive disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about arming an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows show a massive upsurge in head coverings on the streets.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block out the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveil a bunch of oversized headwear for their SS19 collection at the Catwalk, which will shade the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Absolutely impractical, Instagram flooded this summer and these designers sent their eye-catching creations onto the catwalk.
The highlight of Valentino was an oversized beige hat with something resembling a feather floating over the model's head.
Other oversized accessories include ornate watermelons, a mixture of cotton and pineapple  but they are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne has also released some weird masks just right for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have lipstick and are more like Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creature resembles a diving suit complete with snorkels and glasses, while another looks like a molten glass cone.
And if you want to see more, you will not be disappointed.
Observers predict that the giant cats could find their way to the street near you.
The oversized one is the feast of La Bomba, the 60 cm wide board-shaped straw hat seen by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the wildly impractical hit that has flooded social media is sending another big creation onto the catwalk - a beach basket the size of the model who is posing it.
The deep orange bassinet, with bassinet fringes and a white leather grip, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La-Riviera-SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Weeks.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see a lot of heat and beach cravings on our streets next summer. Because designers have achieved such a big impact, it's hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools hold the record for academic achievement and this continued in 2018 with new outstanding exam results, which could only be reinforced through individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other societal endeavours.
With over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to achieve the highest level of service for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an institution with a coordinated and discussed curriculum, we see modern languages as popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to a person in a language they understand, it goes into their head.
When you speak to him in your own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since these tests, we can see that languages are at the top, with the best results within the independent schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages scored A+.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students achieved A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective subject are now considered the same as the main subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also in a different way.
A 2014 survey by the English Commission for Vocations and Skills found that employers report that it is difficult to fill vacancies, 17 per cent due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future tasks.
With more future job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are becoming increasingly important in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, learning a second language gives you a real head start in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in England, 75 percent are unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French as the sole language falling behind the two-language range by 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to invest in language learning for today's children.
Multilingualism, especially in growing economies, offers children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school teaches another language.
A handful of schools are focusing on the more classical modern languages, while others are learning languages that may be more important to England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are always a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may hold.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are vital to the future of the country and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools provide this choice, diversity and outstanding performance for the young people of Scotland.
It's got to be fair.
John Edward is a director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It is only a matter of determining how many minutes he will play.
"It's more like one and less than 48, " Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As usual, James was asked earlier this week what his plans are for the Lakers' six-player preseason schedule.
"I don't need a pre-season player at this point in my career to be ready", he said.
Trump's election tour in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins the evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, with a hell of a lot of whale watching campaigns.
It's Trump's first of five tours next week, with stops in places as friendly to him as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote in the run-up to his election to the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming for support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's election rally for West Virginia is scheduled for tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19 pm ET.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump would mention this week's nomination for life in prison of Brett Kavanaugh, whose election was suspended for a week over allegations of sexual abuse with a former senator while the FBI investigates the case.
But the first goal is to help the Republicans stay the course in the November elections and get a new momentum.
President Trump's campaign has said the five events next week are aimed at re-energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible during the height of the campaign", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The election event, scheduled for the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, will bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania in the evening and will be covered by the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won in 2016 by more than 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to help him get a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 Team USA shows courage in the fight to keep the hopes of the singles match alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four-on-one Saturday afternoon may be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging pendulum is a very invented sporting concept, but one that the players believe in, and never more so than in competitions like this.
Where would they say the swelling is exactly?
"They had a six-point lead and now there are four more, so we see this as a small swing", said Jordan Spieth, as he closed for today.
Europe has the advantage of four points, of course, with two more to play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel a little wind in their sails and they have a lot to be proud of, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together every day, and both of them are going for three out of four points.
The spieth was deadly from the tee to the green and is an example.
The happy keel rock grew harder as his lap progressed, sinking a large pit to tear the match to itself and with Thomas two by two behind him.
His pitch, by which they won the game at 15, was left with a similar cry, the kind that makes a Sooner believe that the American team is not out.
"You just have to dig deep enough and take care of your own game", said Spieth.
That's all that's left for all these players now.
18 holes to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old but beloved couple are four out of four and can't go wrong anymore.
The only couple who did not shoot a bogey on a Saturday afternoon was Mollywood, but they avoided the Saturday mornings, Friday mornings and the nine returning a Friday mornings bogey as well.
On this run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the spectators, it cements that they are the players who deserve to be beaten on a Sunday, and there will be no more popular player to see a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
The two prefer to be in different holes at the same time.
The European Union is not yet ready to accept the European Union's position.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the early days of fourball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they will not emerge so soon.
Sunday there is no one to help you out of your laughter.
Fourballs and four-player games are fascinating because of the interactions between the links; the right that they give; the right that they don't give and the way in which a strategy and insight can change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is leading well for the final day, but this four-match session also showed that Team USA has the will to fight what was doubted, especially the Stateside.
Europe go 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final day
Europe has a healthy lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a fourth-ball of a sampling in the fourth match against the USA with a score of 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two wins over a shaky Tiger Woods to extend their lead to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, who lost the trophy two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated a poorly-started American side in the quarter-finals, sitting down the series at 3-1.
The U.S. offers more resistance in the fourth, wins two games, but they don't get the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 individual matches to secure the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while at the Molinari, together with Mollywood after a sensational weekend becoming only the second pair to score four points since the first four matches in Ryders Cup history.
Against Woods and Patrick Reed won in the four-ball they harmonize well against an empty Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau at a sympathetic 5&4.
Woods, who had trained himself through two matches at Samsen, sometimes showed brilliant breakouts in the fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had a break in the early morning fours, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the fours and joined 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third ranked in the world.
Europe is not just a beautiful, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points behind Samsung.
They recorded a gracious 2&1 victory over the spinners Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and later came back to win against Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a more point deficit in singles, although Furyk's side only needed to maintain the trophy.
After they had been second-hand for two days, as usual, a counterattack on Sunday seemed unintended by them.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen mistrust against the United States and there was no way North Korea would unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly that North Korea has shown many "good will" in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and not expanding nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we are not seeing a similar response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the US there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri echoes the well-known complaint about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization in which North Korea is rewarded for each step, he stresses his statement in which he does not explicitly dismiss unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri refers to a joint letter by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States suggested Pyongyang surrender its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls for international sanctions relief against North Korea.
"The US insists on denuclearization first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to enforce itself in a coercive manner, and is challenging the declaration of the end of war", Ri said.
The perception that sanctions could bring us to our knees is a dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was first announced by a US leader earlier this week at the United Nations.
The minister, however, called three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and said: "If the party for denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a straitjacket".
Just like that, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from that of last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of the US mainland by North Korean missiles was triggered by "Mr. Devil" President Trump when he called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking the first steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Monday: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue to be firm and thoroughly disrupted until we achieve complete, final and proven denuclearization".
The Security Council has been stepping up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, hoping to stop Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs by withdrawing funds.
Pompeo met Ri behind the scenes at the UN General Assembly and then said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang and said progress had been made, but within hours denounced North Korea for its "gangster demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. takes countermeasures.
He said Kim would take "responsive measures", seeking security guarantees that Trump had secured in Singapore and a rapprochement to normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students choose courts to rest.
A new class at Harvard University is asking all of its students to get more sleep in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of putting caffeine in your blood at night.
One academic found that college students, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the court, which is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the court after a four-year study was given on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And it came to pass at the end of the month, that one came to me, and said to me, Why am I not now in the year of my birth?
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and business leader of the university's health services, said the university decided to host the course after noticing that students were experiencing a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course offers a range of interactive tasks.
One part shows a picture of a dormitory where students can click on coffee tables, rides, sportswear and books and then learn about the effects of caffeine and lute, but also how sports performance affects sleep and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another study, participants learned that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A short section of the university campus, with interactive icons, then encourages students to reflect on their daily routine.
We don't know if it's worth changing students' behavior right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as one has a right to know about the health problems caused by smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of boasting about studying all night long still exists, according to the professors, and modern technology and the pressure on students, which is increasing, has as a consequence a lack of sleep and is a growing problem.
He said that ensuring adequate quality sleep should be a kind of secret weapon against stress, overwork and anxiety, even to prevent one from contributing to the fact that lack of sleep makes one hungry and one feels hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, even after he had chosen one of his courses in his junior year at Harvard.
He said that the court had eaten his teeth and inspired him to sue the entire university.
He hopes, in a next step, to get all doctoral students to complete a similar programme of study before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for when to go to bed, but also for getting up, and to beware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can throw off the rhythm throughout the day and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1  0 Rangers: Goal from Menga to Gerrard's team
Rangers suffered another defeat by Dolly Menga's goal, which degraded Steven Gerrard's little-connected side to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox were looking to secure their first match since their 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side brought Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving him eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers' line-up lacked inspiration and could not keep up.
While the Rangers now slide to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hiberian by the difference in goals.
And there could be further problems for the Rangers after Abbot Calum Spence was treated for a head injury, apparently caused by an object fired at the end of the game.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances, which allowed him to leave Ayr behind and reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11 that cost Hearts a point last week and would have been delighted to see his well-drilled team beat their opponents every time.
The Rangers had the ball more often, but Livingston had the ball more often.
They could have scored a goal two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass brought Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder overshot his big chance.
A deep free kick from Keaghon Jacobs to captain Craig Halkett gave Alan Lithglow the only opportunity on defense to shoot from a distance at the posts.
The Rangers were able to take control, but it looked more like hope than faith and their play in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had a foot injury after a quarter of an hour of running against Steven Lawless, but Abiter Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
Rangers only scored twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's cap shot and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be considered a run-in to the game, no one can argue that they didn't deserve it for their effort alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to agree to a standard Jacob's situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball between Scott Robinson, who kept a cool head and selected the Menga for a simple goal.
Gerrard reacted at halftime and traded the Coulibaly against Ryan Kent, which practically had a direct impact as the outfielder overtook Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came running from the sidelines to block.
But Livingston continued to provide visitors with exactly the genre of play they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett taking one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have taken advantage of the advantage in the loose moments, but McGregor held Jacobs to the bass before Lithgow shot a corner from a distance.
The Rangers traded Glenn Middleton a further later on to the right of an eleventh as he went up against Jacobs, but Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac The inventor of the violin counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago to the day, and still further on, the late physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, since a mainstay of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, 1950 saw the release of the film Bells of Colorado with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who portrayed more cowboys than scientists:
Man: What is it?
Rogers:  This is a hazard meter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you blow on the headphones, you can hear the sounds that come from the atoms through radioactivity in the minerals.
So, it's going to be a sure thing.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, which is named after him, lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to detect malignant cells
New cancer vaccines may teach the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells
Vaccination helps the immune system to detect malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and then transforming them in the lab
They can then identify a protein that's in many cancer cells and then inject it back.
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
In one woman treated with the vaccine, which helps the immune system to detect malignant cells, the cancer of the testicles disappeared after more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, then modifying them in the laboratory so that they recognize a protein from many cancers, called HER2, and then injecting the cells back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, as explained by Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "attacking" them, like attacking cancer cells, has already worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump tirade, with a MAGA cap, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a wide-ranging performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, he wore a cap that read Make America Great, lashed out at the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people and they say, 'How can you love Trump, where is a racist?'
So, if I was concerned about racism, I would have been kicked out of America long ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star pokes fun at Brett Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's tirade was uploaded via social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether the Rock tried to make fun of the West with the posts.
West also complained to the audience that he was having backstage problems with his head.
They were bullying me backstage.
"Don't let him go out like this, " they answered.
They were bullying me!
And then they said I was crazy, just like the Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see the empty space?" followed by a statement that he would wear his Superman costume, so no one could tell me what I was capable of.
Try love.
His comments were met with at least two bows from the audience and the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, as Variety writes, and one person told the publication: "The whole studio was completely quiet".
West replaced singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, as his colleague, rapper Mac Miller, had died two days earlier.
West has irritated others with his performance of I love it, as if a Perrier's bottle had been touched.
West was backed by the conservative TPUSA group's deputy leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the brave leaders: THANK YOU TO HELP THE MOB".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is just "who's gone and that's absolutely wonderful".
If I choose to DOGEINT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or their art) who I suspect is spreading a harmful ideology that could harm my community.
He's free.
But we are, too", she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "the artist formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first to change his name and thus follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course the later music legend Prince, who changed his name to an icon and called himself the artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder of a Belfast restaurant knife-wielding
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused will appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks male-dominated violence
Kit Harington is best known for his heavy-hit role as Jon Snow in HBO's brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that on-screen roles like this often make young men feel they have to mimic the strong man to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was concerned that something had gone wrong and wondered how to address the problem of male-dominated masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits to being "very stubborn" about the subject.
"I feel personally, quite strong, at the moment when they ship us with masculinity", said Hen.
What did we teach men when they were growing up, given the problems we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly to blame for the rise of male-dominated masculinity, through its extremely masculine characters.
And he said, What is the birth, and what is the teaching?
What is taught on television, and on the streets, that young men need to be a certain side of a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Want there is definitely something wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he does not want to do a four-part story of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he has had enough of "battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit is set to appear in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor once said that the knowledge of his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so in that sense she gave me my future family, and my life from now on", he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Yggdrasil, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the request of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS has reached a 14% increase.
Health experts say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
The 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a difference.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV along the way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the diseases transmitted come from inadequate protection in relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that mates leaked data on GOP senators, speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denied Saturday rumors that a member of her staff had posted personal information on three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers on her Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the allegations were hailed by "extreme right" figures on websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the information released were apparently private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online Thursday, uploaded by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the contributions had a link to the Water Office, and they released information about a member of the Water staff, lawmakers told The Hill.
"These baseless claims are completely false and an absolute lie", says D'Waters.
The member of my staff  whose identity, personal information, and security are in danger as a result of the dishonest and false claims  had absolutely nothing to do with the leaking of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters's comments quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is rage", wrote the flesh.
It suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If anyone is accused of doing something he did not do, he should not be angry.
One must not defy it.
No one should question the defendant's reasoning.
One must remain calm and balanced.
Fleischer came forward to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry during the hearing for harassing the Dons.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who opposes water in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In its statement, Water said that its office had informed the appropriate authorities and those responsible for law enforcement of these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the culprits come to light", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for actions that are destructive and dangerous for everyone and all members of my office".
Johnny English Strikes Again review  slightly intoxicating Rowan Atkinson parody
It has become a tradition to seek out Brexit-related performances in all new British films, which is not appropriate in the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy-parody franchise, which began in 2003 and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this ironic self-satire, which clearly portrays us as stupid, worth this nation's export opportunity?
Anyway, the blind-eyed and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his patent for screwing up a second time  his name says it all, that he is a broad comedy creation intended for non-English speaking cinema goers in other territories.
He is of course a stupid secret agent who, although he has a strange voice for idiot-glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a Mr Bean accent and a beak of the type that added a single note to the Chariots of Fire star at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also based on the traveller and international Man of Mystery, who once played Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart television commercials, and who left chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this current Johnny English movie.
I was fascinated by the scene where Johnny English comes to a helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while the rotating blades of the helicopter briefly tap against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humor feels understated and oddly redundant, especially as the serious film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer more convincing comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's meant for children and not for adults, and to me, Johnny English's silly misadventures are just not as original and focused as Atkinson's dumb-mouthed sketches in the person of Bean.
The consistent current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret Internet network of British spies revealing the identities of all the agents involved - a minor role for Kevin Eldon, unfortunately.
It's the last straw that breaks the camel's back for the prime minister, a pompous and combative figure who is already in for a total collapse of political dislike: Emma Thompson is making her move with this quasi-Theresa May character, but there's not much in the script one could work with.
Here, intelligence informs them that every single spy is in danger of having to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means the murmuring Johnny English in person, now hired as a school principal by a distinguished establishment, but who gives secret courses on how to become a spy: some cute jokes here, like the English set up a sort of school of rock-clad spy school.
English was shipped back to Whitehall for a brief briefing in an emergency and reunited with his old suffering sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a sober role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are all wrong in the name of Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and making the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's wife, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously in love with a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin an odyssey of farce-avoidance maneuvers: disguised as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they cause chaos aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English leaves behind some anarchy as he tries to put on a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the sketches have certainly been taken out for the final sequence, but as friendly and burschikos as everything is, it already has something of a children's television in the main.
It's rather mediocre.
And like all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that's worthy of her talent?
Labour denies they are developing a plan for Britons to introduce a four-day week, paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week but are paid for five days.
The party apparently wants the heads of companies to give back the savings they made through the artificial intelligence revolution by giving workers an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend but be paid.
Sources say the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and also with plans to lure the country in favour of the worker.
The move to a four-day workweek is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way to give workers the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It should not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that is consistent with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy and employee benefits and the party's general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to put forward such an idea, the Greens had already spoken out in the 2017 election campaign for a four-day week.
But this aspiration is not currently supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not general party policy and is not considered by the party".
Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim the power of "faceless dictators" and "profiteers" from the energy companies.
The Chancellor also plans that current shareholders and water companies will not be able to get investment here if a Labour government demands certain deductions on the grounds of wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the board of companies and the so-called Inclusive Ownership fund to give 10% of the profits of private sector companies to workers, who could then receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, 60 Minutes, whether the Kavanaugh investigation could change the minds of the people here.
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a light vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the FBI's findings could convince Republican senators to give their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could come up with something new that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more successful than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I miss you, of course", Kennedy said.
As I entered the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called after this thing was done, and the charge came out, and said, Is it true?
He was determined, determined, single-minded.
But Graham's will is written in stone.
"My opinion on the Kavanaugh board is firm and there should be a particularly strong indictment to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: The board vehemently denied it", Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
And all the men that call them cannot prove anything.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new that could change the situation.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City is hosting the Global Citizen Festival again, an annual music event that features an immensely impressive lineup of performing stars, but with an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is worth bringing thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only see acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), people attending the concert must complete a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or performing other tasks that help to end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, with only 12 years left to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an honest way to demand people to take action or is it another case of clicktivism where people think they would make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has registered more than 11 million shares of its supporters since 2011 that are targeted at various causes.
They say that these actions have helped them get global leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and reports that came from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the money raised has impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the key commitments, including The Power of Nutritution, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to helping children reach their full potential, has promised after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen to give Rwanda $35 million to fight malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can bring the social injustice of malnutrition to a footnote in history", Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at the Live Concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions have been addressed to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government has announced financial support for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which is worth reaching more than 5 million women and children with nutrition support.
In response to a FAQ on the website, which asks "What makes you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's worth going the long and hard way sometimes I fall and fail.
But like all the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed if we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are just a few of the artists who will be performing in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as hosts.
US could use naval blockade to restrict Russian energy exports  Interior Minister
Washington said it would deploy the navy if necessary to prevent Russian Energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, as US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has betrayed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - where they are operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is all just a square to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they want to be in the Middle East, just like they want to be in Eastern Europe and there in the southern part of Europe, they want to be in the energy", he apparently said.
And if one can believe in him, there are always ways to approach it.
"The United States of America has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade to make sure that the energy here does not go to market", he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an American NGO that sees itself as the voice of the energy consumer.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran and noted that they are essentially the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are more or less to exert pressure and replace fuel", he said, while in context, he sees Russia as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil fuels.
The allegations come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, which is a significantly cheaper option for European consumers.
To this effect, Trump administration employees, including Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow if Trump were to listen.
Moscow has often claimed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a cheap economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the vehement opposition to Washington's project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means to ease pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has drawn criticism from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is worth looking to God for a 2020 presidential candidate, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would look to God to see if she would run for president after the midterm elections.
At a rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our fucked-up government and that means a woman at the top", she said, according to voices at The Hill.
"On November 6th, I will give a good look at whether I will run for president".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am worried to my bones about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy", she said.
Warren has so far been open with his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, Freeden said Warren would of course need an FBI investigation before the election.
A study came out Thursday, however, showing that Warren's own voters are not lacking in wanting her to run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, seventy-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters think she should not run.
Thirty-two percent thought it was a good idea.
The poll showed more support for the governor of Vidrun, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of the move and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names mentioned in the context of the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions Palin's PTSD to the track at a Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he's been back home, I can relate to other families who are struggling with PTSD ramifications, and the injuries our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at a Donald Trump event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her decision the elephant in the room, saying that her son and other veterans recovered a little differently, they are harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what other soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, have brought with them.
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault against a woman, which was combined with a report of gross domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans victims of gang violence or domestic violence from asylum.
Representatives from 18 states and the District signed a memorandum amicus curiae (ami de la cour) in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the petitioner in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy has not been made public.
She said her partner and his violent gang members had mistreated her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She's been detained in Texas.
The states here, lawyers supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have a high number of asylum seekers coming to the US, as nations with constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy would ignore state law, federal law and international law.
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be adjudicated on the facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ruling is contrary to that principle", says the ami de la cour.
Defendants further argue in the brief that the policy would not allow immigrants entry, which would harm the U.S. economy, as they would likely become entrepreneurs, and a "significant supply of workers".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded in June that judges only grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on their race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 presentation of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts at Palu are desperate as the death toll doubles compared to survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly hopeless.
"Everything feels tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to calm her feverish baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
There is almost no clean water.
Residents were seen entering these ruined houses, looking through the ruined properties for anything they could save.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were crawling outside Palus Army Hospital, where patients were being treated due to the ongoing shortage of newcomers outside.
As he described the feeling of being on the fifth floor of the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter, experiencing a violent earthquake, he was moved to tears and tears.
There was no time to save us.
I was crushed in the ruins of the walls, I guess", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what's wrong with this place or my kid.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of bullying with propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement praising the benefits of mutual US-China trade in a US daily, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited China-funded advertising in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, which China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in US elections is a new phase in Washington's escalation campaign to pressure China, a US official told Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise for trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in a de-escalation trade war, which has led to higher tariffs being levied on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to hit exporting states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa - a major agricultural export state to China - says Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses to do the same.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, is now adding another ship to the list by putting propaganda ads in our free press.
By spreading propaganda, the government of China is continuing to violate the beloved and long-standing tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, the newspaper booth down the street in Beijing is a poor reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about the economic development of their country, as the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also said that one of the most popular Chinese newspapers did not want to publish his article, but did not know how.
Republicans are distancing themselves from women voters ahead of the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
While many top Republicans behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have come and gone to defend against various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned of a backlash in the interim, especially from women.
Emotions around the issue were extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
"These things can't be rolled back", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke to The Hill for an article published Sunday.
Reeher said that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute push for an FBI investigation was only worth bringing angry voters along.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told a Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
Friday's protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they walked out of the Senate aisle, while Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite a statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a Mic report.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are extreme values", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
Some say he is a demon, and that is true.
But it could be even higher, especially among so-called female swing voters, and the urban and young voters, 18-29-year-olds, who, although they didn't like the president, often didn't vote.
Even ahead of Ford's public testimony, in which she gives a detailed description of the sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest that it could backfire if Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's a confusing mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former Republican chairman of the National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just the committee vote or the light vote or whether Kavanaugh gets elected, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, told a television station.
But Americans seem to be somewhat divided about what to believe from the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there is a tendency to believe the latter more.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or perhaps believe Ford's statement, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
Plus, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely succeeded during his speech, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh abused her while she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals at a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup that is meant to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's lightweight project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored and who is allowed access to water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We need to do it now", said Wein about the start-up.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to open their own personal online data store or POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all on one browser at the same time, all the time.
What is unique about the "personal online data store" is that it is completely dependent on the user who can access what information.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
The idea for Inrupt, according to its CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, build skills and appropriate to make such a solid thing accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was acquired by IBM, a few mates who work as developers on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether or not they should implement a complete change where all these business models are turned upside down overnight.
We're not asking for permission here.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to deliver commercial energy to an ecosystem that is worthy of protecting the integrity and quality of the new web on solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he founded Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: World War I pastor honored with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman ever awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I was commemorated in his home village after 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was shot by a sniper four days later and never realized that he had been given the highest British military rank.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by a sampling of his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "genius" and symbolic that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the action of his head that won him the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through thick fog and under attack on the field by machine guns.
He later ran to the line of fire and led the battalion again, before taking a rifle with one hand and arresting three of the military unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot down by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather could not be justified but it was a humbling experience.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he feels very honoured to be part of the parade and also said that the courage of a true hero is proven by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this: You stay up all night looking for a rented Bellator 206 only to be denied the keys of the main racing circuit.
13 fights from San Jose were scheduled, including six on the main map and they were shown on Channel 5 all night live in the United Kingdom.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to go head-to-head, UK viewers were stunned when the coverage shifted to Peppa Pig.
Some were unmoved, having been kept awake until the early hours of the morning for the battle.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke".
"It's a government mandate that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program", David Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", you know.
Bellator's corporate president Scott Coker has said they want to revise their schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about replay, I think we can probably do that", Coker said.
"But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday morning and we're not going to be able to get this done by Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was turned on, they sent a lot of messages back and forth, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But there was no one, it was a legal problem.
I can assure you, next time it won't happen.
We're going to reduce the fight to five instead of six as we always do and we tried to deliver more to the fans, but we failed.
It is a deplorable situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lowly" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he got to high school that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him less likely to win the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a break for several months due to illness.
During his appearance as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt growing up "less worth it" than everyone else because "it was not socially accepted to love boys and girls".
He said: "Until now, the feelings of inferiority and differentness were the only things that gave us the strength and perseverance to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "worth something", he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone if they eventually found out about his sexual preferences.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is one of the most prominent LGBT advocates and he used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he said that because he feels happy to be able to be open and live without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man he met in 2013 - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age gap was never an issue.
"When you're that young, you're that far"  He competed in his first Olympics at the age of 1 and his father died of cancer three years later  He said it was hard to find someone as old as he was to have gone through the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about, 'I have to win a gold medal.'"
"You know what; there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died of cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was if they already had their tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not here to sit in the front row,'" he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and it was only when he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not unreachable", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there is no better feeling", he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song  Pride of Heather Small which he played in the background as he prepared for the Olympic Games and still caused him a bit of a scratch.
Desert Island Discs is on Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson's poor form at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the bench
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must regain his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for four-balls and fours on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often done for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day playing cheerleader and working on the pitch at his game, hoping to improve what he was planning.
Not even at the peak of his career he was the most prolific driver, and therefore the 48-year-old player is not the ideal line-up for the tight runs of Le Golf National, where the long Rough routinely punishes felt-guided shots.
And if the odds themselves aren't scary enough, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who is teaming up with starter Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans start the 12 singles games four points behind, have a tough start, then Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely important.
Furyk confided in her husband, and it's not like he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role for today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a strong sense of self-confidence.
He's on the best list and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it worked and how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be like everybody else out there".
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really reached the pinnacle of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence has brought far more tangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's moody, he likes to make fun of others and he's a wonderful person who's loved in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him on the road, and also this week, which was fun and uncomfortable.
He offers far more than just games".
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows knows that a great leap can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a pretty big lead for the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an uncomfortable lap.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but won it just after half-time with 141⁄2:131⁄2.[3]
"You always remember that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but only by a narrow margin", said Bjorn, exhausted after watching the 2018 class win both Friday and yesterday by 5-3 to take the Le Golf National by 10-6.
So the story will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
Go all out tomorrow.
Go out there and do it right.
This isn't over until you see dots on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try and win these trophies, and that's what we have to keep focusing on.
I've been saying it all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side -- the best players in the world".
Relieved when his players clashed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never put myself in the spotlight.
Tomorrow we have another beast before us.
Tomorrow is the only achievement that will come to pass, and that is another pair of shoes.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out alone, you're tested to the limit as a golfer.
That's the message to the players: Do your best tomorrow.
Send your servant away, and let him go in peace.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk wants his players to beat each other better individually as they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Furyk himself knows both sides of the big turnaround, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before they went down as losers of the place, as Europe played out the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember a damn word from everyone", he said in response to a question when Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered his players before the final day.
"We have 12 great players tomorrow, but you want to keep the fast start you saw in Brooklyn, you saw in Medina.
If the pendulum swings in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We set our stand accordingly and set the people up as we felt we could prepare tomorrow".
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the offense and is facing Rory McIlroy in the main cast, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European on the other half of the lineup.
"I chose this essay because I think it covers everything", Bjorn said of his individual choices.
The new German battleship is again moved to Hanne
The German Navy's latest frigate was commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but it will not be completed until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing costs, according to local media.
The order for the Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the Baden-Württemberg class of frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military consultant.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery saw the fate of the ambitious project stalled.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy ordered in 2007, are intended as replacements for the older Bremen-class frigates.
They have a powerful cannon, a barrage of air and surface-to-air missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods  it should be possible for the newest frigates not to run home for up to two years.
But the constant delays mean that the innovative warships - which are supposed to prove Germany's strength at sea - are already obsolete before they even enter service, notes "Die Zeit".
The F125 frigate, which was followed by the accident, made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the shipment, but German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have rendered the ship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by a crew of almost 120 sailors - half the size of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was much too heavy, which reduced its performance and hampered the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project  including the training of the team  is also a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion)  from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are particularly important because of recent warnings that the German naval strike force is being destroyed.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was "spending the unseaworthy ships".
The official said the problem has worsened over time as old ships are being scrapped but no new ones are being prepared.
He speculated that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates would be able to join the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of the Flanders corn
A new study on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how farmed pigs use the countryside to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flight mementos and help to develop guidelines for future conservation activities.
The study is being conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and follows common and monkey-plant corn but also brown Laangour and Daubenton plant corn at Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key locations around the plot to monitor the midget's activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers are also carrying out mobile scans with the help of hand detectors.
Based on expert analysis of all the recordings, the frequency of the flying circles and what kind of what is it doing is determined.
A map and habitat report are then produced to create a detailed picture of their landscape-scale behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the ground mice and how they are used by each species.
This information helps to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of forests and how best to manage forest areas for maize and other similar species.
The population of the flat-footed mouse has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom over the last century.
They are threatened by buildings and development that have a negative impact on their habitat and habitat loss.
Wandering and lightning can also pose a risk, as can mosquito bites and chemical treatments of building materials, but also attacks by domestic cats.
Flanders are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to the tracks of prey.
They use a highly advanced echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes the plantation very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly perform scans, sleeping spot inspections and occasional rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat sanctuary at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which provides habitat for eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Land manager David Thompson says the plot is the ideal landscape for them.
"Here in Threave we have a wonderful area for planting maize", he said.
"We have the old buildings, the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there's still a lot we don't know about corn, and the work we're doing here and elsewhere is helping us better understand what it needs to thrive".
He stressed the importance of searching for farm corn before performing maintenance on land, as unnecessary destruction of a single breeding habitat could kill up to 400 female and young farm corn and possibly wipe out an entire local population.
Pigs are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish director of the Bat Conservation Trust, called on the public to jump in and help.
She said, "We have a lot to learn about the corn, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies rape charges and his lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegation against him a "fake news" by saying that people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers want to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the false allegations.
The star of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid $375,000 to keep the incident from becoming public, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When speaking in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they are saying today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"She wanted to promote herself by using my name.
That is normal.
They will be called by my name, but this is the work.
I'm a happy and very good man", the player added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the false allegations, which they call "unauthorized reporting of suspicions of privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player wants to pursue compensation for "moral damage with an amount that matches the severity of the violation, which will be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and the Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room where he had, according to documents from Clark County District Court in Nevada, allegedly raped her anal.
The mayorga claims Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" apart from the "some percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claimed that he had gone to the police and had photographs of his injuries, which were shot in the hospital, but later agreed to settle the case à l'amiable because he was "greatly afraid of reprisals" and was afraid of being "publicly executed".
The 34-year-old woman says she would now try to end the marriage because she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was in the process of transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer he was transferred to Italian top-flight club Juve for a fee of €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will be ready for ever' to lose carmakers
The UK "would be ready for it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading carmaker, Economy Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily suspend production at their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant  where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are produced  produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade should work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is saying that they will close their mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are linked to what the carmakers say are the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is running "synchronous production", with parts being ordered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border, which according to the industry could lead to delays and parts closures.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock for more than a day at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus halt production.
Mr Clark told Theresa May her Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid the checks at the border".
"We want the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success now, but to seize the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The statement not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we absolutely must be able to demonstrate what has been a hugely successful supply chain setup".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run they warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader of Unite at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have worked out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Sun adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating cases of possible Russian interference in elections, ties between Trump supporters and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the number one topic of discussion in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about being banned from recording conversations with Trump and about the possibility of impeaching the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and reportedly was preaching there.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to "expose" Rosenstein, but the meeting was called off to avoid a crossover with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct, both exonerated.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she replied: "There is no date set for it yet, it could be this week, it could be that I have to postpone it for another week, with all the other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we're still seeing that, and I always like to keep the press on the edge".
Some reporters questioned the claim: Sanders had not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace has asked.
Sanders felt that the lack of information sources was not due to a dislike of television reporters who are aiming for "effectshearing", although she admitted: "I don't deny the fact that they are doing effectshearing".
She suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased again.
"The president is holding more R&D sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without proof: "We've looked at the numbers".
Information leaks are still taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president questions directly, that's definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that and you've seen that we've done a lot of that in the last few weeks, and that's going to replace a press conference in the future when you can talk to the President of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or speeches at visiting press conferences.
Press conferences alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have proved why by making a rather bizarre and bizarre appearance in front of a gathering of reporters.
Health minister hired EU staff at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff at the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of a contract for a regular status for EU citizens working in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'The negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have progressed over the summer and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay".
Emergency surgery for Christion Abercrombie after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in the 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Tennessee Tigers' Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the village and broke down there", Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline and placed him on a beer and brought him closer for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris added that there are "no details yet on the nature/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
This is Abercrombie, a sophomore college athlete, in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp duty when buying land in the UK
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp duty when buying land in the UK, with the additional tax under the Tory plan being used to help the homeless.
The move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The stamp duty is levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury experts expect it to rise to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying land in the UK, with the additional tax under the Tory plan being used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing, and target goodwill.
The stamp duty increase is imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money increasing the government's fight against street slumbers.
The additional tax  which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second-class and buy-to-let homes  could be as high as three percent.
The Finance Ministry experts expect the move to be worth £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK citizens, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many affluent areas in the country  especially in the capital  are becoming "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new guidelines come just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping land prices high by buying land but not using it, and he urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing to curb Britain's "housing boom".
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of striking housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to forced evictions "without fault".
He also wants to give the council more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would use my time as Prime Minister to revive the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
It cannot be true that it is for non-UK residents, and also for foreign companies, to buy housing like British beer.
For too many people, the dream of a home is too far away, and the humiliation of sleeping on the streets is too real".
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "biggest ambition" is to one day become manager of Scotland.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of re-entering the North-East club, who are just in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He joined Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership (Scotland's 1st League) last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Sport Sound.
"But I grew up watching a lot of Scottish games with my dad in Hampden as a kid and that's something that always drew me back.
But the opportunity would only come if I was successful in running the club".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not afraid to follow such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success is measured by the question 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
"The structure and equipment of this club makes it a Premier League club without a doubt", he said.
"It is not an easy task to get there, but I would consider myself successful here only if I can bring the club back there".
Ross has only three years of experience as a manager, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to gain promotion from the relegation to the third tier and turn St Mirren from relegation candidate to championship title winner the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than he has ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real divorce", he recalls when he took over Alloa.
"I really felt that the management was right for me to play even more like.
It sounds strange, but I've done well, can live well from it and enjoyed some moderate highs.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things to go through each week.
I still do that as stress and pressure through the work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now that I'm doing it, it feels like the best thing I've ever done in my entire adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is, according to one study, at 5:30 on Sunday.
The summer heat wave has boosted the recipes of British pubs struggling to survive, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin of consultancy firm CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and the longer than expected England participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, with pubs having 2.8 per cent more turnover, except restaurants suffered even more.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restoration in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars in which drinking was done were cut far more heavily than restaurants had on the floor.
Pubs and eateries have also suffered under the sun, though not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems as if people just want to go for a drink.
In all the pubs and bars they run, the sale of drinks went up 6.6 percent that month, and the sale of food went down 3 percent".
Paul Newman, leisure and hotel analyst at RSM, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales on the foreign market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales is in addition to the ongoing cost-cutting pressures particularly as well.
The long, extremely hot summer could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the much-anticipated respite".
In July, sales in all pubs and restaurants, including reopening, rose by 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowdown in brand reopening.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of £9 billion and is the established industry reference point.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children -- some of them as young as 11 -- has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a surge in "fake" Insta sites
The news fueled fears that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" that they showed their parents.
One in five children - half of whom are just 11 - create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake" Instagram accounts - a play on the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The post fueled fears that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they would run a reduced "main" account, which they would show to their parents, while they also had a private one.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who shouted, "Rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to running private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle becomes "speaker of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Supervisors at the Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and chairman Ian Beattie saw the move as a significant opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the athletics community from across Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from having us on the committee", says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be acting as a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope I can really contribute something and help promote the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and holds a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC pundit, can no longer walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and how much I would recover.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I do mobility exercises!
Thanks for the updates!"
An advertisement for milk pumps comparing mothers to cows is attracting teenagers online
A milk pump company ran an online ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows that are being milked, arousing the children.
To launch the so-called "world's first inconspicuous drip milk pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a non-threatening music video-inspired commercial to highlight the freedom that mothers  who pump milk  enjoy with the new pump.
Four real moms dance in a pool of blood to a song that includes the following lines: "Yes, I'm stroking myself, but you don't see a dick" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't ears, these are my breasts".
The choir continues: "Pump off, pump off, I'm feeding my babies, pump off, pump off, I'm feeding my ladies".
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has triggered mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just as we must they get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their young are removed a few days after birth", one wrote.

Another commented: "Certainly traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to market a milk pump to mothers who are breastfeeding their babies?"
Another added: "Such a tasteless advertisement".
Others defended the ad, with one mother admitting that she found the song "very strange".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I could still afford it.
The pumps made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I understood it exactly as it was intended.
This is a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad that targets moms who pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is very discreet, has no wires or no strings and fits discreetly into a bracelet, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out during the discharge.
Ana Balarin, partner at ECD at Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a quick and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and breastfeeding, we wanted to highlight breastfeeding and the challenges that come with it, while demonstrating it in a fun and tangible way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mom ran across the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country by signing up to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of children of people who had pleaded guilty to sponsoring unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior convictions.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or members of sponsors are in the country illegally and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to keep chasing these people", Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials, according to the undercover workers, introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days (the previous standard).
Many appear via videoconferencing instead of in person to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for the aid are quickly expelled.
The longer the children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which, according to undercover agents and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, can lead to violent escapes or escape attempts.
Lawyers have indicated that these concerns are heightened in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs are more likely to be seen as a child struggling due to the facility's size.
They added that sending children to the campsite without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma they are struggling with.
Syria demands that the US, France and Turkey immediately withdraw their "occupation"
Ahead of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country now lasting eight years.
Al-Mualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be led along with them accordingly".
"They must go back immediately and unconditionally", he told the congregation.
Al-Mualem insisted that the "war on terror in Syria is as good as over", where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue its "holy struggle until we clear all Syrian areas" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, al-Moualem said conditions were in place for them to return and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that urged refugees to stay away.
"We have turned to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and he expressed the hope that the military action would take the visors of jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who are "deleted".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members will convene soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Al-Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the council's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Wins a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal observers likely hope, a impeachment or scandal ends his presidency early.
What would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidency that has ever happened!"
But so far there are no signs of fatigue among the spectators.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with no less than 3.5 million viewers on prime-time nights.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, series director of ABC's "Designated Survivor" about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
Remembered a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for the Lord Trump.
Why? he asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the White House's actions could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring that is a luxury that only the most privileged of viewers can afford.
And yet it overwhelms the understanding of an informed citizen to be able to attend six hours of self-reported panel discussions by experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "in-depth background" as the source for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 straussle-leader bomber jacket (according to The Washington Post, "a gesture full of exaggeration"), and Stormy Daniels' comments on his elaborate descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario again with the same eyes as before.
"Part of what he does is make it sound like a reality show that he's giving you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's show with its rotating cast and daily unpredictable conspiracies (when you're dealing with the NFL, Kim Jong-un is praised).
One cannot afford to miss a follow-up, otherwise one cannot get closer.
When I reached Mr. Meat this week, it was sunny with about 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was busy watching MSNBC and he was also recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not with Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember watching all those crazy shows and people saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Flesh told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right".

Money flows from outside and the nearest midterm elections for the race for the house
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th District is seeing a cash flow, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that have won two office holders in a race for the same seat.
This recently redistributed suburb of Pittsburgh is a disadvantage to Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb who won his seat in a sunny whale last spring in another district.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the district's old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were reviewed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th has triggered a sharp swap for campaign funding between the main funder, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name after a narrow victory in a much-watched sun whale in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight lead.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but dropped it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much opposition from the United States.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. leaders from their diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only penalties were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would cut financial aid payments and reduce visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rate.
With progress in internal meetings, officials from North and Central America have moved a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to deter migrants from making their way to the United States.
But in mid-September, leading officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and effectively ended any consideration of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence must now prepare the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the import the administration is setting for the meetings, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new updates or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was led by three American House members, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on the terms of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learning from history
Your next job message could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now being corroborated by evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress is reconstituted, Mr. Trump will have to answer to the newly reconstituted Congress, shortly before he will have to appear before the voters again, and perhaps even a jury of his peers.
These are many conditions, and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable  or that of his European counterparts.
We must all make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of this conflict.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that resulted.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's relentless march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing some of these turning points right now.
What do we do when Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is steering the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he was secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not up for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is flawed.
What will be our reaction if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is sworn in to the Supreme Court, even though there are credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony against him?
And, most importantly, will we elect a Congress in the midterm that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not meet these challenges, bad times are coming for democracy.
But I think we will not fail, because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me away to light Sabbath candles on the swastika-covered table.
With that in my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the rapid Vienna fight
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday realised that the win against Austria, after an impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month in Spain, puts them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season since the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game thinking we were going to get something and they went home with a point.
We might have known it at the end of the day, but, on the whole, a game of chance is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we were in the second half on the better side.
This Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but this will be a difficult match because they had a good result in their last match but, with the spectators on our side, I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself but it feels good now.
The squad is good and the boys are all having a lot of fun; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now and leave the last season behind and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of this fear of pension savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the individuals in this Nationwide study said they would talk to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide, her life insurance company.
That's how you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: Your family will not be prepared to support you if your spouse does not make your wishes known early enough.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how the child will receive care, as these choices play an important role in calculating costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay the costs.
Your options for paying for your long-term care include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid cash value life insurance to help cover the costs or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts
Establish a health insurance proxy so that a person you trust can oversee your health care and ensure that professionals will be able to follow your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Consider also an authority for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make your financial decisions and to ensure that bills are paid should your door fail.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in a written plan so that you are ready to open the door.
"It's not just the finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's looking after the dog?
Have a plan in place.
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun while walking home after a night out.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His wounds are not life-threatening and the police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian state of Palu on Friday, according to the report, with the death toll expected to rise.
As communication facilities were being disrupted, official aid could not get information from Donggala Regency, an area in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a shallow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was about to celebrate its 40th birthday when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300km (180 miles) of the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Copper mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis frequently in the last 100 years, according to information from the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed about 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on a seismic cycle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Menawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hit the Pyidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remember the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaksa governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was charged with domestic violence, soliciting a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the suspected crimes, he took away his phone.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He was in court on Saturday, where he declared that he was "certainly not guilty" when asked for a guilty plea, the broadcaster said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, soliciting a domestic violence crime report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans groups for seeing her son's violent behavior and connection to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck a short distance from the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social networks show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want rare death sentences for suspects in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out the attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, and overran pedestrians and cyclists who were in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the letter of intent to seek the death penalty filed by the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could lead to a possible death sentence, according to court records.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for aiding and abetting extortion, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation", prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "cruel, terrible and wasteful".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, grief, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York pursued a death penalty case for rape.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told the investigator that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told the agency he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of theft.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to envisage the death penalty, rather than a plea and life in prison without the possibility of parole, will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked not to consider the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to mobilize the People's Army during a protest at a Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should be "heated" by Eurosceptics while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would be out of the way if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to bring the deeply divided ranks back together has been underscored by pro-Remain Tories who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The PM has trouble keeping track of her Chequers compromise plan around attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that it should continue to fight to get a deal with Brussels, despite the backlash and force Eurosceptics in Labour to choose either its package or chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he was pulling the checks because he was.
He suggested that the Lord should give Farage a peer and give him responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he were willing, " he said", we would have come out by now".
Wellingborough MP added: "I am in favour of Brexit but we have to get the checks out".
Making his opposition to the EU clear, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: the idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who are really going through the streets and leading us to get elected at all.
When I love let chequers fall and start listening.
In a message aimed at Mrs May, it added: "The prime ministers will keep their jobs if they keep their promises".
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must feel "heat" if they were to abandon the 2016 referendum decision.
'There is now trust between us, the people and our political class,' he said.
They are trying to get Brexit over with and we are here today to tell them we will not let you get away with it.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I think our political class, which is on the verge of leaving Brexit, is feeling the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners around the group's founding this weekend.
Labour Peer Lord Adonis has been teasing the Conservatives over the security issues they had with a party app as the conference began.
'These are the people who tell us they know how to install the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland', an attachment said.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is planning to consider running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrat Samsen spoke about her future during a speech at City Hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Has been the center of speculation that he would run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the city hall format since Trump took office.
One participant asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our fucked-up government, and that meant a woman had to be in charge.
It came at a party after the fatal shooting of LSU Sims
Baton Rouge, LA police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET at the press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help in identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to help his colleague and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, with a gun, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is closer to the world title after the team series win over Sebastian Vettel.
It was clear that the Mercedes team line-up would play a big role in the race as Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From pole position, Bottas got off to a good start and almost took Hamilton out while defending his position in the first two tiers and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and led Hamilton to the end of the pack, which should have been the deciding moment.
Mercedes then drove a lap into the pits and was behind the wheel when it came out, but Hamilton took first after a wheel-to-wheel action, as the Ferrari driver had to accidentally release the ball and risk still waiting to defend the third corner after a double over.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He was then first for a majority of the race while keeping his tyres in place to avoid a quick finish and to take over from Kimi Raikkonen to become fourth.
He finally drove into the pits on lap 44 but was unable to pick up his pace in the final eight laps, while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough job because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did such an exceptional job of having one two, Hamilton said.
That was very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for insisting that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that the people are "evil and wicked and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and that is beautiful is what happened during the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and hateful and dishonest", he said.
"When you look at something that's been made public and leaked and you say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer...did you read the document - 2oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak.
But, wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn't leak", he added as he asked the senator for his vote.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied knowing the leak from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reports.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he asked.
But his denial didn't go down well with the president, who commented during the rally one Saturday: "I'm telling you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president, who went on to nominate his Supreme Court defense, which was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, went on to suggest that Democrats would use the allegations for their own purposes.
They want to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the ugliness, they don't care who they are, how they have to overcome to get power and control", the media reported as the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for the loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the replay 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early on with two goals from strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before the Giants were pushed back by Dwyer.
Francois Bouchard was sent off for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goalkeepers secured the victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on a Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 and brought the game before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's his draw at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants would take a lead into the first half as he shot the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to level with a hard-fought goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second half and he ensured that they won with his team their fifth in the half of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Fluchlots die to make sure that hundreds of people can escape in the plane before an earthquake.
A pilot in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died while trying to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely got off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are still missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong winds continued to blow and many were caught in the storm of the city of Paulus.
But although his co-workers fled for their lives, 21-year-old Alan Anthonyus Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly wobbly control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
Meir prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
When we heard this, our hearts were broken.
However, agencies feared the death toll could rise to thousands, while the country's disaster relief agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The number is expected to continue to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble while others are inaccessible", said agency spokesman Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high destroyed Palu, where a mass grave is being held on Sunday.
Military and transport aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets have been filled in everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is moving quickly to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete your tasks in the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says now that one man is missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline that operated a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing after it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was about to be lowered.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that they will not be able to accommodate a male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The agency reported on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers would remain in hospital on Saturday, and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of the fire remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon, not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane went over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had landed very low.
"That's an extremely good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the water, which reached to the hips, to the safety exit of the plane, which was about to sink.
He said the stewards panicked and chased him and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working on improvements at a shipyard also helped in the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicated that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst tracks the time of night in which a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday concluded their case in a second investigation of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has been hailed as an expert in intelligence analysis
He retracted for the jury how he used cell phone data to track the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from multiple cell phone operators that showed the Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his statements from one source, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford issued a statement, claiming that the roof had not been in the city.
When investigators asked if Tellis was telling the truth about being in Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records showed they'd only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He had taken it out of his life", said Hale.
It is planned that the defense will begin to give its final arguments.
The judge told him he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed What is Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and the solution of social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently become popular in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
NY child girl sues couple for firing after a racist text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly addressed text message from her mother, who complained that she was "after a black man".
The couple denies being racist, and liken the complaint to blackmail
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when she found out that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"Nobody's in a hurry", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice, twice.
After noticing the faux pas, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Madame Maurice, explaining that the child who had just left had done a poor job, an African-American, and that he would have expected a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Madame Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home by coach.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation from the dismissal, and expects compensation of about $350 per month for the six-month job she would have lived in the house she was originally hired for, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that", said a cheerful post, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered the claims that they were racist, saying it was the sensible decision to take down Maurice's position, fearing they could not trust him after they had offended him.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
Has not been racist.
We are not racist people", the man, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
Shall thy children be given into the hand of him with whom the wicked hath a quarrel?
Your newborn baby?
I'm going to go.
Plasco said, while comparing the complaint to "blackmail", that his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would he run after such a person?
This is not a nice way to act", the investment banker added.
While the trial was still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, dismissing them for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington publishers feared that readers might not have been able to relate to a beer that was talking to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to get used to someone who reads it first before it's published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's success.
It said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a little teddy bear, would be devastated if his work was not accepted, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books "will be after his death last year".
Of Paddington, who describes it as "a very important family member", it says that his father was quietly proud of his later success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not one to be mocked", it said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like someone could have accomplished something: one is really proud of it even if it's not one's own creation.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit in that direction.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called many times to say it looked very bad, that it was not expected to be picked up", said Madame Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm with her.
I'll be with her.
The medication doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly began to fail and left his system.
It had died a short time before and that was just the end.
I was just supposed to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going to happen.
I couldn't whine or scream or cry because I was in a situation with family and people.
I really need to get my act together.
Finally, Madame Ednan-Laperouse, at that moment in mourning over the loss of her daughter, had to climb into the plane with the other passengers without knowing what she had to go through.
"I don't know", he said.
"I bowed my head, and tears continued to fall.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I've developed an immense sympathy for the nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved.
Women in mourning send cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys sent cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support, to a Welsh bridge.
Mrs Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and took his own life at 18.
I don't think parents need to feel the way I do", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a burning smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his laughter would go no matter what room.
But he left his job before he died, because he was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his half-brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I am constantly making sure that it is worth the consequences.
Mrs. Davis made the cards to tell people that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, you have to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, not long after the death of her mother.
He didn't say that he felt bad or depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that we were acting differently.
It was Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that they had to admit: "It's a laughing stock for the whole family.
It's rapping us out.
But we all have to keep doing it and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what it asked for - a time-limited survey, with limited scope - then maybe we could achieve some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "fall apart" into a sheltered partisan stance.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their will is entirely about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans get a bad result, they will be severely weakened in their bid to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces their report?
There will be an election in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can win at least 50 Senate seats, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to pass a tie and be sworn in to the Supreme Court.
North Korea surrender numbers fall under Kim
The number of North Korean survivors heading to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker says.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the Ministry of Unification in the south and said there were 1,127 survivors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and higher costs for smugglers would play a big role.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the survivors from the North eventually receive a South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that, since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and the easiest to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views survivors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to its country.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war with each other - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the halted denuclearization talks.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general that they should work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions it will be impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court in his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like that, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has alleged that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers in an emotional dispute.
While Kavanaugh's previous statement was highly emotional, some of it was chasing or drowning while he was talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated smear campaign" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's statements proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he voted against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he went about attacking the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi expressed concern when asked if there would be an attempt to impeach Kavanaugh if he were sworn in, and whether Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying here, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court where he belongs", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she, as a Democrat, was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is seen as conservative justice.
In his remarks, Kavanaugh avoided questions about the possibility that he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time to take a hysterical, partisan person to court and then expect us to say 'it's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to practice it.
It is a just hatred, months and years of anger that wriggles, and has not gotten it out without crying.
"We cry when we are given roses", Madame Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find that unusual, do you?
She goes on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a leader somewhere, where she said that she would cry when she was angry, but that she developed a technique, which means that if she gets angry and starts crying, she then tells the person she's talking to, "You probably think I'm brave because I'm crying.
I am angry.
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that was brilliant.
Tears are partly allowed as an outlet for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of a previous job, in a mostly male office, where I was crashing down with indescribable anger, was when an elderly woman took me to the crosswalk - a cold manager I had always been a little afraid of - and dragged me down a flight of stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", I said.
"They don't know that you are a rose.
They will rejoice because you are sad, and they will be glad because you are back.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was mentioned in an outlandish affair on a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, with great frustration, thought that she should not think any further about the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was yet another.
One called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it was late in the campaign, it was behind with the fundraiser, so it swore it wouldn't go on the campaign trail unless it raised $2 million.
It was a battle that had been lost.
He found out that some of his supporters who gave the men $1,000 only gave him $250.
"How many of them will I have to forgive?" he asked.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude for the people who had been supporting him, frustration with the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and to target voters and non-delegates, and anger at sexism - that it made him lose his voice.
"You might think I was having a nervous breakdown", recalls Madame Schroeder about the press's reaction to her.
You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my grave?
Did it crash?
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first waves of the US-China trade war have been a bit of a shock, and even if the fight is far from over, a break between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warnings earlier this year by imposing tariffs on a major Chinese export, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was this week with new tariffs hitting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), so that in the end half of the goods coming from China to the US were taxed.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated, recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to join the US in the crossfire, and the world's second largest economy will not push it so quickly.
If they want to get Washington to stop, they have to respond to demands, but publicly humiliating themselves in front of the US would be too much of a disgrace for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But experts say that if Beijing makes the right decisions, the U.S. pressure on China in the trade war could be positive in the long run because it would reduce the interconnectedness of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could trigger an economic whirlwind in both countries is ultimately far more dangerous than viewers have realized so far", said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center for New American, a think tank focused on Asia.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome back refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the return of refugees who want to return to their country and who have been forced to flee due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and living conditions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not accept unconditional aid or aid from countries that had sponsored the uprising.
Europe finishes with Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain and his team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for much of the tournament, shot his tee shot into the water at par-3 on the 16th hole, thus losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his races, becoming one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record since the 1979 tournament.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with 5&4 by the worst player in the European team standings, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, has fallen 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia of Spain, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most career wins of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for taking me along and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm happy that I could help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He will be given the torch to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated US legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles match on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel in beating Tiger Woods, I watched him grow up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the entire tournament on a high level of golf.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of his squad, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
There were moments in the mornings when we showed Europe our celebration.
We fought.
Hat for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
One must take one's hat off.
We were overwhelmed.
Red Tide Update: Concentration is decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission says that in the Tampa Bay area, Red Tide concentrations are generally declining.
The FWC reports more gaping remaining conditions in the vicinity of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating decreasing concentrations.
A bloom of the Red Tide stretches about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
Patches can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places compared to last week.
The Red Tide was also seen in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County have been reported in the past week, deep to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, deep to high concentrations in Manatee County, deep to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, deep to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, deep to high concentrations off the coast of Lee County and deep concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory problems are still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory problems have been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
