A Republican strategy to counter the reelection of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center dismisses the latter as a myth, affirming that election fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers, by the way, have only registered 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are in part undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in each state.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have enacted new laws that make the registration process or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to produce photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court record exists.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states that would force voters to show photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such ID cards.
However, it is often necessary to pay more than a hundred dollars to obtain the necessary identification.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo identification.
This goes even further.
Students, who are considered voters who increasingly cast their votes for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID cards issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
Because it's obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states promoted legislation that eliminated voter registration on Election Day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections helped register some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the number of new voters registered in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the length of early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the early voters were African-American, even though they make up only 13% of the state's electorate.
The same is true for the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who represented 76% of the electorate, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The US Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the showing of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the laws passed and see in them a clear goal to influence the results in the states that will determine the outcome of 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine in part the democratic system of the United States.
Early Prostate Cancer Screening: Should I Do the Test or Not?
The PSA test does indeed sometimes give incorrect results, with false negatives or false positives, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater hesitation of the already undecided men to perform early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We've had two medical experts give us their opinion.
In the US studies, there were many interferences between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality between patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that, at a follow-up of 12 years, the probability of metastasis is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was made.
So I recommend the test at age 50, or 40 if you have a close relative who has had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as you have been diagnosed with cancer.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made to understand the extent of the risk of his cancer, by showing him the possible options for prostate cancer that can be left untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, the choice is more likely to be active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and life-threatening.
They are advised to be monitored actively and offered treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be treated are increasingly defined.
That's why I still recommend you take the test.
Most important, though, is to speak with his doctor to determine whether or not it should be done.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30 percent of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and got enough exercise.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unknown.
The Canadian Cancer Society has made the fight against tobacco dependence a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It's also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It is very harmful to people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today", said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the company.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, colon, rectal, oesophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life is protective against colorectal cancer", he adds.
The Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer", he explains.
Other
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
But your investigation is inconclusive at this time.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are conflicting.
While one study found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family stress with his doctor.
"The performance of an early detection test does not lead to cancer".
The Higgs boson is analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model - our best or "least-false" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But physicists are not yet completely sure that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data are still lacking to be completely certain.
But let's assume that it's the Higgs, because there's a slight risk of being wrong, and let's see what it is.
There is an inescapable law in this world that makes it impossible for two objects to be in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and don't try too hard, because you will hurt yourself.
Because even if particle physics is a really weird world, it turns out that it also has a law of its own: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they're in the same "quantum state", and that "state" is basically some of their properties.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, called fermions, who are obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a vicious bunch of anarchists, who have no sanctity -- certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the Berkeley Lab's The Particle Adventure website (which is absolutely amazing by the way), fall into two groups: the mesons, which we won't cover here, and the "force particles", through which the great forces of nature propagate, and with which the Higgs boson is somehow related.
But it's important to note that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as you might think.
If you're able to read this chronicle, it's only because of a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or "light particle", which is the messenger of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at that exact spot, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon, and thus one of the "force carriers" bosons.
Stabilized field
The same is true for the Higgs boson, except that another field, the Higgs field, must be "interrupted" for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the agent must reach very high energies, somewhat like a frozen pond whose surface could only be scratched by a very large rock.
So it takes a giant particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 kilometers! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - for example, a piece of paper would never stick to the refrigerator by itself.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field equally: those that do have mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What good can all this research be for, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to closely examine any discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, many physicists who are most eager to see such deviations found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (ups again!).
However, no such anomalies have been found at CERN so far.
Effects
The effects of this research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there are none.
By the way, back in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Labs had no idea that their work would spark such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s and who himself developed the first continuous-wave laser in 1962 (the first ones were pulsed) - has already told us that the laser was initially seen as more of a "laboratory prank".
I mean, imagine that.
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle, while working in optics, developed a small light sensor.
Although not its original purpose, this sensor now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras worldwide, and it won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the LHC's activities will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care is the best way to die.
Recently, Quebec has discussed the sensitive issue of end-of-life with its Committee on "Dying with Dignity".
Debate must resume shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that had eaten him up had left him with a two-year deadline.
"They gave me five years to live, I've made seven years", he said halfheartedly, lying in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"It's always a shock, though, and you can't be prepared for it", he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even from eating himself.
Sitting at a table enjoying a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to be helped to eat.
He even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that they cure my diarrhea, because this is humiliating", he shared.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man peeing while standing", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor Gadbois Home.
To return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step back", he says.
Because according to several people who work in palliative care, big events are happening in the midst of these regressions.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor Gadbois Hospice are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are no longer showered with so-called "curative" care by the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For Mrs A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by asphyxiation".
But through the illness, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no more desires in life", she says before accepting to wear a mask to help her breathe.
She is still expecting a final visit from her son, who is coming from Italy.
The Victor Gadbois Home offers a group of volunteers to provide personal care and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 residents.
That's very little, considering that we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the nurses at the home.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given a mouthwash of brandy or Pepsi, as desired.
The diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike", says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing.
At Victor's Home for the Aged, no day is like any other.
Besides a 93-year-old man enjoying the final family gathering in the courtyard, well supported by his pillow as his honor is bowed, a young man of 36 years old, surrounded by his parents, wife, and two small children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have been occupied by cancer patients under 45", says Dr. Christiane Martel with concern.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois Home come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, which is care that is designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when they reach the end of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this gross inadequacy of Quebec's health care system that is causing several doctors specialising in palliative care to oppose the passage of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulated by prominent figures in palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, expressing their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not capable of ensuring that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with severe pain and no relief.
I'm afraid the only reason patients want to die is because they're not getting proper health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are treating their patients with the worst prognoses, and they're stuck until the very last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped a painful chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she told me that she regretted that I had given up the fight, she said.
But she told me I was finished!
No omnipotent care is needed
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not granting their wish after their pain has been relieved by a team of palliative care.
But it must be made clear that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which involves putting the patient to sleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the option of resorting to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same phrase, "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep", but "I want my pain to be alleviated".
The report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Every day, officials from the road construction industry, construction companies, political party fundraisers and specialists from the Italian mafia tell us what they know about a great "system" in which construction companies, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi are involved.
An industry that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has been falling apart since the drastic measures were taken", quips Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him following an in-depth investigation of embezzlement in connection with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The 'Duchesneau report' established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribes to public officials.
"Since the inquiry began in 2010", he says, "the Department of Transportation alone would have saved $1 billion in contracts", because some were harnessing their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping to "unmask the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which was established in 2011, and its troops are also working hard to target government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Also, the officers of the "Marteau" squad, who since 2009 have caused the Montreal "sewer cartel" to be more cautious in the artificial inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has launched a series of house searches and has brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban area.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The charges were brought against engineers from the Montreal Road Board and Italian entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused a sensation by explaining to the Commission the operation of the system for the award of public contracts.
He himself paid for several years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito had his hand in everything in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals in power at the time.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked without a hitch.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail to the Commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games from the construction company, as well as bribes of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts whose cost he artificially inflated.
Other officials at the Roads Department have admitted that they were duped into artificially inflating the bills by 30 to 40 percent using false surcharges.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that was filling his coffers with black money.
In the wake of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the municipality of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a municipal property in 2010 which was acquired for 5 million dollars and sold for 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
She says that the research that is eventually done "is a thread that allows us to understand the workings of the ant-infiltrated system to stop the evil and to prosecute the perpetrators".
She says the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we would need an investigative unit dedicated only to Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials stole several hundred million dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "the officials who are aware of the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting with a 70% black money contribution to the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak dismissal of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which it says would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in politics".
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing political parties: "We cannot fall further; by going to the bottom with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid foundation with more controls and laws".
If this story damages Quebec's and Montreal's international reputation, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh at it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken PSG to a whole new level.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players came.
Every day, I'm making progress alongside her.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements motivate me to improve my game day by day.
And with a game, it's even easier.
In football, everything happens very fast.
But I'm not going to burst into tears.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine Preparatory Training Centre to my playing days at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to put up a fight and try to do my best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of credit for my playing position.
He's being supported by co-coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course you do.
Ancelotti instills respect in all the technicians.
There is no one like him in Ligue 1 at the moment, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had a very encouraging conversation with him.
I was just recovering from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took away the leader's seat.
We're going to be in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything is possible.
But we will have our say against very good European teams.
First, we'll be first in our group in front of Porto, so we can play the second leg of the round of 16 as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financing the project to give it concrete form.
Would it be a big failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as happened last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we're really looking forward to winning this title.
Last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed that we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has scored an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from the PSG?
Considering what's been invested and the players we have, it's only natural that a lot is expected of us.
We accept that completely.
But if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and they still find something to blame us for, it's certainly a little frustrating.
You wonder what people are expecting.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to come up with a game concept.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League, we showed strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has failed to qualify for the last eight for two seasons, and that has also spent a huge amount of money!
In terms of the money invested, they thought you were 15 points ahead at halftime.
That would mean ignoring our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winners and tell ourselves that we have won it despite all the difficulties.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The more so, that one speaks of a "Zlatan addiction".
It means that Ibrahimovic is a great player and he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he's here, and he's proving that he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he's played, he's shown that he's a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their playing.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, allows everyone else to make progress as well.
How did you experience the 2012 World Cup with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
I was determined to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from making any playing time.
I saw things there that made me stronger.
Today I'm able to make good plays in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine and today we must set an example.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first months at the helm of the Blues?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages them to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal of qualifying us for the European Championships.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the draw forced on 16 October in Spain (1:1) a first leg match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I had never seen a game like this in my career.
Bitcoin allows you to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between participants.
Moreover, as is so often the case with these technologies, a political vision is at work: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange like BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or payment.
After reaching a high of $30 in June 2011, the price of bitcoin fell to $2 five months later before rebounding to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has expressed interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency, such as credits, which are used to advance in a video game, which can be earned or bought (and sometimes exchanged) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin, all nodes are simultaneously account holders, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
The difference is that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A set of data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a double-encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The content of the file also makes it possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public ledger of accounts distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done by a mathematical problem that is run on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary central banker, having the privilege of adding this extra line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clearer electronic fingerprint.
The computers take the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is hacked.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user tries to cheat by paying with the same currency twice in a very short time (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 Bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration will be cut in half periodically, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but it is divisible by one hundred millionth, which leaves some leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task increases with each improvement in computing power.
The network has had its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits have been stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol", assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company for payments with real money and using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has this defect.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind of money.
Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-closing sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who has also written a book on the currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His Paytunia system is similar to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the dealers and they do not have to install new terminals or computer programs.
All you have to do is provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards the displacement of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB's report also envisages reassessing the various risks which are now regarded as high in the event of a successful introduction of the euro.
We've pulled out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back control of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan peasants in particular by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and the disabled.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but also often farmers who refuse to accept an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will be gone as Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijar base, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees and financed by French loans, was carried out in an orderly manner.
The convoys of trucks and tanks flown in by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul after the end of 2014.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was engulfed in war because of the fighting of various rebel groups.
Their rise to power was seen as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overpowered by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war have returned to power in 2001.
They've turned into businessmen by seizing government land to sell as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, profiting from massive American subcontracting.
They have brought a bad name to themselves, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as do those who have benefited from American aid: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have been exposed to the modern world and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of both girls and boys.
We must not allow the young people to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television, with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There's an army now.
Will the authorities under whose authority it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to re-establish the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from some decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the 1964 Constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially in view of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and for a long time before that.
Industries have not been rebuilt, there are no functioning dams and major irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Private initiative will be given priority.
In a country ravaged by 30 years of war, state control of the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan had vast mineral wealth.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to take it over.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site or without transport to export it over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, let international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavate the huge Buddhist site, and remain the main employer in the province.
It will also be necessary, one day, for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' gymnasiums, the French language institute at the universities, the French language institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a civil-military action service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was disbanded in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain villages, and has commissioned a small French non-governmental organisation to try to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These works, which required a large number of local workers, helped to suppress the revolt: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after spending two billion euros on the military?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at altitudes of more than 2000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of written requests from small farming enterprises in the municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, and I am sure that the Council will make a number of proposals to the Council.
A Constitution With a Breaking Rod in Egypt
It's a new poker game from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration that temporarily grants him unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on the line.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
The President-in-Office of the Council has just given this plenary two months to complete its work.
Egypt has now relied for almost two years on a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only served to further divide the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trample the law".
Its supporters assure that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum was to be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to abandon their plan of explaining the text to the Egyptians, paragraph by paragraph.
For the president, it's also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest rages across the country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in a benevolent manner.
The European Parliament has been asked to vote on the draft constitution, and the Egyptian people have been given an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I will retain the unlimited power", which should supposedly end after the constitution is adopted.
The text was adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere by 85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent assembly.
The majority of the Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned away, feeling that they had not been able to make their views heard.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities and civil society acted in the same way.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously in most cases.
Commentators found it amusing, by the way, that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was not exactly on time.
The text, which was adopted last night, contains 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of the Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for a more strict application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a proof of their goodwill and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypophobia", say the liberals, who see it as a propaganda ploy.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is happening through other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egyptologist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are asked to comment are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy in this".
The Liberals' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is no concrete religious commitment at present.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not scholars, but academics, some of whom were trained in the French system", says Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
Reference is made here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to decide on this".
The text adopted yesterday has been strongly criticised, not only for its religious aspect, but also for the wide-ranging powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention is the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wishes, the defence budget review is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
The European Parliament has also called for the establishment of a European Union-wide system of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
The latter also express their fears about the text, which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The blasphemy offense is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article refers to the protection of women anymore, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to make a statement on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the splendor of Bible truths, modern conveniences, and unspoiled nature.
AIF gives you the top five reasons to visit Israel.
Bow before the sacred places
Visit the river Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all those who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is where Jesus performed his miracles, turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on water, calming a storm, and catching fish.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
However, most of the shrines are in Jerusalem.
Here, believers make the Way of the Cross, or the Via Dolorosa.
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, the Praetorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old City to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Mount Golgotha, where the place of the crucifixion, the anointing stone, and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to Christian belief, is the navel of the world, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands on the site where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus was made grew.
Jerusalem also contains the holiest place of the Jews - the Western Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of various faiths leave wishes behind, which are then granted.
Taking a Voyage to the Heights
The ruins of the fortress of Masada are the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 C.E.
They are situated on a rock face in the mountains, some 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else is taking a funnel to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of between 5,600 and 6,500 feet [1,600 and 2,040 m], is the famous ski resort of Hermon, which attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain, you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountain top.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited in one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum, near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in cave systems in the Judean Desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
It is home to the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bath attendants of that time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally not accepted.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem, in Tel Aviv, tells one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most moving section is the Children's Memorial, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who perished in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, it is pitch black.
The stars are twinkling.
And it's got the names of the Jewish children and the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Your Health
Israel's three main recreation areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red, and the Dead Seas.
Each of the three sites has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21°C) and the air warms to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23°C).
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe there year-round.
Incidentally, at 1,400 feet [417 m] below sea level, this unusual sea is the deepest in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water is highly salty, so that even a non-swimmer can easily swim across it.
The surrounding countryside is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural brine) and healing mud, as well as for treating skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and to calm stressed nerves.
Touching the Secrets of the Ancient World
These secrets are hidden in the old city of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, it was here that Noah built his ark, and here that Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
Fortuna shall be the legend after all who touch the walls in the alley with their star sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries at photo sessions.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theater and capture the Crusader fortress.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and operas.
List of tourist attractions
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
Instead of taking euros, travelers prefer to take dollars, which can easily be exchanged for shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
The city is mostly accessible by bus, but there is also a tram in Jerusalem, and Haifa has the only subway in the country, with six stations, connecting the upper city with the lower.
It's actually an underground cable car.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including the changeover for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transportation is suspended.
And Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
Many cafes, restaurants, and taverns serve only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without the skin, and dishes containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose from a variety of dishes including mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish hummus pasta, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Yet, there are many well-fed cats who roam the streets in comfort and with no distractions.
In the evening, they are even seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
The cost of a rental car varies from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80), depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an extra 15 dollars a day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreationists came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, representing a 51% increase compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activists debate the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading in forged certificates
Each year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families back home.
On December 1, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme has only been applied to migrants wishing to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail trade.
However, the tests are to become mandatory for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Agency.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals in this area, and it is not the Commission's intention to make any proposals.
Language proficiency must be demonstrated both for obtaining and for renewing a work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
The law also excludes persons who have obtained their educational certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The purpose, problems and protection of rights
The entire examination body will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
But before the law came into force, civil rights activists repeatedly asked the following question in the press: What does it all actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to demonstrate language proficiency bring about for both Russians and foreign workers?
The main thing, according to the spokesman of the Migration Agency, is to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers", says Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency's representation in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected even before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems faced by migrants without jobs, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who will put him in a dark, cramped barracks under the pretext of help, where he will endure with dozens of his peers for months without food and documents and toil 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our immigrants.
"You are promised this at home, and on arrival you are cheated, your passports are taken away and you don't get the promised salary", said Tolib Shwaripow, head of the main labour migration department of the Tajik Migration Agency.
Don't be like that, boss.
Nevertheless, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to earn their living in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the destination country, but also find it difficult to express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not their fault, but rather the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a decent basic education.
Because their families do not even have the money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes, and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children then seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills", they admit.
"You feel degraded and inferior".
Civil rights advocates emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
The test is only required for immigrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the migrant workers remain in Russia illegally.
"Welcome" or "No unauthorized access"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the language difficulties.
Besides, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Don't be afraid of the cost of false documents"
The day the law came into force, it was already clear that not only the migrants' registration documents could be falsified.
Some fake certificates certifying the passing of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The forged papers were printed with an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for nothing: each migrant who hoped to avoid the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs one migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both civil servants and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be bought easily.
For the time being, the authorities can only promise to give time for a basic language course to guest workers who fail the test the first time.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Home Office ignores illegal arms market
Legal weapons share in crime extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs is planning to tighten the gun laws for private gun owners.
This is the response of the authorities to the recent events of shooting at weddings and the death of seven people in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied with the Russian authorities' attempt to tackle the problems by "pulling the screws".
An open letter has been published online, in which representatives of various arms associations call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless escalations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told the BBC's Russian service.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not stop criminals from using the black market.
At present, according to the authors, in Moscow you can find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons are being smuggled through several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, says a former colonel, Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that takes orders for guns
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen both by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves", says Baranez.
On channel two, illegal weapons are being stolen from law enforcement by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen both from the police armoury and directly from law enforcement officers.
Other arms sold illegally come from military arms stores.
Explosions were common at many military camps.
"There is evidence that in some cases, the arson was done to cover up the lack of weapons", says the former military man.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers also contributed to the black market.
"Today there are countless private arms factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore sell their weapons on the black market, in Moscow, for example", the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local, sometimes artisanal, production and a mafia that organizes the smuggling", explains the former military officer.
Where did you get the guns?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Office for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of the illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all black-market weapons are "the fault of officials who have been exposed to weapons in the course of their work", says the report.
According to the researchers' data, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are stolen from the arms industry, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun store, who declined to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been discontinued because they are outdated.
He said it was more common for dealers to buy supplies from an arms depot.
A gun, such as a TT pistol, is purchased through an ensign.
The gun is being displayed and passed through the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros each with two magazines", he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and so, if they cannot follow the plan to detect crimes, they periodically conduct control purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons", adds the sales consultant.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would be waiting for me, who would take me to a certain place, where we could negotiate the price.
I didn't know the price of the gun until I was there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez is a member of the group.
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts", says the salesman. "I have a friend, but I don't trust him".
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go there and make an appointment with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets you know that the daughter lost a tooth".
I'm even getting some gossip about a friend I trust.
He's only giving me the batting rings because he knows I won't rat him out.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranez tried his hand at buying illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
The schemes have not changed, he said.
He was given a photo album with "all sorts of things" in it.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", recalls the military man.
Baranez says the buyer doesn't get the whole package, but can try everything.
So, as a potential customer, I don't just buy, I drive the seller into the woods, and we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and when I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other", the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons "for various purposes" are offered.
No papers are required, nor are there any face-to-face meetings.
"You just need the right amount of money", says the advertisement on the website "Buy a Gun or Rifle".
Users place their orders and make requests there.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", says user "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request from "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently launched a number of fake websites, and gun buyers are flocking to the agency's Web site.
People come like hungry fish to the feeding station and then they land in Siberia and they can shovel coal
Military commentator and former military man Viktor Baranez
I've heard of the following scheme: the website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The people in charge are taking orders.
The buyer transfers the money to an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon", reports Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the nonprofit organization "Pravo na oryzhie".
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can end up with nothing and go behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently launched a number of fake websites, and gun buyers are flocking to the service.
"People come like hungry fish to the feeding station and end up in a Siberian labor camp where they are allowed to shovel coal", he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
Experts estimate that the cost of buying illegal firearms can be anywhere from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", a Makarov pistol can be bought for between $100 and $300.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military armories by mid-level supervisors.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons in Russia fell by 7% to 22,9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
In the United States, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
One in four American teenagers has sat behind the counter of a McDonald's
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages at Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict yet whether the protests will continue to swell or if they will soon run out of breath.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of low-level Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests are aiming to form unions.
Until now, this sector of the economy has hardly been unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on what is known as Black Friday, when sales in the United States attracted millions of shoppers, sometimes leading to hand-to-hand fighting.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, quit their jobs and joined unions and left-wing activists in striking the chain's branches, which target low and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners to eggs and milk.
The average price of goods at Walmart stores is between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many of Walmart's low-paid employees only shop at their workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say that Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, for example, the absence of forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart employee, making $9.50 an hour, could not afford that raise, they said.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that if the company raised the average hourly wage to $12 it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they're giving out for wages now.
If Walmart were to shift the pay raises entirely onto the customers, it would only cost them 46 cents more for each purchase in the future.
That would be an additional cost to them of only $12.39 a year compared with today.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that only nine states held protests, and that the company suffered no losses.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart's cash registers accounted for nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Company spokesman Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that in total "fewer than five" Walmart employees quit their jobs and the protest action was just "another PR trick" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free money!" and so on.
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this progressive city and therefore do not exist), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you don't get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the federal and New York state minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is being raised gradually, but not too much, and on average, their low-wage employees in New York City are getting $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive town makes less than her.
How you can get by in New York with so little money is beyond me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American teenagers were behind the counter at McDonald's after school, but the teenagers were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as their main source of income or planned to stay there any longer.
Now, when I interview McDonald's employees, I always see people complaining that they're living on that salary and sometimes even having to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food chefs be paid a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits management from interfering with this goal by calling off or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, the management of the company does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high turnover of staff.
Discontented
There were also loud protests outside many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan that day.
The highlight of the protest was a rally at noon outside the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you don't get paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should all support the fast-food workers so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were present, and not all of them were employed in the fast-food industry, which employs tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain has so far been little more than a trick"
The popular subject of augmented reality among modern technology lovers is now usually viewed through the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the Interactive 3D Technologies group at Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, it became clear that the glasses were just a way station for the company's scientists.
It appeals to the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Describe briefly the research activities of your group.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely stuck to the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
But we want to look ahead five to 10 years and see the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step up, and nowadays, no Xbox is sold without the Kinect, because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What's the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to a physical level, much still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output so far not decisive.
We're trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional rendering systems based on various technologies, including projection.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
This requires that not only the user but also his environment be recognized.
Then we could supplement the real world with virtual objects much more easily.
And first of all, we should get rid of this stupid virtual reality helmet!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, since it raises questions of privacy, because one does not always want to inform everyone around one about one's actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each one in its own niche.
For example, in the area of object control in public spaces, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and concise gestures instead of inviting gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the camera but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's still relatively large, but theoretically, it could be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future is mixed controls, such as gesture and speech.
- What do you mean?
- Would you ask me to hand you this tin can, for example?
You say it and you mean it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to tell.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can't do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's about mutual closeness.
I think that in the near future we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to detect people's reactions more accurately.
For example, it could be laser sensors, because they have a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What are your requirements for modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is it lacking resolution, depth, or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a rate of 1,000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
The resolution along the X- and Y- axis must be taken into account, as well as along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of frames per second are also important.
Human movement is extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 fps is not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our lab in Redmond with an adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human-machine interaction.
For my work, I needed a device just like this, but without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently operates with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second one a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, as more computation would be required.
What would be nice is to have a flexible Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera settings to see how that helps us to get three-dimensional information about a location.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that the best prospect for the application of augmented reality technology in everyday life is the glasses?
Of course, it's not comfortable to always have a smartphone in the palm of your hand on the go, but I think the best option would be a "changing" augmented reality where we could switch from glasses to smartphones via a cloud.
The glasses are a personal gadget, and that's their strength (private is what you can see), but also their weakness, because augmented reality through glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to ordinary mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing!
What is your group's response to this objection?
In my lectures, I often talk about augmented reality being the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could very well be the integration of tactile perception.
One interesting method at the moment is the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection material.
She's a great pressure taker.
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "aerial images" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directional ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located produces a sensation that is, at the moment, as faint as if someone was blowing over the palms.
There are also wrist bands that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to outsmart the brain?
Make it think it's feeling what it's supposed to feel when it's seeing something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task with which we will have to struggle for a long time to come, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain has been moderately outsmarted, and we have many years of work ahead of us.
And that's what makes working in the field of virtual reality so compelling to a researcher: we're just getting started on a lot of things.
The taste of the culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
The selected list included already high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city's borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who you meet at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the art meeting or the art exhibition.
Wherever the paintings of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street he brings a smile to the faces of his fellow citizens and puts them in a good mood.
Recently he got a trio horn and became the St. Petersburg trio horn player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you always wear red and not yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image-maker and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray norm creates aggression and bad behavior.
I want to use my provocations to get people talking.
Every provocation I've made in the past has been an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you wanted to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Palace of Culture in Neuschwanstein, where my works were exhibited.
I knew I had to go that way.
Then the era of the old free but unofficially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were unintelligible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, representatives of Gazonevshchina; from that came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was over.
I'm drawn to the theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything except literature.
It was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture, where the best artists gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the House of the Petersburg Bohemians, until the renovation.
Many were born there: N.O.M, Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight jerseys and included the now-famous composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg hosted many shows before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origins in the Art Clinic.
That's where our staff and regulars went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a press poll for the "Personalities of our city" award.
I won in the "Artist of the Year" category, and that was the pinnacle of my career.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today's world, it's easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: You can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has a distinctive style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the timeliness and sharpness of the thoughts.
I'm having an exhibition called "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and it's scary to be that way.
In a clown, all that fades away and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let's save the world by mandating that everyone wear full-body suits.
Now everyone is paying attention to the clothes and oriented by the outside and not the inside of the person.
But maybe you shouldn't shake hands with a man, but spit in his face.
The illusion disappears through the disguise.
We recently saw you play the role of the city's horn player.
Who else would do that?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art needs to be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the breakdown of cultures.
In the past, people were in large groups: Bohemians loved the one, and commoners loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill that everybody likes.
Now you have to figure out who you're gonna like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- But Stas Mikhailov's performances are attended by several thousand!
- He's got women who've been abandoned. It's a sexual-social thing.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come instead of 10,000, so there's less management, less money, and everything goes down the drain.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to betray them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such pictures, which at a collector's house even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually don't come until the end of my career.
There are many misunderstandings these days.
It's called intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something else entirely.
I'm a man of the past, and I grew up with artists who lived and died in poverty, and who refused to accept money to paint.
That's the culture I'm advocating.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say, "Servants of culture".
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Tsars were different, because the Tsars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are good advisors in Moscow these days.
We have some in Petersburg who could be experts, but they are blocked off because we need higher-level experts to assess the former correctly and clear the way for them.
It's all about your taste now.
The same goes for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they don't accept all contemporary art and some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital; Moscow has much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
It's hard to grow art on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because for example, we have more writers than readers, and that's not right.
In Europe, many curious people go to exhibitions or concerts.
We have far fewer.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the City of St Petersburg
Born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft carrying Earthlings are off in search of a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the important question is how do we reproduce in zero gravity or on the replacement planet?
I don't think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"It is Mars and Venus", says Vladimir Surdin, a scientist at the Sternberg Institute for Astronomy.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively favorable for life, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500°C].
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The researchers first considered the question of reproduction in space from the point of view of the flora.
Half a century earlier, plants had been used in experiments.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit were no different from the Earth species.
Then came the breeding of insects, more specifically, of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, Sentinel beings were sent into space to study how zero-gravity affects the development of embryos.
A normal chick develops.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find a foothold; it must be able to stand on its feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute for Biomedical Problems RAN.
Without a firm ground, the chicks flocked wildly.
Ten hours later, the newborn babies' instincts completely died.
The chicks didn't respond to light or sound.
Four days later, they died.
"We have twice had chicks hatch and then stopped the whole thing because it is simply impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev, referring to the failed experiment with chicks in space.
The last animal-rich cage was launched into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex species will be on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized and sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was the case with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment and research needs to continue", observes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had their offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are removed from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their instinct to reproduce.
Unlike animals, humans could, in principle, do this.
Homo sapiens are capable of abstract thought and can produce a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that mankind has is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the question, will it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth after this flight?
"After all, no one answered that question", says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who had been in orbit twice and even performed work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
But there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts who, after long flights, have had a good time and have had healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even to fly into orbit", concludes cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must seek new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolab at the Cosmonaut Training Center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a state of suspended animation, the cosmonauts are gaining routine for working in open space.
Water is weightlessness.
While adults may find water pleasurable, it is a foreign environment; yet, infants find water a natural element.
It's as if the little ichthyans are witnessing the emergence of life on land from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that a child is in the amniotic fluid in the mother's belly for about nine months and the fact that it is then easier to get used to water.
In principle, this makes sense, since it takes only two weeks from birth to the first swim.
"It's too short a time to forget", says Marina Aksenova, a baby swimming instructor.
So while for a newborn child weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman cannot do without gravity.
In the weightless state, the abdominal and pelvic muscles contract at a tremendous rate, and so does the ability to push the child out.
All right, let's get around this by birth-control.
For example, the delivery could take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question posed by Valeri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's gravity, the body cannot form the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn baby can't be put into a straitjacket in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance to his life.
"This experiment we are undertaking together, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will result in the birth of a handicapped person, a person who is completely unadapted", predicts Igor Pestow, head of the bioethics committee of the RAN Institute for Biomedical Problems.
So far, the birth of children in space is a theory.
But it will come true when the inhabitants of Earth set off in their spaceships to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born offspring.
NKÚ chief: control of the black system failed by political fault
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in relation to public procurement, but falls behind in their application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ), told Aktuálně.cz.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - and I don't think that's the case with us", Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be obtained by a joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas towards the so-called "Schwarz System".
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then the head of government cannot just come and obstruct the control authority, whose duty is to check compliance with the law", Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a joint Czech-German project which compared the laws of both countries on public procurement.
What was that about?
This is a parallel study that we started about two years ago.
In short, it is about European legislation defining how public contracts are to be handled, on which national legislation builds, and then there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all these and although the examination is not yet complete, we have been able to note very interesting differences. In general terms, the laws in our country are perhaps even a little more "strict and perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules, but that the actual application of the law must also be addressed.
How can the project help you?What will you gain from this project?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect the laws and to lower and eliminate thresholds when this does not seem to have a very positive effect.
Economics means buying something at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and avoiding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will reach this target.
Perhaps it is even true that we are only burdening the system with excessive paperwork in this way, and those who seek out loopholes in the system have a much easier time exploiting the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech law on gifting.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an agency like our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
The German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a board, but it is formed somewhat differently.
The powers are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. these courts of account also exist in the individual federal states - this is where the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds that correspond to our state funds.
Public funds administered by the counties and municipalities are subject to the control of the county courts of audit.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would be reluctant to compare this in general without specifics. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, but it certainly cannot be said that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the auditors are better there?
I'm not sure, but as I said, I don't like comparisons like that.
It is also worth noting that the countries that are our role models also have problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything to do with our agency, would they?
As far as the Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance of the amendment to the Act on the Granting of Grants to your authority? Have you already felt any effects?
Given that this amendment has only been in force for a short time, it has not yet had any effect on our examinations.
Since our checks are carried out after the event, we must expect some delay.
The Commission has also proposed to the Council that the European Parliament and the Council should be consulted on the drafting of the new directive on the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment.
Do you see the passage of this bill as a positive development, or is it just another bureaucratic burden on the system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise when the rules become "strict" and cannot be followed.
Under the previous rules, persons subject to an audit are already accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) insofar as any failure to comply with the law on the granting of aid amounts to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don't think it's that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system would only increase the pressure on the bureaucracy.
Where's the way out of here?
Let us first say which path is not the right one.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the Black system now forbidden or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of government cannot simply come and obstruct the Control Board, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow the thing", but he can't say that we'll pretend like it's nothing.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the bidder with the best offer is excluded simply because of a formal error.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think we are lacking.
The roads are occasionally icy, but mostly dry.
The roads in the Czech Republic are partly snow and ice-covered.
However, most of the roads are easily accessible, and sometimes extreme caution is required.
Other
In the district of Karlsbad, the roads were easily passable this morning, there were only a few snow and ice deposits.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 degrees Celsius, and it should get a little warmer during the day.
The region is now free of snow, and in the lower elevations only a thin blanket of snow remains.
However, on the ridges of the Erzgebirge there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, the fog had reduced visibility.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully navigable.
However, attention should be paid to bridges, for example, where the roadways are sometimes icy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, these roads are still covered by partially frozen or driven snow.
This is why increased attention is needed, especially at higher altitudes.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
Some roads in eastern Bohemia are dangerous because of ice sheets, and in the mountains and higher areas there is still a layer of snow on the roads, the Highways and Motorways Directorate reports on its website.
The road championships warn drivers of ice floes, which can occur especially at higher altitudes in the Pardubice district.
The glacier can occur on second and third class roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The I/43 and I/34 roads near Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly common on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
A layer of snow is located in high altitudes on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia, the weather is mostly sunny or clear, and there is little rainfall.
Temperatures range from minus 3 to plus 1 degrees Celsius, and the wind is weak.
District of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen district are now well navigable, but local attention is needed and the driving is adapted to the weather.
This one is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it snowed earlier and the temperature dropped later, ice may fall on the roads.
Fog is also expected locally, although visibility will improve as the day progresses.
These figures are taken from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is virtually free to all traffic, but road championships recommend increased attention between kilometres 80 and 131.
The first-class roads are mostly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the Pilsen and Tachov districts, ice floes may occur in sections.
The second and third class roadways are wet, and therefore the indication of possible sections of road is also applicable.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Böhmerwald area.
District of Olomouc
Drivers heading for the high ground in the Olomouc district may be expected to experience snow today.
After the use of the scattering vehicles, the snowmobile remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
The night snow removal forced the road construction workers to use, in the district of Šumperk fell according to the road administration about 3 cm of new snow.
In the rest of the district, the roads are mostly open to traffic.
"In the Šumperk district, snow remains in the highlands.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, drivers heading towards Jeseník have to expect snow", an employee of the Šumperk Road Administration told the ČTK Agency today.
Her colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to go out at night, as they say the roads are clean and wet, even up to the high altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully passable, but in the Šternberk district, drivers must drive carefully in forested areas, as the roadways are still damp.
The following municipalities are also included in the area:
In Northern Bohemia, the road authorities report several badly passable sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí region is closed, according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero even in lower altitudes, so that snow and ice will hold onto the roads. On the other hand, no problems have been reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Alps, and the roads are usually dry.
So far, there's been no reports of traffic disruption.
Ice is reported in particular from the area around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the nighttime conditions were ideal - rain and melting snow by day, clear skies and frost by night.
The main routes and the I/13 road on the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec report poor traffic conditions.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be blocked because of the branches that were pushed onto the road by the snow load.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about the fact that the end of the world is coming in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster messages that we humans love to jump on.
Our band, the Tap Tap, we make fun of this and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you'll also be performing a unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain the project to our readers?
It's a nationwide benefit that we've been planning for two years.
We want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is predicted to end on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava, starting at 9 p.m.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time the Mayan calendar ends in the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
I think it was me who originally came up with the idea, and then we worked on it with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
We not only want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will hand this world over to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key chains against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing them at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap band also recorded the anti-apocalyptic anthem "World's End" with other artists.
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube, but will it be played at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, assuming that everything works out and the end of the world doesn't happen...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live on Czech television.
The lyrics of the anthem are by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people intensively in our projects.
And it turns out that most of them are interested in working with us, and they enjoy it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the anti-doom concerts?
For the creation of the open educational centre Studeo, which we have been working on for six years together with the Tap association at the Jedlička Institute.
The pupils of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by tutors who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
The Jedlička Institute will be completed and will have its own building, which we will then move into with this project.
Each concert features several bands and performers.
What criteria did you use to select these?
We wanted to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý are performing.
For further information, please refer to the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, and for this concert too we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA by then - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans for abroad are not small, you've already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
But The Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, meaning that the wheelchairs have to be moved in the luggage compartment, and we have to carry a lot of tool cases and other luggage, of course...
Nevertheless, it has always worked out without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were not long ago, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of what it is like in the different countries with accessibility, how people with disabilities are treated there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything is working better than here, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is not handicapped at all, and it is still unusual for a person in a wheelchair to be alone in the city centre.
It is not even a matter of course that a wheelchair user is presented in an elevator, for example.
Fortunately, associations are also being set up to try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things we are lagging behind...
It should be noted, however, that improvement in the situation will always depend on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move independently in public spaces, to go to museums, to use toilets, etc.
But it is not very common that a larger group of disabled people actively participate in social events, in that we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for public space and accessibility are one thing, but it's only when we have great athletes, artists, actors, politicians, lawyers in our ranks that things will really start to change.
So far these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap is very popular right now, but if we go back a few years, what was it that motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and play the saxophone among other things, I have founded a music company with a colleague.
Well, with time, as our host, Láďa Angelovič, used to say, something gets out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that working with well-known singers helped us; we also began actively promoting ourselves.
We have come to realize that if you do something and it's not visible from the outside, your performance is, in a sense, non-existent.
The EU funds also allow us to afford good editors, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get The Tap Tap to this point?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do things differently.
In show business today, people often copy each other.
This is logical in its own way, since anything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are few things that are truly unique, and I dare say tap tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; that's only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned creatures to be pitied.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, it's not just for them, but for the whole of society.
Did your being a strict boss, as many people are told, help you succeed?
To do something well, you must not compromise on many things and you must also be disciplined.
I think that is quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to go through preparation phases, and spend a lot of time on concert tours, their enthusiasm quickly fades.
But that's how it works everywhere, in any band that's serious about working and achieving.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, since 1998?
There is only one, Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Anyone who wants to join is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9:00 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected to each other via a live link at the end, and a joint interpretation of the anthem "Weltuntergang fällt aus" by the band The Tap Tap will be heard.
The concert aims to raise funds for the equipping of a multifunctional educational centre for the disabled, to be built under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
Admission is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old are free, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the ESA's member states, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, becoming the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which joined on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish space enthusiasts were already interested in space travel, although they did not always find it understandable.
I am reminded, for example, of the lecture given by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, however, and years later Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, which was donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis' globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was recognized by, among other things, naming one of the craters on the Earth-facing side of the Moon after him.
Already in 1925, a railway drainage line was built in Poland, for which a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to launch or to slow the draisines.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-propelled shells.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents submitted show that the research had reached the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 the specialist press published the design of a photoelectric fighter rocket by Ing. Rohoziński, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity its work was terminated by the outbreak of war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society is in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, which has four extensive articles on space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space society.
At that time, the first satellite projects were already in place, and it was clear that space exploration would have a future.
From its very beginning in 1956, the Polish Space Society PTA sought to join the International Space Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became deputy chairman of the International Space Federation.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been heavily involved in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, with the first launch on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, with a maximum flight altitude of 1,800 meters, was about 80 centimeters long and weighed less than 5 kilograms.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight testing began in the Błędów Desert with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should reach a flight altitude of up to 14,5 km and be used for observing high winds.
However, in 1962 the development was stopped.
The successor of the first RM missile was the Meteor-1 missile, developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), differing from each other in the size of the transport compartment for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a carrier with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight altitude of all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aeronautics, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of approximately 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Interkosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on non-profit work.
This decision has generated a lively public debate.
It would be interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent state of conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
The large differences in the value of labour (wages) give rise to price tensions.
The term 'competitive' means a situation in which the producer, by importing cheap goods, seeks to compete in the market by 'under-selling' the competition in order to gain a larger market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means that most companies either move their production abroad, or buy cheaply, or go out of business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is aggravated by the absolute unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay their taxes and thereby to compensate for the economic and social damage caused by them to society as a whole.
This is a well-known situation, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies where governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are handing over their own population to private capital without regard for the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in changes to existing legislation.
The aim of these measures is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic constraints in the case of longterm unemployment and on the other by the curtailing of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-widening gaps between the rich and the poor.
In Germany, for some years now, there have been public food distribution centres for the poor who are no longer able to earn a living by their own labour.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As the German economy becomes more competitive, there are regular cases where workers receive such low wages that the state has to raise their income to the subsistence level.
A similar scandal was uncovered in the case of staff working in the German Bundestag.
The austerity policies of practically all southern EU countries will undoubtedly lead to the same situation, where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or to work for a minimum wage on the margins of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
The question naturally arises: Where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, it is simply poverty that migrates from one country to another; or capital is not even there, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa in general, workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This is true of all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to excess that the state cannot participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is narrow-minded in its insistence that the state must not intervene in the economy.
Then we must ask ourselves whether private capital is not influencing or even directing politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the unambiguous answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual favouritism, legislation where practically everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, for lack of funds, entrusts the drafting of bills to private legal firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then passed by the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer emanates from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from powerful financial groups who put their own interests above all others.
Clearly, liberal democracies are now quickly entering a situation similar to that described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic under Caesars and Pompey: "The state had long since been in decay, and offices were seized by force.
By bribery, by unlawful taking of advantage, or by stone and sword.
Corruption was rampant, and the people went to the polls with already bought votes"... "...people of character did not run for office, so that the state, as a result of this decline, had no consul for eight months"... "It was really beginning to be said that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a monarchy, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompey, but the strong man was then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with the monarchy.
As it turns out, today's society, like that of the ancients, is founded on the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature incapable of recognising and enforcing the benefit to society as a whole.
The result, then as now, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who do not even try to make any deep reforms.
The rise of fascism and communism, therefore, has its roots in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The fall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, as the next round is already looming.
The fact that today's elites are faced with the possible future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and modern history, is particularly catastrophic.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
The Czech Republic is faced with the prospect of a new economic crisis, and the Czech Republic is facing a new economic crisis.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: the lab of chaos.
"...that nothing comes from violence, or ever will come from violence", Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is, "...so that we don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no war", says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a myriad of reactions.
The first is that the Palestinians are not the only ones who are being attacked by the Israeli government, and that the Israeli government is not the only one who is attacking the Palestinians.
I do not want to write here about who is the perpetrator and who is the victim in these repeated waves of killing; after all, the people of Israel today, including the self-governing areas, were born into the current political situation and did not witness the beginning of the violence themselves.
I am trying to give readers a look behind the scenes, a look at who the 95 years of tension (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in that little patch of land in the Middle East have served in the first place.
My thoughts are based in part on available historical facts, in part on derived from them, and in part on my own understanding of who or what group of people is influencing the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every age, we can recognize an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We have to recognize that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes with it did not come about within the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out in particular, which could be called the head of the octopus (I don't know if there is anyone above them, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about her.
Understandably so.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 1890s to stop their name being associated with high-profile crimes, which were always based on consolidating their power, increasing their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world's central banks, and they are waging wars or preparing to wage wars against countries where they are not involved in central banks (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there are only four, with Russia meanwhile having subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to stand up to this family had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (i.e., government) banknotes during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression in 1929.
The Rothschilds' global power lust led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars in the years 1859-1871 by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break Britain's colonial rule, and the third war was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and luxuries and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the prelude) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families, with the Rothschilds at the top, works is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to the aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the FED, so that crises like the one they caused in 1907 do not recur).
After succeeding in starting World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsar's Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire, war was no longer necessary), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the Second World War, the bankers used politics to create a latent conflict situation by imposing gigantic war reparations on Germany; thereby they created the conditions for impoverished masses, so that they had to cheer the Germans only with a sufficiently strong leader who named the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take on the function of a fifth column and also took steps to defuse the flame of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, possibly in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (Return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, mentioned earlier, created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chains that the international bankers had initially held him to, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to assess, but in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948 and, just as war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel is the creation of the flashpoint for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be the victim on the front line, as in the Second World War, this time along with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only domestically but also internationally (just think how sharply people divide themselves into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, where individual greed and the quest for global power have been at the origin?
We must distinguish between the people of Israel and their leaders, for the international bankers in Israel, as well as in the rest of us, the people, are voting exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-minded politician loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything to ignite a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict, and in which Iran's control over the two-mile-wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil supplies pass, could lead to the destruction of the world economy.
How well these words of David Rockefeller in 1994 are put to use: "All we need is a global crisis, and people will embrace the new world order".
In their minds, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where a chip is implanted in every newborn at birth to bring this entity under total control.
"And it causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one may buy or sell except he that has the mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast and its number by itself.
For it is the number of a man, and its number is six hundred and sixty-six".
The movie Argo: When the worst comes to the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamic students occupied the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
In exchange for their release, they demanded the extradition of deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the US after the revolution, which had for decades patronized his regime.
There was no positive way out for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure of the violent attempt to free the hostages only made matters worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The Iranian debacle was a major contributor to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode in this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications at the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get the refugees out of Iran, using an extravagant story to conceal their true identities - they were travelling with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew supposedly visiting the country to shoot a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To give credibility to the cover-up, articles about this film project were published in professional journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time, but the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time it is also a so-called "caper movie", i.e. the story of a successful husaren piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood of the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, in the corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable career comeback with this film.
A mocked-up actor has become a respected director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the Krimi Kein Kinderspiel (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller Stadt ohne Gnade (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film not set in the director's native Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that set the previous films of this director apart from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are set in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that actually took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity, and yet conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also achieve a similar effect with fictional scenes (the fake film crew at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes making a little contribution to reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a telephone call in America, or the pursuit on the runway, seem a little artificial).
Argo's weakness is its over-scattering, caused by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are charming in their roles as Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space, and they are far from alone in this film.
Affleck's film loses some of its appeal, but it is one that can be watched with interest, enjoying its design and its retro style, reminiscent of a thriller from the 1970s.
But he is hard to get excited about.
But it is enough to remind us of a piece of history that is still alive today, and to show how far-fetched the notions of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence agencies are.
Guidelines for balloon inflation, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually publishes a survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided to hold the contest "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop" this year.
"This is the idea behind the recent EU plan to introduce a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies", Patrik Nacher, who is in charge of the organisation of the survey, told the Právo newspaper.
The absurdities mentioned include, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they represented a lower risk to insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
The EU's controversial regulations include the mandatory mixing of bioethanol with fuels, which is harmful to nature, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of the dangerous substance, and the directive on the size of chicken cows, which has made eggs much more expensive this year.
The ban on the use of the term 'butter spray' and the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs have also been criticised in the past.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often takes decisions under pressure from one or other business and industrial lobby, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member states (the Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks by using the threat of veto).
Lobby interests also pushed for bananas of the highest commercial grade in the EU to be at least 14 cm long and not to have a 'curvature anomaly'.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that they merely harmonise the disparate national standards that would impede trade.
The EU has already softened its standards for fruit and vegetables in the face of opposition from some countries, saying that the existing guidelines would lead to food waste.
A possible candidate to win this poll is last year's EU regulation requiring balloons to be marked with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU cited an American study which found that air balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation in children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to the age of 14 when using marketed fruit.
Curious thoughts can happen at home
It is also relatively absurd to have a directive which concerns European officials themselves - anyone in an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated the EU Regulation on the size of food stocks on the territory of a member state, in addition to the previous absurdities.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the volume of mushrooms in cans, for which we were threatened with a heavy fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having any sea, or by the idea of giving subsidies to applications for subsidies.
These ideas, of course, did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU for reimbursement", declared the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), in autumn 2004.
He argued that the cereal harvest had been very high and that the state stocks were overstocked as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to sea ports, Palas says the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally went so far as to invite the Czech Republic to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries with no access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered municipalities funding for grant applications, specifically for the establishment of grant applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to promote the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more credit.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding of projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced upon us by individual Member States in the budget negotiations.
The Czech Republic is also experiencing a crisis of emotions in this country, as is the case in other EU countries, where the Czech Republic is fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products, and is not always winning the fight.
Although after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name 'Olomoucké tvarůžky' for domestic rum (Tuzemský rum), which has a tradition dating back to the 19th century, our producers had to change the name to 'Tuzemák'.
The term 'rum' may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
The official list of products registered in the EU now includes the world-famous Feta and Gorgonzola cheeses, the Lübeck Marzipan or Parma cheese, the Karlsbader Zwieback, the Pohořelice and Třeboň carp, and the Sauer Hopfen.
The Pardubice leaf cake or the Hořicer rolls can boast an EU trademark.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur", Okamura claims.
Senator, how does one come up with the idea of running for the office of president?
I'm not interested in being a senator or a president.
If everything worked out in our country, I wouldn't run for office.
But I can't stand to see the Republic being plundered for 20 years, with thieves running free, while people are being taxed and their retirement ages raised.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I try to suggest a solution to change it.
And since I'm over 40 and independent and nonpartisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then you went straight to the castle.
Doesn't that turn your back on your constituents?
I told myself all along that I would fight for the castle after the Senate election results.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for the office of president if I was elected senator.
But my goal is not the function, the function is a tool with which I can realize my visions.
To do that, I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
The difficulty is not only that we, as a people, are cursing in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we are crushing anyone who wants to change things.
The media, which wants to rob you of your honor, confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was accused of bribing journalists or being an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have started the battle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million crowns.
You have to change the laws.
As president, you have no authority to do so, and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a citizen, I have fought for the guide to remain a free trade, and this has been achieved.
The problem is the narrow-minded policy - when someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only holds the population back.
As an independent loser, I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from any party what is best for our country without any kind of box thinking or party dogma.
As a person, do you see yourself more on the right or the left in politics?
From a Czech perspective, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care whether someone is on the left or the right; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like it when people call you a populist.
But don't you see that in what you just said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to get close to.
It is a question of the European Parliament's ability to make a decision on the basis of the European Parliament's own initiative.
But without the support of Parliament, you're just a buzzword.
And that won't get you very far in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you'll be able to enforce, say, material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other choice.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to push these goals.
As President, I would have no problem with calling on the heads of the parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine in law the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And the respondents would then have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality that points out wrongdoing can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, which was a result of public pressure.
I am a very amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I've only just started in politics and I'm trying to get the majority to support my program.
I always try to judge things for myself; and if it doesn't work, then I go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little like Okamura is trying to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a lifeguard.
I know that I'm not going to achieve anything on my own, so I've talked to several prominent people about whether they want to run for the Senate as well.
I spoke to Radim Jančura, for example, but he refused because of work overload.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy on the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not so sure.
Sixty percent of the eligible voters did not go to the polls at all, and those who did went to the polls mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
That leaves us two independents in the Senate.
The people have chosen a Senate composition that will be very difficult to change.
I will nevertheless fight for my visions, for example, for the direct election of mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about forming your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to check the background of every potential party member, and I don't have the money to do so.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; there is only CZK 20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about wealth statements, what about yours?
I estimate my personal wealth at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another worth 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about 1 million.
The Aston Martin was a childhood dream, by the way - I've always liked James Bond, the way he drove the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of $60 million, and you don't have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program doesn't seem to be getting much attention.
And I'm not obligated to fund the campaign from my own funds.
The campaign expenses are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on a senator's salary alone, so I could not, for example, pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So you're going to stay in business to make ends meet?
Didn't you say you were going to curtail these activities?
But that's not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I've been partially reducing my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the travel agent's manager in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to make a living.
What was your monthly income as an entrepreneur?
Between 200 and 400 thousand, and it's still going.
But as president, I would cease all my activities.
The full interview is published in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I think the building is funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a bystander on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says, "It's a nice house, though".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
They all have the Internet, iPads, e-books.
No one volunteers to go into one of those old-style libraries anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town just outside the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The municipality of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this absurd situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges on the euro banknotes as beautifully painted concrete-steel miniatures.
The success of the education campaign was limited.
And so the town fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of the crazy-ass beam diagrams and producer of witty, often cynical, buildings, took the matter with his usual composure and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury was still looking around in a daze and shaking their armpits, the cheeky Maas stacked his exquisite contribution of greatness into a pyramid and ended his actionist-based speech with the words, "Dear city!"
So this is it, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called book mountain!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is uncovered.
It is part of a revitalization project which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjoining apartment and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This makes the faceless little town cake, which until now had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one might be tempted to think of a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: booked Eldorado under the cheese bells.
Although there is an elevator that runs through the middle of the mountain, the true joys of space and reading are found when the topography is climbed on foot.
The round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt-out clinker floor and the elegant street lamps speak unmistakably the language of a public town square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
Already, people are looking for a park bench, a dog, and boys and girls playing soccer.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"The bookshelves are usually located along the front, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and built the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and building technology center.
A special delight is the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall paneling, sometimes armor, sometimes stairwells.
The look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even the most experienced architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the thought of unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the Standard.
And so one day in a farm in Friesland we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a thin plastic sheet of one millimetre has been used in greenhouses and in fields as a root support.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin fabric lasts a season or two, then it's ready for the rubbish bin.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in such quantities - into plates four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called landbouwplastic (KLP) turns a dark, homogeneous, resilient material that smells like a new car and a sports shoe.
After 105 steps, you've reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long trek, the Literature Café offers not only a fantastic view of the city but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is an example of ecological design, despite the many glass surfaces", says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain is covered with a glass roof, on sunny days the sun shines only briefly into the interior.
The wide wooden clay walls, which are set across the glass facade, serve as shade and absorb much of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic roller skates.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, was already venturing into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
The aim is to fill the gaps in the library's 70,000 volumes, which are still not fully stocked.
The concept worked.
The shelves are filled to the brim.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that now, thanks to our invitation, "every resident has a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that their book is part of this building.
And if it's only for show.
In doing so, MVRDV has achieved the royal discipline that is known in the jargon as identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
Young and uneducated as she may be.
This is a starting point for identity.
Szabo: 'Germans must play a greater role'
Germany abstained from voting on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic footing.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin refused.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libyan uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that's right.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was managed by the United States, so to speak, to a German foreign policy.
The European Union has a long history of developing a common foreign policy.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to understand their role, but they are moving towards a more 'normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy like they have in France or Britain.
What does a 'normal' foreign policy mean in German terms?
It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests which are independent of those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the attitude towards the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
So we must be careful not to offend the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
It definitely matters.
But I wouldn't want to put too much weight on it either, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding for the German position.
That is why I do not think that this was a break as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect.
It is a signal that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted to veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think that the Obama administration has a pretty good understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot take this position publicly.
I think that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not that enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things from their own position.
That is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are aware that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany even want to take on a leading role?
Or is Germany still finding it difficult to lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany takes on a larger role, a variety of anti-German feelings are released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That's the old problem, you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be responsive to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and that's not easy.
The US is losing its influence in European politics, but the EU is not filling the vacuum. Who else is going to do it?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant for them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and so is Ralph Polo Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a name which is officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Yet, it is protected as long as the original owners of the name do not sue.
And even then, it's not clear that they're right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
For the copycatters, a few extra letters are enough to register their marks.
So Gucci becomes just Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you have Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations from the Beijing Trademark Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, a name of art that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are the world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-story department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, in the case of Mr Pattloch, on behalf of his clients, he has decided that Chinese companies will be granted the right to use a name which is already protected elsewhere by the Trademark Office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a brand of passenger side.
The word is "Bang Dakuan".
That's women who are attracted to rich men.
Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is bad for business, and it must be fought", demands Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusivity disappears, the damage to the image is enormous".
The financial losses and the legal costs of the industries affected run into the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trade mark register are difficult to achieve and cost money.
The proceedings can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court dismissed claims because the name in question had become "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he would even have to pay the plagiarist for infringing his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
So to this day, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion designer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO trade mark office in Beijing admits that there were shortages in 2010 due to insufficient staff and premises.
The report also highlights the need to develop a more comprehensive approach to the problem of the environment.
The number of unresolved appeals, for example, fell by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
However, the Office still has 81,500 objections pending.
It 's a lot to take on .
As is often the case in China, the numbers are staggering.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive time, the authority said.
This was also the case for the stock of all valid trade marks, totalling 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were collected.
Simply put, each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
The cost of doing so is many times higher, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of imitation automobile parts out of the way.
However, the copycat retained the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
The German authorities have failed to do so because family names cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO rejected the objection of the Munich authorities.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be careful as hell .
Now the matter is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will be brought to a successful conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely laborious and takes up a lot of our time, money and nerve".
The internal costs were hard to quantify, the company archives had to go through even a hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-figure euro fee" to settle the case, but in vain.
"That shows how much it's worth to us", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten to spill over into Europe.
That is, when copycats secure unprotected brands.
A Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg name for shoes and leather in Germany.
The group had abandoned this business area long ago, but it was still able to avoid registration.
"You have to be very careful", says Wentzler.
Both he and his lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather, as Wentzler says, foreigners should "declare everything that is somehow worthy of protection in China as well".
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg fails in the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the other side royalties for one's own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be forced out of the market in the segment in question.
Welfare Day: Stamping, singing and helping
In Heidelberg, the choir rehearses the Imbongi, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted.
The story of a connection that stretches far beyond the 8733 kilometers.
First, there's the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, pumps for women and slippers for men search the parquet floor for the beat, find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - to oppress, seduce and pursue one another.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his cloth shoes when he combines them with his smooth wild gestures.
It's Monday night, and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
The 50 singers have come, ranging in age from 23 to 69, from human geneticist to housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text, and this text is in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are some 34 million people living with HIV, according to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 people in Swaziland who are living with AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them are in secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on a sponsorship.
She guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and a hot meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi is Zulu for storyteller or praiser.
No one in this room can speak the Bantu language fluently but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign, soft language, occasionally bringing them back to where they originated: southern Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers by air from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Some 2,000 people live there, some in simple mud and straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents to HIV.
In small, what is happening in Eswatini is happening in small, in Eswatini: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
Male foreskin circumcisions, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are not widely accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and dying by the mid-thirties is not uncommon.
On a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a high school diploma, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to provide him with a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since been almost professionally caring for the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea.
Common viral STIs include HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Fleas and ticks are parasitic STIs.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all reported cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candida, tripe and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - yet, they account for around 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In this country, human papillomavirus is also common among adolescents.
How have the numbers of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are compulsory.
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate an STD?
The infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urinary discomfort, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because some STDs can also be transmitted through contact with the skin and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular checkups, especially for those who change sex partners frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and delayed outcomes avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the songs that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"We have already sent around €200,000 to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well-off, perhaps with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the Zulu call the old women, are the pillars of the village.
Some of these have taken in up to 14 orphans, provided them with a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children in uniform show up for school on time each day.
Those who have no one else will be taken to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has established a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has organized an HIV test for many in the village.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, it is best kept quiet.
A King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sex".
Strange, in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his extravagant lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This government-sanctioned life-form is one reason why HIV has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who are carrying the virus across the country.
Free condoms are available on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh".
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels through southern Africa every two to three years, singing songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - such recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also brought some tears to some grim border guards.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although the small village is hard to find on maps, it is well known in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light", the people there say.
And if you go back the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the thumping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you see it also shining there.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The MESSENGER probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is said to be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has detected the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The MESSENGER spacecraft has found evidence of an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
It is said to be at least 12 inches [30 cm] thick and possibly up to 20 feet [20 m] thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one has yet linked the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the MESSENGER spacecraft, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earthlings, probes, telescopes and tiny robots like the Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, tiny peepholes into the vastness.
This image is from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union definition.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are visible as blue dots, the pink "newborns" in the starry ring room are harder to identify.
This star-forming region - unflatteringly called W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This glowing glow of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer space telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is made of material that the star ejected in the dying process.
In the vast Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye at night.
But with the telescope, the colors come out more clearly.
Like a red Age, the helix nebula is looking towards the viewer in this infrared photo.
It's located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this nebula the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photography provides the spectacular coloring.
This baby star was not seen in its full glory until the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: How they came into being is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturnian moon that vanished without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most vivid images taken by the Hubble Telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name trifide comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-split, three-column), as dark dust stripes three-part the glowing heart of the star-birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the precursors of a cosmic cataclysm in the constellation of Serpens: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are rushing toward each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
For those who do not understand technical abbreviations, she is known as the Southern Fire Wheel.
This Hubble Space Telescope image shows a section of the iris nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula, we find the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The crib of stars is always producing new youngsters.
This star cloud, too, combined with the Rosetta Nebula, is constantly producing new baby stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly radiating galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was predominantly made up of hydrogen.
Our Sight into Space - The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for stargazing a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown larger and larger - and the insights they provide deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, in this picture, averaged five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows for a simultaneous view of the universe through two mirrors, each measuring 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 33 feet [10 m] in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save money.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 35 feet [11 m].
The disadvantage of the low-cost design is that the telescope is fixed in its vertical angle - limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an angle of elevation.
Its peculiarity is its high light-gathering power.
This is because, despite its comparatively small diameter, it is close to the world's largest mirror telescope.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to space for signals from extraterrestrials.
The radio telescope is 1,000 feet in diameter.
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is a project in which anyone with a computer can help by donating computing power.
View of the observatory of the European Space Agency (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here's the Very Large Telescope - living up to its name.
With its four mirrors in total, the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO's Chilean observatory.
Its main mirror is to be a whopping 42 meters long - and to be assembled from nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
But pictures are not expected until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each averaging ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also uses the Subaru Telescope and IRTTF to look at the sky.
Also on Mauna Kea is a new, huge telescope - with a mirror diameter of 100 feet [30 m].
Here's an illustration of it.
But the most important images of space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that it had identified 1235 planet candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This image shows the final preparations for launch by the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket no earlier than 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that ice may also exist at the south pole of Mercury.
But there's no reliable data on that because the Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and live to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical old age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical old age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The drive through the Talish Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus trudges along the winding road, passing thickly wooded hills, raging rivers, and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys, about whom little is known, except that they speak perfect Persian as well as Azerbaijani and are very long-lived.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town boasts of Soviet-era architecture that is too old-fashioned to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists rarely come here, and it is too difficult to travel from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
The 200-mile [200 km] trip takes eight hours because the road is single-track.
The country's fabulous wealth, derived from its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet reached this province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and next year we will have a festival of the world's oldest people here", Fatulayeva says.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only museum in the world.
Here are the lives of about eight dozen Talys from the area, documented as being older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he lived to be 120 years old.
At the age of 136 still a child conceived
But the museum's controversial star is the sheepherder Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have lived to be 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And considering that the oldest documented person lived to 122 years of age, Muslumov's age is highly questionable.
"He was born in the region in 1805, and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So, did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate his age by a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher on ageing at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Germany, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also surprisingly many very old people in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "and in Sardinia too there are an extremely large number of very old men".
However, due to the lack of documentation, there was no scientific proof of age, especially since there were no social registers.
Every day, a few spoons of melted butter.
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik have a remarkable rate of reaching a Biblical age.
At present, there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why are there so many elderly people living here in the South?
The Assyrian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes it's the diet.
But the fact that the very high-calorie diet of the people of Talisker, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, is supposed to be so healthy does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view.
In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
Two toddlers are jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, served in the typical armadu-shaped glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf she hides long, dark-blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it never ran out and kept its color.
"I never used shampoo either", Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She only ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never once in my life bought groceries at the grocery store.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the period after World War II.
But things got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange coming from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult of the father of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's elderly.
The amount of the pension is 230 Manat (about the same amount in Euro), which Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, a sum that can be used to live well in local conditions.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-dead son is right: "Our culture respects the elderly".
They live in the midst of the extended family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution, based on Sharia, is hotly contested.
The Egyptian president spared no expense to Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secularists.
Because they are all, so far, hopelessly divided in confused opposition, afraid.
Fear of a God-state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are not aware of, the world is not fully aware of.
Should the judicial power be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles that were voted on by the 100-member Constituent Assembly, dominated by Islamists, in a night-long 15-hour parliamentary session, are somewhat worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the judiciary is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what is "principles"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least that's what a newly added article suggests: In all matters concerning Sharia, the country's most important Islamic institution, Al-Ashar University, which has a great influence on Sunni Islam, must be taken into account.
This need not be, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto result in the dismissal of the judiciary.
Many aspects of the draft constitution are a matter of interpretation
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'customs' in the context of the directive.
These courts were used during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention.
The state should also, the draft says, "protect the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values".
This is so legally vague that state institutions could use this article to control the content of film art and literature.
In plain English, that means censorship.
The Commission's proposal is to be implemented by the end of the year.
Yet another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his apostles.
But what constitutes an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording of the prohibition on "insulting people" is equally dubious.
Is it enough to make a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
The European Parliament has already expressed its concern about the situation in the Middle East, and has called for the release of the hostages.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been building for weeks against the Islamist overwhelming power.
Tens of thousands gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night in an unusual unison, vowing to overturn the charter before it can take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, the third-place candidate in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution belongs "to the trash heap of history".
He accused Morsi's supporters of attempting a "coup against democracy" via the Twitter messaging service.
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said opposition politician Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated", the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they would not monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organised Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, counter-demonstrated, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafi supporters joined in, shouting: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They demanded of Morsi, "Clean the land!" and insisted, "The Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have probably provoked civil warlike conditions.
Morsi's followers clearly did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now was the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamist draft is considered certain.
"The word human rights is not even mentioned"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or facing trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their worldview, but because he sees human rights as indivisible.
For this, he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution", he laments in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three branches of the state caused the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto putting it out of action", Saeda laments.
But without civil society organisations, a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels left out, even by the international community, which views the ideological leadership struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be retaliation.
One protester on Tahrir warned: "You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control".
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the world's most foul-smelling fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but in the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for rather foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You put them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sports clothes.
And leave them there for a week.
That's about how you imagine the nose-snatching smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, there's spectacular scenery, and there's this persistent smell in the air that just won't go away.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you want your fish to be.
When darkness falls in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this, well, really very enchanting specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department but also organizes the festival as the so-called "Rakfisk-General".
All around us, people are eating small fish cubes and consuming large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk", says Havard.
The alcohol can mask the smell.
I'll take some bites.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk close to your nose, it's not bad - like sushi, which has a rather long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration facilities and fish were watered in airtight salt-water vessels in autumn.
In the depths of winter, after a long fermentation, it was then removed and consumed - no doubt with the help of alcohol-saturated senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare system.
Even Sweden, the old rival, which not long ago was far richer than Norway, is now flooded with immigrants.
Rakfisk is considered to be important - an essential, if rigorous, part of Norwegian history.
It's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a whopping 10 euros.
Norway doesn't make it into the world press very often, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here, they still hate to mention Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who last year shot 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it refers only to the "July 22 incident".
Norwegians struggle to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murder.
The main reason for Norway's current wealth is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says Anna, our waitress, who serves round tablets of ripe rakfisk and, with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes, embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are a people, as they say, of prudence.
Your English is as impeccable as most people here.
We're not very proud, we don't like bragging.
Norway has been very careful in its management of its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, when everyone was throwing money around that they didn't own, Norway kept its purse tightly locked.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rakfisk", she adds with a light-hearted laugh.
I'm standing in the snow, lining up for another course - I've had enough of rakfisk.
I'm sure a moose burger is something else, but the juicy meat makes me want to eat it.
But at night, the stink fish is back on the menu.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of several that organize a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish to smell.
There's a live TV feed to a showmaster dressed as a fly, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
The spectacle is like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You clap and you laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overcome by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the severe fog of all the fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start to his campaign
As Mexico's next president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
On a good day, this is a city that is always congested, but on Monday, a ring of steel was erected, blocking several important traffic routes into the capital and causing chaos on the streets.
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential oath and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has proven to be a good economic powerhouse, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence", Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will help us achieve that goal.
Before he went toe-to-toe with the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions are divided about the new head of state.
A straight man
For example, he is fondly remembered in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city, you can take one of the highways that Pena Nieto built, which is a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
His name is also on a plaque outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to bring real and lasting change", said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who serves as a congressman for Pena Nietos's party, the PRI.
In particular, in terms of security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition's accusations that the new president lacks substance.
He's a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is a great statesman, but above all he is a good listener.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo is stark.
Hidden beneath highway overpasses, the town is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In a wasteland near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the past two years alone.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that surpasses even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
Pena Nieto's critics say that he has not addressed the problem of women's murders in an appropriate way during his time in office.
But in the worst case, his government has turned a blind eye to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the neighborhood in decay, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of events is that Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it was as if her body had been washed", recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the rigor mortis had already set in.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall, next to a cross bearing the single word: justice.
But this is precisely the family that has been denied her until now.
The authorities treated me like a chatterbox, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want you to just accept their judgment and shut up.
"But that's not possible when there are so many mistakes and omissions", she says.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and Parliament.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term in office.
"I hope that as president he is the same as he was as governor", said PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But it is precisely this that the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
The prosecution claims that Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment
Prosecutors deny that Bradley Manning was mistreated in prison.
The hearing will focus on Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the charges for harsh prison conditions.
The US Army corporal is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
Prosecutors on Friday sought to establish that Army Corporal Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest disclosure of classified information in U.S. history, missed several opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he allegedly suffered while in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month incarceration in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request by the defence to dismiss the charges - Manning had already been punished sufficiently by the harsh prison term - Manning had testified that he had contemplated suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst who was arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
And then it was published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officials filled out after their meetings with Manning during his incarceration at Quantico Military Prison, where he was held from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced conditions.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When questioned by Fein about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, did not contain any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers had questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them, but that they had not been logged.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) 'No problem' and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all", Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to have his observer status downgraded to 'prevention of injury'.
The military said it had given him this restrictive status - one level below the risk of suicide - for his own protection and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince staff that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status for injury prevention (...) to achieve what I saw as a higher quality of life", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday that he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison at Quantico Naval Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness because of the heat.
Not knowing what was happening to him or to the outside world was stressful.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, to this cage together", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
He was allowed only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light coming from outside his cell.
If he turned around at night and the guards could not see his face, he was awakened to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning about an allegation he made in his testimony Thursday - that he had slept naked in his cell at Quantico for a night and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he never had the opportunity to wrap himself in his blanket during this count.
At Friday's interrogation, Manning said he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket that he could have covered himself with, but admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, and that he had tried to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer he could have used the waist of his underpants or his flip-flops to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experience and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted at his court-martial, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser charges, while other counts deemed too extreme will be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to justify the terms of the detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the regulations that apply to all inmates held in Quantico under the highest security measures.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally posting classified intelligence on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If found guilty on all counts, he faces life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities, he said.
Mexicans tend to blame expats - they remind them of hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport control, when a feeling of helplessness set in.
Signs pointed to two lines: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicanos"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which one to go to.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
An ethnic acronym - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
Later, I decided to go with Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for any shredding or dyeing.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to speak it at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I got in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when the future Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues that you would expect to see when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans are just as likely to stay in Mexico these days instead of emigrating to the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc along the lines of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, though he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never give a single thought to the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership at gunpoint to give up more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries rather than minutes, memories of this event are hard to miss.
So whenever a U.S. government official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - complaints about how the Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma are on the warpath.
And yet Mexico's biggest challenge is really in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
You want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason that so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, a person -- maybe a parent or a grandparent -- didn't have a chance in Mexico and migrated north.
And in most cases, this person fit a profile -- dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, and so on.
We are the descendants of those people, and our allegiance is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now be living the American dream, having gone to good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living -- not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurred at times, but not so with regard to our loyalty.
This is clearly the case in the United States.
We are also aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we're not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't be trapped behind the silk curtain, living a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are -- and Mexican Americans resent that.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they don't belong to one country or the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
You're enjoying the best of both worlds, but you're not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we're seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexicans.
As I was to learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and sections of the educated citizenry want to resume their ties with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
I mean, I'm not.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And with the unequal distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that this is a great country.
I'm afraid you're going to have to go through this alone, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for its treatment of Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge against the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
I know.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The recent bloody events seem to have stifled such hope.
In the midst of the usual blame-sharing, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have struck near Israel's capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there is reason to believe that the deadly stalemate may finally be coming to an end.
A War That Can Be Neither Lost Nor Won
At first glance, optimism seems to be far from justified in the light of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st is holding, this week's fighting has strengthened the hard-liners on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, claim to have pushed back the Israelis, despite the fact that their group suffered heavy losses.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the cramming of Gaza's 1.7 million inhabitants into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders might conclude that time is on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and wealthy friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah holds power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may be threatening to topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on Israel's southern flank has altered the balance of the region for the long term.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is allied with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor which even Israel and the United States cannot push out.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
Hamas is no longer a threat from a military standpoint.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has proved itself and many of Hamas's missiles have been destroyed.
For a while at least, Israel will be able to sleep more soundly.
The United States is firmly in its diplomatic position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least because of the barricades that have been built into the West Bank, and thus into the core of a possible Palestinian state, to protect Jewish settlements that have been declared illegal under international law but are still being built.
Netanyahu is in good shape, his Likud party has joined forces with an even more militant group under Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 elections.
Why spoil these backstabbing Palestinians and leave them with a state of their own?
If they were in control of the West Bank, would they not fire rockets at it, as their counterparts in Gaza do?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
The hardliners may be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could be a blow to them.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the problems in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will do little to help the new Arab governments rebuild their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Morsi is joining forces with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will no doubt one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly exact their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need an outside push
The correct answer is the one that is represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states to which Israel cedes territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence in enforcing this solution.
Egypt must now join Turkey and Qatar in stopping the flow of arms to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by a territorial swap and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arab nations outside should also try to persuade Hamas and Fatah to come to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also do his part to bring Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems he's equally averse to involvement.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packages, identical for all tobacco brands
Australia has enacted the world's first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, and drastically changing the way in which infant and child health issues are portrayed, with sick body parts and children exposed to cigarette smoke.
Aside from the different health warnings and pictures, as of next Saturday, the only difference between the packages will be the brand names printed in identical, small print.
Australia is introducing the world's strictest regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government is trying to discourage young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government's position is based on studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking at the age of 26 are 99% likely to stop smoking at the age of 26.
"You can see that even young children understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image", says Tanya Plibersek, the German Minister of Health, citing studies that show, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
The laws, it was said, would encourage the black market, leading to cheaper and more readily available cigarettes.
"The laws will have serious unintended consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will be selling far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette butts and silicone caps to cover the unpalatable packaging has increased enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the laws in the High Court of Australia two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and is waiting for new stock.
It's a good deal for us.
Experts say the problem is the popularity of social media among the very population targeted by the plan.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from advertising on television, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop selling cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned online advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no control over international sites.
"A tobacco marketer with only a small area left to advertise their products will not be able to avoid the Internet", says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in testimonials about brands written by "just normal people".
One has to ask: Is this just a private individual who enjoys Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even makes a video for it - or is a marketing agency involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws rather than marketing them.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unjust trade restrictions, even though none of the countries have more trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has been in talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to require photographic warnings.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a cigarette butt and put the box away", says Victor El Hage, buying a cigarette pack with a picture of a tumor in the mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacco shop in Sydney's inner city, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult for him to fill his shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort a shipment, now it takes me four", says Yu.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes altogether - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing up", he adds visibly indignant.
In a world of constant electrification, it's nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane broke down due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had plenty of time to do some boring thinking.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are pointing to boredom as a positive.
If they are, it is okay for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us are staring at a screen or two almost all the time these days, we no longer get the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
- I know.
And it's not.
I shall come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with the increase of leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), does not see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history", he says.
The walls of Pompeii are adorned with Latin graffiti about boredom, dating back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After extensive reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom is defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfying activity but not being able to do it".
Boredom is different from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be.
Apathy, on the other hand, is the absence of the urge to act.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disturbance of the attentional process coupled with a bad mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can sound almost as depressing.
But Professor Eastwood believes that while these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or in the world, whereas depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the next room that had nothing to do with the content; others heard it at a low volume, so that it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who listened to the barely audible television said they felt more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, couldn't find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or strenuous task, the distraction can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you are engaged in a monotonous activity - "such as looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt - music can be a distraction and help to keep you from feeling bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that grimacing and scratching, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can actually combat boredom by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to limp around learn and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at one time or another - my delayed flight, a loudspeaker that's been ringing, a particularly tiresome movie.
But some people are more easily bored than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "boring susceptibility scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as "Many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to be bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tight-knit bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he paged nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
It found that 32 percent of adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, compared to 23 percent who said they were bored when they weren't in school.
However, only 3 percent of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know if the percentages have gone up or down in terms of boredom.
But he is sure that "youth are perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their daily lives.
So, back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes it doesn't, because in extreme cases, it leads people to take extreme physical risks and resort to gambling or drugs to alleviate them, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors have studied the relationship between boredom and creativity, including Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the topic for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best at a given moment.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you'll be happy.
But while TV may provide feelings of happiness in the short run, these fade away in the long run.
So if you hand a bored child an iPad, it may help to relieve boredom, but it has not taught him to be entertained or to control himself, says Professor Fenske.
He adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to talk but also gains self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
We should not be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable outside the constant rush of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with me.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, unrelenting desire to do something meaningful", he says.
He thinks that people are really just looking for a way to shut down and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to stay engaged once the noise is silenced".
Colorado has no clear policy on the new marijuana law
19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in the state: possession of a few marijuana sticks and a pipe with which to smoke them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving the car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - offenses punishable by a $100 fine each - and was given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals", Orozco said.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug offenses is less about the law than it is about the location.
Hundreds of marijuana-related regulatory violations are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which has passed similar measures.
Police authorities will no longer prosecute adults over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally permitted once the new laws come into effect in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative counties of Colorado have announced they will continue to prosecute existing marijuana offenses and still bring people to trial.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to stop new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next", says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state are scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug, with a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, having legalized the drug first for medical use and then for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is a good place to look", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow", he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6th, and it also marks the end of a gray area where the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalized.
And awkward practical issues need to be addressed during this time - such as how to reconcile the state's requirement for "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis businesses within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially the Seattle metropolitan area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his Aurora staff stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offenses in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not seek criminal charges for these offenses "from now on".
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce city regulations to regulate medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a more extreme view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to get consumers to quit.
Currently, 119 individuals are facing trial for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other offenses.
"Our agency has a duty to pursue violations that were criminal at the time of the crime", Buck said in a statement.
Reactions are mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer charging adults with possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending property lawsuits.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes", he says.
Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions across the state have fostered a deep-seated division among local officials over the big green experiment.
District prosecutors face a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants in marijuana trials and is a spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for this that they still cannot accept legalization", he believes.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national model cases for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials prepare for an era of legal sale, they are also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government to continue criminalizing the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level.
Proponents of the legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will relent.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana users and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while law enforcement officials are unlikely to break in to seize smaller amounts of the drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to tolerate the legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal government to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, even though they may not open for another year or so.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban that is expected to be passed next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we're licensing somebody and then we're facing a big problem at the federal level", said city councilman Bob Nicholson.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are guided by what the community has decided and not by what the state has decided.
There are still many questions to be answered.
I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only today's college students are attacked for their beliefs
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended what I once considered the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of entering Worcester College in the late 1980s - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags and created the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow soldiers having sex in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson slyly explained that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from broken cups.
The truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I was, because I was suffering from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been harassed for one reason only - a reason that seemed even more narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same equal rights protections that benefit gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) at Corpus Christi College report that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared unwanted" because of their political views.
They are demanding a seat on their college's Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was made worse by a recent documentary on student politics on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It featured, among others, graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative Oxford University Student Union, riding in a Rolls-Royce, sporting a silver suit and silver-lined walkways.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being viewed as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the conservative student union at Nottingham University, told a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing trend to the left in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever meeting us".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the call for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, the president-elect of the conservative Oxford student union, says she has seen a growing hostility from JCR members towards students of the moderate right.
"This is a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members", she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was one of those minorities.
I arrived in September 1986 as an incredibly shy 18-year-old.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
The previous year, the university had voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even frightened Stalinists.
In the first few days of the first semester week, when new students were getting to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what was to come.
I found that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but actually enjoyed participating in it.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatisation and the government's rejection of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
My first assignment was to translate 18th-century French texts into English, and I wasn't prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor, Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I tripped.
Pitt was a little man with a face like pie, and pretty nasty.
"Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
Tears welled up in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your free time - so long as you're not too busy with your social activities", Pitt grumbled at me.
I went back to my room with a hanging head.
That night, I was sitting alone at the college having dinner when someone lightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English sophomore named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Union.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory will be tortured.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be Labour supporters.
Later, I tried to disguise myself in a local pub.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick was to prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically had attended what was considered a conservative Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and filthy.
"How do Tories have sex?" someone asked me.
They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford?
Would I be able to meet like-minded ones after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay ahead of me stretched before my mind's eye into a purgatory of abstinence and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-determinist perspective on history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here", he told me.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents' house, finding refuge with more open-minded friends and family in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I hated it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said in a low voice.
They would never do that, not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my Communist friends always exhibited impeccable manners.
His wet eyes became cloudy.
Give it a try.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory, had succumbed to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, when another history teacher had seriously claimed that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly sizzling with shame, I admitted that my parents had brainwashed me, calling them "old jerks".
The relief was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a whiny, lazy cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and malevolence.
And even more tragically, it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought to this day.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the "Valentino - Master of Couture" exhibition opening in London this week, ABC is speaking to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective that has assembled more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says in his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino was always fascinated by the distant and sticky world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3, there is a wealth of private letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from modest fashion designer in the northern Italian town of Voghera to international jet-set idol.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick their balls on your beautiful carpet, like some beautiful pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted to be invited to his house in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, who is close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also remembers the fashion designer's charisma.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His influence was felt in every detail of his apartment, the decor, the food, and the music.
"Everyone felt important and loved", recalls the "top model", who began her career at the 1995 Paris Haute Couture Week.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art", she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
Garavani's life is not a story of madness, but of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 200-foot-long runway that suggests a role-play: the user takes the model's place and walks down the runway to admire a fantastic "audience" wearing masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg are shining.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
A lot of these customers say that the first Valentine's Day is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a "Gillette" jacket and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection of 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and highlight the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion influencer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally being old enough and having the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
Then, in the late 1990's, it finally came.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a neckline that lives up to its name.
"It was a dream come true", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is not a fashion addict, his obsession is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg preserves her evening gowns from the couturier "with the utmost care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress worn by Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of labor and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were needed to make this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery patterns, and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the foremost authority on the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the late 20th century haute couture, "the return to the clientele of high society".
After years of being tainted by the elite's savoir-être, Valentino is now their best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calm, his well-groomed and perfect appearance", D'Arenberg admits.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace on him".
And this is from a princess...
The world's most difficult job: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others who work in literal hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the eastern part of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to descend each day to the bottom of his crater, where sulfur-containing gases from the ground solidify in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the steep stone paths.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2,386 meters, the exhausted climbers take more than 40 minutes to ascend at turtle-like speed, keeping their balance and pacing carefully so as not to slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost them their life, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Once at the top, they make their way through the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales set up by a mining company a little further down at an altitude of 1850 metres
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the volcano's resources since 1960 and (never mind) its workers, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life, and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"We normally carry 70 kg [60 lb] each way, so we get about 46,000 rupees [$2,500] each way", explains Anto, who normally does three trips a day.
It takes him three hours to complete each journey, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (£7.500) to his name.
What may seem like a miserable wage for such a sheerly inhuman effort is actually three times what he would earn from field work.
"The daily wage for the miners here, where the coffee harvest is 15,000 rupees (£1.50) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (£13) is very high", explains the bearer, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
He earned 75,000 rupees a day, and the work was not that hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, frequent coughs and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life for three years at Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left its first traces on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, frequent coughs and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in more than just plain English.
This young man, who is friendly and intelligent but has been punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead he is doing the work of a porter.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and gets up at two in the morning because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color glows blue in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters are loading baskets of sulfur on their shoulders at the bottom of the crater.
Despite its high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not supply any equipment to the operators, who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera fee that the park's guards charge tourists for taking pictures of the volcano and the human remains, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance fee.
"This work is for animals, not for people", protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old, stocky porter who has worked at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and itches the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and traps the miners in the thick pillars rising from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains of serious illnesses ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, is no longer able to carry 50kg.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks over a goat track between the bushes to the camp at Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life", Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
The eldest of his five children, now in his 30s, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty continues generation after generation in one of the world's toughest jobs: that of those who work as human burden on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame their lack of children on their careers, stress, and the cost of housing and child rearing.
"Singapore's population must grow".
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let's fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of a commercial for mint candy, but nevertheless -- or perhaps because of this -- they became a viral YouTube video in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics are part of a rapper song, the local proverb, such as "Shutting a bao (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising company, which made the video, is hoping that the commercial will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their "national duty".
This is something that's only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst breeders in the world, so we realized this was a problem we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as marketing pheromone perfume or organizing speed-dating evenings.
It's possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they didn't necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, like writing a rap song?
Children
The Singapore government is not taking this issue lightly.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on policy to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all have been little success so far.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more babies?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Administration, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a lot more options in terms of life goals and priorities, besides getting married and starting a family", she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and the delay in marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counteract the shrinking population has led to resentment among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore that show a thinly veiled xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore last year scored its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem by increasing contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates have the known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policy, the Singapore example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make sure that not so many small apartments are built.
It is already having an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that are allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and are showing a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they may promote the lifestyle of the single and that they may discourage construction companies from building large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger housing units.
They're so popular, and the units sell out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give clearer guidance to developers who previously faced obstacles when they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, discussions with Singaporeans working in the financial district suggest that they will not have much effect.
"People are under a lot of stress, and housing and education are expensive, so many people are putting it off", says one young manager.
The kids can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time", says another man in his 20's.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of ownership and education as reasons for not having children.
That's why Singaporeans have the final say in having children - there's so much the government can do.

According to the dictionary, this is the private property or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any interference".
What's private for someone under 16?
How does this definition apply to his daily life and to social networks?
Does he understand the dangers of sharing online situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five teenagers between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, they linked the term to "something very personal" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when applying it to social networks.
"I wouldn't reveal my deepest secrets in a post", says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very private secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world", he affirms.
I'll post some pretty pictures or pictures of games on FB.
I also spend time with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't of me or someone who's making a fool of himself", he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos of nudity, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 friends on Facebook and 9 followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I joined Twitter to express myself and to write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just upload them", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can quickly talk to distant relatives or friends", he says.
When asked, he replies that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone recommended a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and in Ask, he admits not knowing 20 of the people he's added to his friends list.
"I'm not scared because we have something in common, like music", he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked for his address or telephone number.
"If someone harasses me or asks me to do it, I just remove them from my account", he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with the experience now known as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was", he assures me.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He was just doing it privately".
It then explains a series of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of people he knew in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, that's what I'd do if I didn't like him or if I wanted to punch him in the face.
"But I know that this is cyberbullying", he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was born as a medium for finding information, but the emergence of these sites has changed the rules of the game", she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in education from Yale University and is the author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants", coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are those children and adolescents who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach, when we are still learning", he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue "because we require them to have a defined criteria for what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where the maturity is not sufficient for this".
"They should also be choosy if what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking of the consequences", he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work", he says.
Porras then goes on to list some of the possibilities: There are some things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to have a picture of you posted, like the one you posted about a friend?
Do you know what the others are posting about you?
Did you ask the other people's permission before you tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone have to know what you're doing at any given moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Anyone who is not online acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must be true for social networks", he explains.
Monitoring and surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, elementary school teacher, and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read the social network policies carefully.
Understanding all the paragraphs will give you a solid foundation for discussing with your children the importance of having a Web-based account.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish", he explains.
According to Guardia, the children need to be reminded of the lesson "You must not talk to strangers".
The conclusion of the Unasur summit without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima declaration, which had been announced earlier and which was supposed to be signed by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to obtain access to the document signed at the VI Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially said that they would hand it over after the closure, but then stated that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government at some point.
When asked about the text, they said that the contents were explained by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, the only image of the President's meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few pieces of information that circulated among journalists were obtained by the spokesmen of some of the governments of Unasur present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused unease among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who demanded more information.
After that, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the summit's "concluding statement", but it was Humala's statement and not the official document concluding the summit.
The third summit of the Arab States of South America (ASPA) was held in Peru last October, and on this occasion too, despite press calls, the so-called Lima declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published.
The official ASPA website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court of Justice that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICC, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the trial initiated by Lima v. Santiago, to hear the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and implement the judgment on the differences that we are presently submitting to this international court", Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, makes agreements and submits to international courts", Piñera added, saluting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered a grave error, had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 following the ousting of its president, Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host, President Ollanta Humala, opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The President read out the final document, in which he announced that 16 decisions had been taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries had been defined, with a total investment of $17 billion.
The EU's newly elected president, Mr Ban Ki-moon, said that the EU was "a step forward in the process of achieving the goal of South American citizenship, and we are extending the decisions on residence rights".
He said that measures were being taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America, and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not be a triumph, but a means to increase our production capacity and to show our peoples a better future", added Humala.
"We have decided to prioritize a series of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas...thereby uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms", the Peruvian president said in a statement read out.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft directive on the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment against pollution from industrial sources.
The final document also dealt with the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-admission to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace, with good neighbourly relations, was another aspect emphasised at the Summit.
In this context, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he began his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico on Saturday, in order to deal respectfully with the maritime conflict following a ruling by the ICJ that was challenged by Bogotá.
"I may meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)", said Santos.
'We will examine all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary,' he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will handle this matter as civilized and respectful as possible", added Santos.
Santos and Ortega are to meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
The EU's defence ministers met in advance of the summit to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru will hold the rotating presidency of the regional bloc.
'South America must learn from the integration of its citizens', says Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually having something to learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed each other in the Second World War and other conflicts" and "today they are practically a fatherland".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that would promote the member states of Unasur.
"Free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking account of those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is financed by the United States", he said, referring to Ecuador's granting political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles, but followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there was "well-founded suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his case would not be respected".
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to be interrogated on his own territory for an alleged sexual offence, whereas "Swedish law allows this by means of a videoconference, which could have been carried out through the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa stated that there was a danger that Assange's health and mental state would be compromised.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a small problem with his lungs, but it is not serious", said the Ecuadorian head of state.
However, there is a risk of physical and psychological harm because he is confined in a confined space and cannot exercise outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every person", he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London was to grant him a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings in various European bodies", he explained.
And if Britain grants this discharge tomorrow, I think that's done.
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish law allows and as has been done in other cases, the problem would be solved.
Correa used the occasion to assert himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the malice and the lies that undermine free speech".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek profit and blackmail", he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador would no longer be ruled by such journalists "nor by the bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries", and anticipated that if reelected, he would "deepen the revolution to continue in this right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must remain tough and not allow any opportunism and no coup d'état disguised as legal" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay".
The Ecuadorian President also considered his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, 'absolutely justified' in his desire to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American state and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked at in the future.
He also hoped for a successful resolution of the maritime boundary disputes between Peru and Chile before the same court, and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies if both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very harsh".
Regarding the possibility of running for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive term, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 elections, he would retire from political life.
I have never been interested in power, but in conditions of such injustice as Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to live up to that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it will be my last term as president, after which I will retire from public life.
This is true even if we lose.
"It is decided", he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's health problems in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he had gone there for a scheduled, routine treatment and that he was expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any way mean a decline in President Chávez's health", he commented.
The Ecuadorian President took part in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima today, which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
AIDS is now a cause of death that is too late to be recognized
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed as HIV positive.
"It was like a bomb went off", he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to "deaden" without apparent success.
He kept it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness himself and began to learn about it, and he did so with such dedication that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which he joined after several struggles in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmas.
Even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying good-bye "because it was a dead end".
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with a good quality of life.
However, many people who are still coming to the clinic are unaware of their illness and have already been damaged by the virus and have exhausted their immune systems, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after AIDS first appeared in the world, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same", said the head of the HCG's HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, adding that this information was backed up by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that scientists since 2008 concluded that while AIDS is not a death sentence, that the years of survival and the quality of life depend on the degree of the immune system impairment of the people at the beginning of the treatment, and that those who are not drug dependent have the greatest chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above means that in this sense, a 25-year-old who is diagnosed as HIV-positive "can easily live to 75 years of age, as long as he is under control", said the expert.
To put this progress in perspective, it is important to remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even though mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNUNAIDS Annual Report), it is still true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 people died in May this year, but the state has been assured that universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been available since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and this is our hospital.
The problem is that people come in at a very advanced stage because they don't know their infection status, which is very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us with a concomitant infection, and to influence the global mortality rate, earlier diagnosis is needed, so that all those who need it are offered a massive range of screening tests".
This proposal is supported by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) and by patients like Fabrizio, who had his test done in a private laboratory, and only because it was done by a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS stage and even had Kaposi sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the common complications.
It's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear it.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather explode three times", they say in my case.
The change was for the better, I eat well, I exercise and I take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person", says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage those who are afraid today, on World AIDS Day.
They should get tested if they are at risk, and the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter.
There are big gaps between the health programs and the average citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
At the designated sites, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased; they used to give them out individually, now they give us packages of a hundred, which is fine, but there are still people who don't have access to a condom", he said.
Young people are at risk of new infections.
"What do you need it for?" is a common question of derision from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy and health-care workers, who do not want young people to be exposed, the correspondent assured.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution be reoriented, with condoms not only being placed behind the counter but also in dispensers in public toilets in facilities frequented by young people.
It is not to promote promiscuity.
They are not to be paid for beer and motel, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not like that; the best thing to do is to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity", he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of which are AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks fourth nationally in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV.
92% of cases are sexually transmitted, 6% are bloodborne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, because for every registered case, there are four or five people who don't know it.
The United States Court of Appeals upheld a judgment not recognising the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was reached through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, and this sets an ominous precedent for any national company with a subsidiary in a neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So, it could be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that Mexican laws allow are not valid in the Land of the Stars and Stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of the ruling by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bancarrotas District Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies helplessly exposed to the confiscation of their property across the Rio Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court on three grounds of inconsistency.
While the judge in the main proceedings points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, with its seat in New Orleans, first of all states that the case in the main proceedings is that of the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a transnational profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute acting as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies after the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate that the Vitro branches had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities to group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions).
It is also true that, after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who brought legal proceedings against Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the VCFs such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, did not obtain a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which hit the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family opposes the decision of the Court of Appeal, which is the same court, so that the vote is taken by the full court, that is, by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not done, the Cerciorare challenge is filed, which requires the review of the case by a higher authority, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The gravity of this case is that the Court left out a document sent by the Mexican Government under the Figura Amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) describing the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Commercial Competitions Act, and which points out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
It is also noted that the country has subscribed to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band carnival: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General government
After months of complaints by Mexican aviation unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Pilot's Union Association) has finally made progress.
The petition cited by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accusing it of obstructing justice.
The supervisory authority then systematically refused to inform the central government of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw 198 million pesos from the escrow account F/589 of Bank IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used to acquire shares in the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded.
At a weekend meeting at a Caribbean University forum, a group of national and international environmentalists, academics, business people and members of civil society in general decided to form a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
The Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has succeeded in uniting the governors of the south-east to oppose the monumental institution which has destroyed some protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has not complied with a request from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been filed according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken despite the fact that the Senate had dismissed the possibility because it considered them a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the construction company Homex is putting over 500 million pesos in stock certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical issues promising an interest payment every 28 days.
The creation of Competitive
A group of companies, called Competival, was formed by the leading information technology companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, whose objective is the service market of the software cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world-famous basketball player, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been involved in the sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much of a mental collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of the sport for 6 years, whether as a lower class player, player of the first national league, official and director in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"I've put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 90s", Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and bear witness to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player to 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or general manager of the club.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most, because I was able to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 whether as manager, co-manager or coach.
There were many rewarding years, including five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy made his debut on BSN.
From then on, Cuco Ortiz took over, and he was a very good administrator", says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, telling me, "I have a very strong player, six feet tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of our best pitchers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had made it possible for Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would have made it possible for him to win another.
The Vaqueros' championship with Gausse was awarded to him, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At the time, he preferred to enjoy his and Mincy's executions on the national team.
I remember the first time we won against the United States in the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
The European Parliament has also been asked to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to asbestos at work.
Was that 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, like the one who beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team from the Pan American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and gave the U.S. team a fight, like when they won bronze against us in the World Championships.
That team included not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not play in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín.
And this is without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question to ask.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. They were all very good.
Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you've accomplished in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which in the early 90s brought the BSN up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
Like the boys in Ponce playing in their own territory and not meeting teams from other corners of the island until the national playoffs.
Kids are traveling a lot and playing games.
At least I see the results of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch old-time music videos on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, scheming and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of 1980s greed, is dead.
He lived to be 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family news release to The Associated Press from Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he was once again playing the iconic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebration.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'm gonna miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Charming Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There, he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Genie" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS television drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their surroundings aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shot J.R.?" ad, which was supposed to create anticipation for an emotional episode where Hagmann's character was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered at bookmakers.
The series set a record for the number of viewers at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1990 episode, it was watched by an average of 41 million viewers, making "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had got her pregnant and threatened to expose her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but others had reasons to want him dead, too.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and unfaithful husband who struggled to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) admitted.
"I know what to write on J.R.'s gravestone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should read, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers around the world, and he will remain in our hearts, for those of us who have had the good fortune to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success on the television channel TNT a few months ago.
Filming on five episodes of the second season was complete, and a sixth episode was being shot, the network said.
There was no immediate comment from Warner or TNT on how the loss of Hagmann would be handled in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who performed classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she had Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't write anything that I thought would hurt or hurt anyone in any way", he told the Associated Press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became a liver donor and volunteered at a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I advise them, encourage them, meet with them before and after their operations", he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable at first, but you'll be fine".
He also became an anti-smoking campaigner and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the Course Studying the "End of the World"
Each week, the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible catch: the end of the Mayan "long countdown" on December 21, which many believed to mean the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what was to await him in the next two months: the devastating Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If one analysed what has happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And it's a reminder that bad is good for those with apocalyptic mindsets.
And he's not the only professor who's teaching classes on the end of the world this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history.
At Temple, visiting professor Barry Vacker is teaching a course on "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time", he said, as well as the ways in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed apocalyptic movies and how they compared to real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probable, plausible and impossible", said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to offer a course simply titled "The End of the World".
"We're not taking 2012 so we always have the option of holding the course again in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent doom", students must study, write projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to "work until the night the world supposedly ends", Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no seats left", Restall said of his high-A student class, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the semester started, we received emails from students asking if there were any openings.
The students themselves assure us that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers' Camden School of Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really just a matter of consolation or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a class that teaches this", he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student - and certainly no professor - said that he believed in the December 21 deadline.
"Our first project was on Mayan prophecy, and in a way we are discrediting them", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final year student at Temple from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that goes back several centuries, when people reacted to changes in their environment with predictions of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"Other places don't think like that", he says.
This is particularly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he knows of a course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines will not participate in the end of the world", he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days of the Last Judgment were spoken of, saying that if nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately thought of a new date" or philosophized that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
