Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear they may be confused with the Muppets
Some National Assembly members are dismayed by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to 'Welsh Parliament'.
Members of the National Assembly of all political stripes fear being the target of the spotlight.
A Labour Party MP said his group was concerned that the name  rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp stands for doof and pwp for Aa.
A member of the National Assembly for Plaid Cymru said the whole group was 'not happy' and had suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the strong similarity between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on names for members of the National Assembly is of course up to the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed widespread support for the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
As regards the titles of National Assembly Members, the panel preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, while in a public hearing the option MWP received the most support.
The National Assembly members seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle for consensus could pose a problem for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft bill within weeks.
The Law on Reforms will contain further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of National Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote definitively on their behalf during their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was called to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with a similar name, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that it has a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly spoken out against its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
 Today, neither exists anymore.
He said the bars disappearing was understandable.
"People's social life is different today", he said.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly gather.
He fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as church leaders expect, and that they will "sooner or later" be back on top.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by people who do not support the remaining shelters.
"The overwhelming majority of people buying condos in these buildings will be white", he said, "which will accelerate the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people moving into these condos will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
A black congregation that held its services nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they commissioned the bell.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bells "the bells of the poor".
The expert who sounded the bell in July used different words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell, played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been happening in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story involving architects and contractors, who were brought in part by the lay leaders of the church and partly by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish head - the lay leadership body of the parish - expressed written concerns to the diocese in July that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the parish head, even though he was not involved in commissioning the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old in California while diving for lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of lobster season, a shark reportedly attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and paddled with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
When Hammel arrived at the boy's home, he found that his entire clavicle had been torn open.
I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: There is a shark in the water!, added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Life swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but had been determined to be a non-hazardous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Officials have shut down the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles says that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's is attacking with department store-like cosmetics departments staffed by specialized assistants, boots, super-drugs and Debenhams.
As part of a major push to tap the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow while fashion and home goods sales are falling, the larger cosmetics departments will be trialled in 11 branches nationwide, and if successful will be expanded to additional branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the supermarkets' search for ways to reuse store space previously used for televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's says its cosmetics range doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also, existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series will get more space and branded sections similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its 'Boutique' make-up range, so that most of its products are vegan-friendly, an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing in two Sainsbury's branches, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets have to do more to encourage customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has established hundreds of Argos outlets in its stores and a number of Habitat outlets since it bought the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, and this has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganise its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the drugstore retailer's stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as advisors.
Our range of brands is tailored to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient location make us an attractive destination for cosmetics shoppers, who are challenging the way they shop.
Peter Jones furious after Holly Willoughby 's withdrawal from a £ 11 million deal
Dragon star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby backed out of a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons" Den star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand venture to focus on her own new follow-on contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was reportedly 'furious' when the 'Golden Girl' of television admitted at a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that she could no longer devote enough time to the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly because of her new business deals worth up to £1.5 million.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and would have likely doubled Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his vacation homes.
A source said Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It should ensure their long-term future for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all concerned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch.
At the Marlow headquarters, there's a warehouse full of goods waiting to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is one of Britain's most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in launching.
Moreover, it could spell the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are spending the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business dealings".
Harsh words and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and for such positive comments about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news anchorman:
I've given up nothing.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
The negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled, however.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North saw no "appropriate response" to the US's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the US was sticking to sanctions designed to keep the pressure up.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rallying speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea", he said.
We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: the end of missile testing, support for the release of hostages and the repatriation of the remains of American servicemen.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake devastated an island in Indonesia, claiming hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so that is a bit difficult", said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work there.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu based on whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in the relief efforts.
With the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly dealing with, the country is still woefully unprepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters have been established in Aceh, they are not commonplace on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning that went into effect, is likely to have contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge at best.
Natural disasters complicate the logistics.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's crippled infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, spending large sums of money on roads and railways.
But the government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from funding shortfalls.
Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes and apartments as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has scored a deep-throwing equaliser against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a goal in the 89th minute from a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge was 1-0 down, and was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri, who was about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the back post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I was just trying to get myself in that position and get the ball, players like Shaq are always playing as much forward as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time for myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I had a contact with the ball, and I didn't think too much about it and I just took the shot.
Chelsea took the lead after a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard at half-time with 1: 0.
The Blues forward returned a pass with the heel to Mateo, then turned near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in midfield.
He then threw a good pass that put Hazard in the penalty box.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed with a left-handed shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker past the back of the net.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face each other in the UEFA Europa League video game on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people are believed to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which triggered waves up to six meters high, said government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was strewn with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents to report any sightings or reports of anything suspicious.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would ask anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with a dashcam, to contact us, as they may have information that is of the utmost importance to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have announced that they are in the process of informing the next of kin of the victim.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now being informed that it will be hours before they can re-enter the building.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, tearful.
She keeps saying, "This is so terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the barrier and another vehicle was outside.
Inside the barricade were several police officers guarding the apartment block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call the number 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and refer to the minutes entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of a controversy over rewriting history.
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The image storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's splendid portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century public opinion and part of the history of a figure many still feel is worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps in the late 19th century more than today, as someone who defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers to death
Local media reports said a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, whose surname was only given as Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
He reportedly arrived Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big boar in the barn with blood on its snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had bitten the farmers to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated", the cousin, who was given the surname Wu, was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent further attacks on people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the husband was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer between itself and a tractor, until the farmer's wife was able to scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playful.
They like to wriggle and are very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
The EU is not a party to the agreement, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Rosa had winds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 400 miles (620 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to form over the Pacific, moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa hits the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical moisture is being carried north into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches (25 cm) of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching trough to produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, rainfall of between one and three and four inches [2.5 and 10 cm] can cause dangerous tidal flooding, floating debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of nearly two to three inches [5 to 7.5 cm] per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in much of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 inches of precipitation is expected.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of flash floods with rapidly worsening conditions.
In view of the impending tropical rainfall, it is strongly discouraged to go into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging floods, and thunderstorms can bring local gusts of wind and dust.
The approaching trough is bringing localized heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Overall precipitation of over one centimetre is possible, which can lead to a small amount of floating debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first sporadic tropical showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, with rainfall spreading on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to spread across the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, severe temperature fluctuations are possible across the United States, as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, the central United States is a prime example of dramatic temperature variations.
There is a temperature difference of almost 40 degrees Fahrenheit between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
A warm early October is expected for much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures ranging from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast at a widespread 27°C.
New York City could reach 70 degrees on Tuesday, which is about six degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million viewers watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
Over 20 million viewers across six television networks on Thursday watched the heart-rending testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued as the networks cut their regular programming on Friday over a last-minute twist: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that would have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, that he had harassed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this didn't happen.
It's likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen watched the hearing.
The company has calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had aired the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
And Nielsen generally has trouble measuring office viewership.
To put this in perspective, this is about the size of the attendance at a football playoff or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented anchors strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, averaged 5.69 million viewers of the full-day hearing, the highest of any network, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen, which is the most-watched television network in the world.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters in the elevator loudly verbally harassed him on his way to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood for minutes with his eyes down as he was scolded, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you believe he's telling the country the truth?
"You have power, whereas so many women are powerless", said one woman.
Flake said his office released a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were live hours after the Judiciary Committee was supposed to vote on whether to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
Flake, however, said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and subsequently various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was significant because it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political ends
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of using Britain's future for political purposes and undermining the nation's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 for the Conservative Party convention.
In an interview published alongside her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson escalated his attack on her so-called "Chequers plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal to impose tariffs on each other by the UK and the EU "totally absurd".
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and booked in the Baton Rouge Police Department for manslaughter.
The agency released video footage of the altercation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As CBS affiliate WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found on the glasses.
After questioning, Simpson told police that he confessed to the fatal shots on Wayde.
The advocate reports that bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement agency for its "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-9, 195-pound winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shocked" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're always afraid of", Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of roughnecks and concussions.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have been detecting increased activity at the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence anniversary
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between riot police and pro-independence protesters, while thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the riot police, threw eggs at them and also sprayed paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets normally populated by tourists.
Later in the day, there were also clashes with the police, who used their batons to quell the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No Forgetting, No Forgiving" while they faced unionists who chanted "Long live Spain".
As reported by the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but hailed by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low, as the anti-secessionists largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police clashed violently outside the polling stations to prevent the vote.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he no longer sees the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence with hope.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite a significant, if narrow, victory in last December's regional elections, the Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the pro-police protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
'The best way to stand as a candidate in the European elections is to denounce the erosion of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government', he said.
London, England: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was repeatedly hit by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Also, the car may have been shot with an armrest.
A goal from the left means Livingston 's Rangers win , 1-0 .
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive in Gary Holt's team's second half equalising Hibernian.
Gerrard's side are unbeaten in the Premiership this season and will face Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, can extend his winning streak in the division to six games, meaning that head coach Holt has not lost since taking over from Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing a chance against some open-minded guests .
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers in a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive goal was achieved.
The Rangers allowed a free-kick, and Livingston provided an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly putting Menga in shooting position, who shot the goal with a touch from the middle of the penalty area.
The Rangers had dominated possession at this stage, but could not overcome the hosts' defence, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unharmed.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was blocked off with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow slugged the ball past Livingston from another standard situation.
Flanks repeatedly made it into Livingston's penalty area and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalties were denied - one by Halkett against the substituted Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
The European Union is a global player in the global economy.
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They have been consistently excellent and have exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Their playing style and team have changed little since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great credit for the way he has rocked the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the edge of the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach that standard.
Their last ball was insufficient - they only managed to penetrate the hosts once - and this is a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), smiling faces and blue skies were seen as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was meant to repair relations between the NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then travelled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for stopping a 25,000 strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Cyclist dies in Deptford after being hit by car
A cyclist has been killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. British Summer Time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended to the man, who died at the scene.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had been killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roadblocks and bus diversions have been put in place, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured during a riot at a maximum security men's prison.
The riots broke out at about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, British Summer Time, at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire, and have continued.
Specialist Tornado officers were called in to put an end to the disturbance, involving eight inmates, confined to one wing.
The officers were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Specialised prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend longer periods behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a convict.
Last October, deputies were called to the prison to deal with a major disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert-ridden southwest, bringing with it the risk of tidal flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday night and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come within 200 miles of Phoenix as tropical storms or tropical depressions!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center are predicting 5 to 10 centimeters of rain, with occasional rain up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-dominated Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely, and in some cases up to 10 centimeters may be possible.
For those who are not at risk of flood-like floods, the rainfall associated with pink may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial, since the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still be a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 86 miles per hour, and will be located 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, after which the hurricane will move northward at 12 miles per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
The precipitation can be heavy in parts of Mexico, creating a significant flooding risk.
From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonoran Desert, rainfall totals of 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible, reported weather.com.
Subsequently, Rosa will move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, and then move up through Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main hazard associated with Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonoran Desert and the desert-dominated southwest of the United States", the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these precipitation events, life-threatening floods and debris are expected in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, British summer time.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is stable.
Avon and Somerset police say a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
Officials asked anyone who had a record of the events on a mobile phone to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered "the cruelty, the wrath" of the Democrats.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democrats", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered "under the commonplace, the wrath of the Democrats" throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, rejecting allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified to her accusation at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh on this day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
I am not attacking, but I am actually attacking, he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump argued that Democrats see their mission as "resisting and blocking".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate by Friday, a senior GOP leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake, Casualty Rates Rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swam away, when huge waves hit beaches on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a strong earthquake and tsunami, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, killing many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach doing their activities and did not immediately run away, and they fell victim to it", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, told a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it washed away cars, logs and houses, it hit land, everything", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had been moving across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and businesses, bent and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was equivalent to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
Because of the city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have been larger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, and that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
According to Nugroh, communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", the statement said.
On Saturday, the authority was criticized for not informing the public that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building, desperately shouting to warn people on the street below him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes into the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun sending cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other vital supplies.
The city's airport remains closed until October and has been reopened only for emergency operations.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to over 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where staff are housed in tent shelters in the courtyard of their office, but according to Dosebas, they passed scenes of devastation on the way.
"They said they had seen many destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even as the relief teams began the hard task of getting disaster relief underway, some complained that skilled foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign financial aid, supplies, and personnel are only available if the site of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster at the moment", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 As soon as the government says, okay, this is a national disaster, we can accept international support. But so far this status does not apply.
As the second night descended on Palu since the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing hoped for one of the miracles that would brighten the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa-Roa Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
"As a senior paraglider, I have my own emotional burden to carry", he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated among the para-gliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who were attending the beach party.
But his messages were grey question marks instead of blue check marks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to put in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came running behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was meant for the machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name from  to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the moniker Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album Yandhi is expected.
He will be appearing on the show as a replacement for Ariana Grande, who was canceled due to "emotional reasons", according to the producer.
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it has a religious meaning for West, according to his own statement.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said in a conversation this year about his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, it is we.
From Kanye, which means "the one", it became just "Yeah" -- just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but revealed this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who West used to work with, has also spelled his name with and without the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilian population
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, as leftist student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly student grants and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities were driving young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
With China's increased activity in artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various branches of the US government, even though the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan: the country intends to become the number one in AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China office.
Lee praised previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be held as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It is not China that is taking away the best academics, it is the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring college cadets to work on AI in recent years.
Lee also believes that a change in US immigration policy could be beneficial to US AI efforts.
"I think that people with a PhD in AI should be offered automatic green cards", he said.
China's State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017 and is expected to be adopted by the end of 2017.
Lee said the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that fund US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month that it will invest $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, nothing has been done for months on U.S. legislation to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that it claims Greek territory, and has therefore vetoed Macedonia's admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout reached the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia, membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said they will abide by the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I'm here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a referendum on the change of the country's name, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join head on, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
'I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after his vote.
He said a 'yes' result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote "Yes".
For the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvering through the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defence in Saturday's 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his goal look ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he threw a pass to Sterling's left.
The English striker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who with his right shoe passed Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
It happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on that drive, way on the side of Brighton.
He threw a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sané needed a few moves to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues forward aimed the ball into the net just before it slipped.
City will play in the Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies ' game .
With the Nationals out of playoff contention, there was little reason to force another bet.
The always-performing schemer, however, hopes to be on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if it's relevant for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead in the NL West over the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking to secure their first division title.
Even though we're not playing for nothing, at least we can throw, because we know the atmosphere in the crowd here in Denver and the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I'd encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to enter this contest?
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly prone to throwing jokers in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, practiced Thursday in the bullpen and would throw on Sunday, his normal day off.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 record this season, a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President was indirectly referring to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big "I'm not running, but I'm actually running, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means, you see the meanness, the abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overpower to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission as 'resisting and blocking'.
"And you've seen that in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and abhorrent and dishonest".
He named the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document get out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm gonna wait for a  that was really bad body language  worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is not accepting all opinions.
The Party is intolerant of those who speak their mind.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to impeach me, it came as little surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told that they are not welcome just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way for her vigorous opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being a dissident of Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians.
The announcement of Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting said that 'the meetings are to be inclusive and productive'.
Most Friday night GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP have been just that.
Unfortunately, most meetings today do not have this tone, and the promised 'more friendly, more gentle' policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues who I thought I shared similar political views with before now expected me to turn around and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with, whether it was on national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - it doesn't matter what I say - there is a barrage of abuse on social media calling for my resignation, denouncing the political establishment and saying that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And I'm not alone in this experience.
In fact, I know I'm doing better than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face a daily barrage of sexist or racist insults and yet never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that name-calling has become the norm.
The Commission has already taken action to ensure that the European Union is able to meet the needs of the people of Europe.
In reality, we are no longer accepting all opinions, and with every motion of censure and every change in the electoral rules, the party is becoming more narrow-minded.
I've been told many times over the last two years to shut my head and not express my opinion so clearly, and I'd have no problems.
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government which literally tore my classroom apart in the whole school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, as a councillor as well as a cabinet minister.
I've never made a secret of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way in any doubt about my political positions and about areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday's motion, I would just say this: given the fact that the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I am addressing this message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of campaign threats or political expediency will stop me from acting in what I believe to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr vs Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr team takes the lead
Two late attempts may have skewed the final score a bit, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved the win in this highly entertaining match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, the home team's success was due to their superior defense as well as their better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead. However, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released by the Warriors for the game, and Jason Baggot caught an unimproved try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before scoring a goal at half-time and then scoring an increased try in the solo, making it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's try, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
A lengthy break followed after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the field, and Ayr extended his lead with a Stafford McDowall try from Climo.
Then Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and again Melrose, at the end of a period of enormous pressure, had the extra man paid for by an unheard-of try from Bruce Colvine.
The home team came back, however, and as Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling a no-ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty lane behind the advancing Ayr pack.
Climo's up almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth try.
Still Game star seems ready for new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready for a change to the hospitality industry after it emerged he was named as the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, for which he writes the scripts and in which he plays one of the main roles alongside his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and Kiernan appears to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': land-locked Bolivia hopes a court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol outside the ornate naval headquarters in La Paz.
A blue flag is flown on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases have a motto: "The sea is our rightful property.
To recover it is a duty.
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastal strip lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is as vivid as the desire to sail across the Pacific again.
These hopes may be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice, due on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calmness and is expecting the result with a positive attitude, of course said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ruling on large screens in the hope that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim, which requires Chile to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia after decades of sporadic talks.
For Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, there is also a lot at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are on the verge of returning to the Pacific", he vowed in late August.
However, some analysts say it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and believe that it would make little difference.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to speak on Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ICJ's judgment is already available six months after the final plea suggests, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, that the case was not complicated.
Far from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years may also be a setback.
The current Bolivian government has taken the issue of access to the sea into its own hands, said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' bellicose rhetoric had stifled any remaining goodwill in Chile.
I am sure that the Commission will be able to give its opinion on this matter in due course.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Vzéelt, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia had "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of conflict for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the sea as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The judgment is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to put into practice the promises made at a summit between the rival heads of state in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, appears to be on the verge of re-launching stalled nuclear diplomacy.
Ri called the idea that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees "a pipe dream".
Washington is skeptical and would not agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking substantial disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal, which it probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for the giant headdresses that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to add to your hat collection or to cover the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed off a range of crazy oversized headwear for their 2019 summer collection on the catwalk, which captivated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-popping creations across the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige-colored hat with a wide, featherlike brim that almost crushed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled watermelons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but these were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were embroidered with lipstick and more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a scuba gear, including snorkel and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted ice pack.
And if you want to make another huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that the giant headdresses could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on from "La Bomba", the two-foot-wide straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wears.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that made waves on social media sent another big creation over the runway: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model holding the bag.
The red-orange bust bag with bust fringe and a white leather hook was the highlight of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has created such a buzz that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools continue to excel in academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results, and is only underpinned by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other community-based enterprises.
With over 30,000 pupils from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest possible level of care to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, for the profession of their choice and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought-after as elective subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you reach his head".
If you speak to him in his own language, you'll reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
We see in the latest examination results this year that the languages with the highest pass rates are at the top of the independent schools' rankings.
A total of 68 per cent of the pupils who took foreign languages achieved A grades in the higher examinations.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A on the higher-level examinations, while 72 percent of students learning German, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also scored A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as electives, alongside STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 per cent of the reasons employers cited for problems filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
The need for language skills is therefore becoming more and more pressing in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more open positions require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives multilingual people an edge over their competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
That's why it's important for children today that we invest in language education now.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, independent schools will always have a range of languages to choose from with appropriately specialised teachers.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this point in a global economic environment, it is undeniable that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It's got to be fair.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James play for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he'll play is not yet clear.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play only a few minutes.
Earlier this week, after practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
'I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare myself,' he said.
Timing of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies Trump has planned for next week, including in places he is sympathetic to, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on whether to confirm his nomination for the Supreme Court vacancy hanging in the balance, Trump is looking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the process.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct hearings, which have been conducted in a tense atmosphere this week, with the expected Senate vote on confirmation pending for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this rallying series is to support Republicans who face a tough election in November.
So President Trump's campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies over the next week are designed to "mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Control of Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches", a Trump campaign official, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could be at the rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and media outlets from Pittsburgh could be reporting.
Saturday's visit is Trump's second this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to rally support for the Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows battle spirit to keep the hopes alive for Sunday's singles
After three one-sided matches, the four-man match on Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a pure invention as a sporting concept, but one that the players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were six points ahead and now they're four, so I think that's a little bit of a boost for us", Jordan Spieth said as he left the field.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of being four points ahead, with twelve others following.
The Americans, however, feel a little wind in their sails and have reason to be encouraged, according to Spieth, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and can each score three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the tee to the green and he's leading by example.
The guttural cheers became louder as he made a key putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had trailed by two points after two holes.
His putt, which decided the match for them on the 15th hole, elicited a similar cry, suggesting that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really have to get down and take care of my own game", Spieth said.
That's all the individual players have left.
18 holes to make a mark.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, undoubtedly making Ryder Cup history.
Europe's unlike but sympathetic duo is four points out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only pair that had not bogeyed on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided bogeying on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the crowd reinforces that they are the players to beat on Sunday, with Fleetwood and Molinari the favourites to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
But it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-hero who played alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes in a tight corner they could not even come close to overcoming.
But on Sunday, no one can help them out of their predicament.
The fours and fours pairs are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or don't give, and the way a strategy can change in a flash.
The Europeans have been playing better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the final day, but this quarterfinal also showed that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe are 10-6 up after Saturday's fours and four-balls against the USA and are heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup with a solid lead.
The brilliantly-played duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods and scored four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, who want to win back the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the fours in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series with 3: 1.
In the four-game series, the U.S. put up more of a fight, winning two games, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 singles played on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their opening four matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized brilliantly and beat the disenchanted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning foursome, returned to play as Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursome, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world number one and number three.
But on this pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris, Europe was not going according to plan.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory in the fours over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a four-point lead, but as the title holders, Furyks' team needs a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of second place, it doesn't look like they'll be able to launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "major goodwill" measures in the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to not proliferate nuclear weapons and technologies.
'We do not see any response from the US,' he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Ri repeated North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, in which Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump agreed to security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington is resisting calls for an easing of the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearisation first and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, even opposing the declaration of the end of the war, Ri said.
The assumption that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a fantasy of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not elaborate on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If South Korea had been the other party to the denuclearization issue instead of the US, the Korean Peninsula denuclearization would not have come to this standstill".
Still, the tone of Rice's speech was vastly different from his speech last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missiles were inevitably aimed at the US mainland after "evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, showered Kim with praise at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions would have to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously in any case until we achieve complete, final and verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry up Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he said as he left Pyongyang that progress had been made, only to be accused by North Korea hours later of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate action.
He said Kim told him the "appropriate measures" sought were security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough sleep in a class
A new course at Harvard University is ensuring that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year, a countermeasure to the spreading macho culture of staying up with caffeine and studying all night.
One scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often careless about their health.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
 At the end, a girl came to me and asked,  Why am I only learning about this now, in my senior year? 
"No one had ever told her how important sleep was", she said, "and that surprised me".
The first-year course taught students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and athletic performance as well as to overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see a picture of a room in a dorm and click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books, providing information on the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to reflect on their daily routine, using a map of the university campus with interactive symbols.
We know that it won't change the behavior of the students right away.
But we believe they have a right to know this - just as you have a right to know how your choice to smoke affects your health", added Professor Czeisler.
The pride in doing a 'night shift' was still widespread, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep should be the "secret weapon" of all students against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, and would prevent weight gain, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to pursue a university-wide course.
He hopes that the next step will be to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar programme of study before entering the competitive university.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston against Rangers 1-0: Menga-Gor defeats Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's shot for Steven Gerrard's disunited team meant a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga met seven minutes before halftime, and the inspiration-poor Rangers seemed to have no chance of equalising.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, behind only Hibernian in goal difference.
The Rangers are also in for more trouble after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury from what appears to be a thrown object from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stuck with the same 11 Livingston players who took a point away from Hearts last week, and must be thrilled to see his well-trained team keep their opponents under pressure at every turn.
The Rangers dominated possession, but Livingston was more effective when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after just two minutes when Menga's first serve led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and missed.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the back post.
The Rangers took control, but their play in the final quarter seemed more hopeful than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos apparently thought that he should have been given a penalty after a fifteen-minute clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not accept the complaints of the Colombian.
Rangers have only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute may not have been in keeping with the flow of the game, there is no denying that they had earned it for their hard work alone.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't handle a long ball thrown by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and selected Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent at halftime, the change made an almost immediate impact as the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they were meant to play, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball one after the other.
Holt's team could have built their lead in the final period, but McGregor held on and held off Jacobs before Lithgow headed a corner ball past.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton also late called for a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, also became a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter that's used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.
I actually hear a crack!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' degenerated cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy degenerate cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to recognise damaged cells during treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory.
These cells can see a protein that many cancers share and then they're injected back in.
One test substance shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize degenerated cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory to make them recognize the protein HER2, which is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar technique, in which immune cells are taken from patients and taught to attack cancer cells, has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after his appearance on SNL, wearing a MAGA cap.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after he lavishly praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, "Ghost Town", wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he continued with a barrage of pro-Democracy language and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
I get asked so many times by white people, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist".
So if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual harassment allegations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's rant was not aired, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the publication.
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble backstage because of his headgear.
They were harassing me backstage.
You said, "Don't go out with the hat".
You've been harassing me!
And then they say I was in a sunken area", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said he'd put on my Superman cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His remarks at least twice caused boos from the audience, and SNL staff seemed embarrassed, Variety reported.
West was hired late to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a talk titled "I Love It" in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR SETTING YOU AGAINST THE MASS".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just being himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
But I do NOT want to reward someone who I think is embracing and giving out an ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying their music or their clothes or supporting their art).
He's free.
The same applies to us.
Prior to the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "The being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper counterpart Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Charged with attempted murder in connection with stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is to appear before the Belfast Arbitration Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
♪ I'm gonna be the one who's gonna be the one ♪
Kit Harington is best known for his role as sword-wielding Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that on-screen roles like this often make boys feel they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that solving the problem was "very important" to him.
'I personally find it very important at this time to ask what went wrong with masculinity,' he said.
What have we taught male adolescents about the problem we are now seeing?
Harington believes that television, due to its very masculine characters, may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: "What is born, and what is learned?
What is it that is taught on television and on the street that makes the boy feel that he has to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
Because clearly something has gone wrong with the young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he will not be participating in any prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer.
From November, Harington will be seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him, the best thing about "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so that's how I got my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose Leslie played the role of Ygritte, the mistress of Harington's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14°% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 year-over-year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a pressing problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is reported to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted through inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staffers leaked the GOP senators' data, criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied claims that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the members' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that the claims were being spread by "extreme right-wing" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more abominable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information is said to include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by an unidentified individual in the government district.
The release came after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office, and published the information of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
The member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
"This denial is furious", wrote Fleischer.
Which suggests she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
People who are accused of something they didn't do shouldn't be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You cannot question the prosecutor's motives.
You must be calm and collected.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big deal if this is true", he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
'We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,' she continued, 'and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.'
Review of Johnny English You only live three times
It's now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new British-tinged film, and that seems to be true of this revival of the action-comedy parody franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English: The Spy Who Shagged His Dog and came back stuttering in 2011 with Johnny English: Now.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obviously stupid we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the license of the hot-eyed, grimacing, incompetent Johnny English has been extended for the second time to screw up, signaling more than anything else that he is a generic comic creation for non-English-speaking moviegoers.
Of course, he's the crazy secret agent who bizarrely thinks he's cool and worldly, when in fact he's just a little Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean, and a little bit of this guy who contributed a single note to the title tune of "The Winner's Hour" at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaotic back-traveler and international secret agent that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
Johnny English's latest adventure has a nice moment or two.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades tickled his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy comes to the fore, but the humor seems rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially since the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinsons' silent film gag in the role of Bean.
The ever-current premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret British spy agency network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the job, much to the displeasure of the agent on duty, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and bullied figure who is already on the verge of a complete breakdown due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn't give her much to work with
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been uncovered and therefore she must bring in someone from retirement.
Including the goofy Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a fancy institution, but unofficially teaches classes in working as an undercover agent.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his formerly hardened sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a nerdy, high-society woman who's been played by Vicki Pepperdine, who's a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who have been doing everything terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, and they're meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously drawn into the arms of a charismatic tech billionaire, the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque banter: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, they cause chaos when they sneak aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
This last sequence is a complete and total exercise, but as fun and enjoyable as it is, it is a subject that is already being discussed at length on children's television.
It's a fairly moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself: 'Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really lives up to his talent?'
Labour denies working on a plan that would see Britons working four days a week but being paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that would see the British working four days a week, but getting paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to employees in the form of an extra day off.
This would give employees a three-day weekend, but would still pay the same.
Sources say the idea fits with the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of workers.
The change to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A review of the guidelines is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
A shift will not come overnight, but a four-day work week is an effort that is in line with the party's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial policy strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to advocate such an idea, with the Green Party already promising during the 2017 general election campaign to introduce a four-day week.
However, the approach is currently not generally supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, at last week's Labour conference, articulated his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to win back the power of "anonymous directors" and "profit-makers" in public utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of the water companies may not be able to retain their full stake, as a Labour government could make 'depreciations' due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to company boards and to set up inclusive ownership funds to give 10% of the equity of private companies to employees, who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in the news magazine 60 Minutes on whether the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency's findings could sway Republican senators to support it.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that might ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I told the court I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, that allegation was made, and asked if he did it.
He was determined, decisive and unmistakable.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be set in stone.
"My opinion is firm on Brett Kavanaugh, and it would be a bombshell", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied this", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all those who called her could not confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
And I can't see any changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to fight global poverty.
Tens of thousands will be attending the seventh annual Global Citizen Festival, not only to see the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's ultimate goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to fight poverty by motivating more people to take an active part in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), one has to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (via email or phone) or similar actions to raise awareness of the goal of fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen has 12 years to go before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of promoting a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it's time to act, or just another case of what's called clicktivism - if you think you can make a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reported that the project has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011 and has achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped to inspire leaders around the world to announce commitments and policies worth over 37 billion dollars that will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least US$10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to supporting children to reach their full potential, and who have pledged to help Rwanda with $35 million to fight malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social inequality of undernourishment a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, which is the question, what are the reasons why Global Citizen is able to fight extreme poverty?
They answered: 'It will be a long and tiring journey with ups and downs.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, along with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
US could use Navy for blockade purposes to impede Russian energy exports  Ministry of Interior
Washington can use the Navy if necessary to keep energy from Russia out of markets including the Middle East, according to the Washington Examine, as reported by US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's deployment in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets, and that Russia is currently operating in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
"I think the real reason for Russia's involvement in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe", he allegedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways to address this.
The United States can work with the Navy to ensure that sea lanes remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that sees itself as the "voice of electricity consumers" in the US.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
Using and replacing fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia, he said, while calling Russia a One-trick pony with a fossil fuel dependent economy.
The statements were made as the Trump administration was about to expand LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia as the far less expensive option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received a counter-proposal from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, the BDI's chief executive, after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to run for president in 2020 to check out , says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a run.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to "scrutch" a presidential candidate after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about the way Donald Trump is treating our democracy", she said.
Warren has been very vocal in her criticism of Donald Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's electorate does not believe she should run for office in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of the voters supported such a candidate.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidate, and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats who are in the running for the 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump rally on post-traumatic stress disorder, which Palin suffers from
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when he comes back, all of that can be felt by other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers come back with", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans that they come back changed, that they come back more abruptly, that they come back and wonder if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military has given to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a new asylum policy appeal
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a court-approved affidavit Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She shared that her partner - and his violent bandits - abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace identified El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of people apply for asylum in the US, as nations that have major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international levels".
The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle, was stated in the expert's statement.
The lawyers further argued in the statement that the policy of denying immigrants entry to the country has a detrimental effect on the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to be entrepreneurs and to provide the necessary manpower.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum exists for all who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political belief", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It was never the plan to mitigate all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world, by granting asylum.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll in race for time doubles
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she soothes her feverish son at a rescue center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, a new ambulance comes with dead bodies.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their soaked belongings and to dig up whatever they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals that were damaged by the 7.5 earthquake were completely overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured vertebra and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the powerful earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
It all happened too fast.
"I think I was trapped under the collapsed walls", he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place.
US Ambassador accuses China of tyranny with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused the capital Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid for China Daily's obituary in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after he accused China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election are consistent with what US officials told Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign launched by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to run advertisements to boost the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a festering trade war, with tariffs on imports from both countries.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, which exports a large amount of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has harmed workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, Branstad said in a Des Moines Register op-ed on Sunday, is now doubling down on this tyranny by running propaganda ads in its own free press in the US.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is challenging America's tried-and-tested tradition of free speech and an independent press by running paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
In contrast, you will find only a limited number of opposing voices here in Beijing at newsstands and no real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people might have about China's troubling economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers declined to publish his article, but did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are scaring voters ahead of midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, observers warn
With many of the most influential Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections that could come from women in particular.
The mood on this issue has been extremely tense, and most Republicans have already indicated that they will go ahead with a vote.
"These are things you can't undo", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation was enough to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget yesterday, they don't forget tomorrow, and they don't forget November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. daily on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate lobby chanted "November is coming!" as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to hold on to Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is an extremely important issue, Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political observer, told the news site.
People say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, even though they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, observers indicated that a backlash could ensue if Republicans pushed the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the panel voting, the final vote, or the Kavanaugh review; it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democratic elections, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided over who to believe based on the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger proportion siding with the latter.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or likely to believe Ford's statement, while 35% said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
Further, 38% said they believe Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that she was assaulted by the drunken Kavanaugh when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her at a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup with the goal of establishing a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech giant's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee admitted that the intention behind Inrupt was to "world dominate".
"We have to get active now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and corporate sectors.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of the content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data store is that the user can decide alone who can access what data.
The company describes this concept as personal empowerment and development through data.
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company puts resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide will be able to build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a major change, where they completely redesign their entire business models overnight.
 We're not asking for their permission. 
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-state Web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee reshaped the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a key player in the net neutrality debate.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the web", he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, winner of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant in World War I was honored 100 years later in his home town.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his actions in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and never learned that he had won Britain's highest military decoration.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolism, since the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic deed for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he advanced to the line of fire and with the "greatest of bravery" led the line forward before he raced ahead with a field weapon in single-handed and took out three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time, something that made him feel humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honoured to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a true hero is shown above all by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of Peppa Pig.
Imagine if you stayed up all night watching a thrilling Bellator 206, and then you couldn't watch the main event.
The San Jose bill featured 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
Then, at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the UK audience was in for quite a surprise when Peppa Pig suddenly appeared.
Some were untouched after staying up until the early hours of the morning to watch the fight.
A fan described the switch to the cartoon character on Twitter as a sort of bad joke.
"Because of government regulations, this content is deemed not youth-friendly, so it had to be changed to a kids' show at 6 o'clock", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa, the pig, that's right.
Bellator's chief executive officer, Scott Coker, said that the company would revise the schedule to accommodate UK viewers in the future.
'I think the problem could be solved in the second leg,' he said.
But it's 6am on a Sunday morning for viewers in the UK, and we won't solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're sticking to it.
There was a lot of communication going on during the transition, and it was a lot of confusion, and it wasn't always nice.
We tried to solve the problem, assuming it was a technical glitch.
Which was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're gonna narrow it down to five fights instead of the usual six, and we're trying to give the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite regrettable.
Tom Daley feels "undermined" when it comes to sexuality
Tom Daley, who has competed in several Olympic water-jumpers, says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but it was this feeling that motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that it was only in secondary school that he realized that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, winning the Olympics is not as important to him.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, is taking a sick leave of absence for several months.
In the first Laverne episode, he said that he used to consider himself inferior in comparison to others, since love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said, "To this day, the feeling of being inferior and different from others is the basis of my power and strength and ultimately my success".
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a prominent LGBT activist, and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to push for the decriminalization of homosexuality in more countries.
He said he had spoken out on this issue because he was fortunate to be able to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wanted to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, and the realization of falling in love with a man was a complete surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner the previous year, but he shared that the age gap had never been an issue.
He says that when you've been through so much as a child and a teenager - he first competed in the Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone his age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son since June, who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his entire outlook has changed since then.
Last year, he would have been all about gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important things than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main asset.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father didn't accept his impending death, and one of the last things he asked for was tickets to London 2012, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be there anymore", he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally realize that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
"All I knew was that it had always been my dream to dive at the Olympics in front of a home crowd - it was crazy", he said.
His first song selection  Proud by Heather Small  was also influenced by this, a song he heard in the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who is currently out of shape, will be on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
Phil Mickelson will set a new record in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he's going to have to work hard to keep it from turning into a disaster.
Mickelson, playing in the event for the 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he usually did, the five-time major champion spent his day cheering and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that plagued him.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer, and thus not an ideal fit for the cramped Le Golf National golf course, where misdirected balls are regularly penalized.
And as if the venue itself wasn't discouraging enough, in game nine on Sunday, Mickelson will meet the perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, new to these tournaments, to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans are four points behind in the 12 singles games and get a hot start, Mickelson's play could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and couldn't add much to that either.
"He was completely clear about his role today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said that he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's one of the most recognizable faces in the world, and he's done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd be in two games.
I had more in mind, but this is what happened and this is what we expected.
He wants to be part of it, like everyone else.
Mickelson will match Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup matches played on a Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven shutouts, although Furyk said his presence has added to the team's fortunes.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he's a great guy who's popular with the whole team", he explained.
I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit better this week.
He's a really interesting person, who gives a lot of impulses.
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead may soon be over.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading into the final Ryder Cup singles match can quickly turn into an unpleasant situation.
The Danes made their debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but barely crossed the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, securing a 141⁄2131⁄2 victory.
"The idea is that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that was just by a long shot", said Bjørn (pictured) after seeing the Class of 2018 win 53 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le National Golf.
Experience tells me and all team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow is the real thing.
You just put yourself out there and do the right thing.
This whole thing is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what we're up against on the other side: the best players in the world.
Excited by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: 'I would never rush it.
Tomorrow will be a different caliber.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will be the focus and that is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested to the limit of your golfing ability.
You have to make it clear to the players: get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind and he has to get the best out of him too.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players do better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those great upsets on the final day of the tournament, standing on the winning side in Brooklyn before standing on the losing side after Europe's miracle of Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the final day.
We got 12 big games tomorrow, but you guys want to get off to a fast start like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middlemen under a lot of pressure.
We'll put our team together and send our boys out as we feel like, you know, we'll try to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with finding a way to counterattack, and he will have to face Rory McIlroy in the top-flight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the rankings.
'I chose the boys in this order because I think it covers everything,' says Bjorn about his choice of single encounters.
Germany 's new warship delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but local media said it will not be delivered until next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time, which referred to a military speaker.
The ship was due to enter service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by troubling post-delivery problems.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, ordered by the Navy as early as 2007, are intended to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
The aim of the project is to develop a new nuclear-powered ballistic missile capable of delivering a range of high-powered missiles, including a range of anti-aircraft missiles and surface-to-air missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance periods, and it should be possible for the latest frigates not to return to their home ports for up to two years.
But the ongoing delays may mean that the state-of-the-art warships that are supposed to represent Germany as a sea power will already be obsolete by the time they are commissioned, Die Zeit said.
The F125 frigate, which was the victim of a disaster, made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after it had been delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, however, German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware errors" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly severe as Baden-Württemberg-class ships are manned by a crew of only 120 sailors, about half the number on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship is much too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the cost of training the crew, became a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's defense minister, confirmed that the navy was running out of operational vessels.
Bartels said the problem has grown over time as old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could be taken from the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
A property in the Scottish Highlands is the site of new research to show how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to inform future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will trace the presence of dwarf and mosquito bats, as well as the brown long-eared bat and water bats at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key locations on the property to record the bats' activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile scans with portable detectors.
Experts use sound analysis of all the recordings to determine the frequency of bat calls and to identify which species is doing what.
A map and report of the habitat is then produced to give a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how each species uses them.
This data will help to determine the benefits of habitat management measures such as the creation of grasslands and show how to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work which affects sleeping places and leads to loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-fishing and the chemical treatment of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their night hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout Scotland, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal habitat for them.
'Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,' he explains.
We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and a great habitat.
But there's a lot that we don't know about bats, so we're doing this work here and on other estates that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.
It emphasises the importance of excluding the presence of bats from properties prior to maintenance work, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young and wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the community to help.
She explains: 'We have a lot to learn about bats, and for many of our species, we don't know what their populations are like.'
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, while his lawyers are suing the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news" and said that people want to become "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence on the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news" just hours after they were published.
I'm not going to do it.
"What you've reported today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
You want to make a name for yourself by using my name.
It's only natural.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the Mirror over the allegations, which they described as "illegitimate coverage of suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for "moral damage" in a amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on one knee after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 percent good guy" who had succumbed to "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but says it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but later settled out of court because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to undo the settlement, as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and moved to Italian giants Juve this summer in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would 'forever regret' the loss of car makers
The UK would "always regret" losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, says Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He said it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby should Britain leave the EU.
"We need a deal", said Clark.
The Japanese carmaker indicated that the impact of delays at the border could lead to job losses in a no-deal Brexit.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis product lines, produced almost 150 000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit, we will see production stoppages at our plant at the end of March", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard Brexit without a deal and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing facility operates on a 'just-in-time' basis, meaning that parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU to make the cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruption at the borders, which the industry says could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain more than a day's supply of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production had to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU was 'exactly designed to avoid such checks at the border'.
"We need a deal, we want the best deal that allows us, as I said, not only to enjoy the success we have now, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The findings not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the supply chains that have been very successful so far.
Toyota could not specify how long the production would have to be interrupted, but warned that in the long run additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union's top official at the plant, said that its members are increasingly worried: "In my experience these jobs, once they are gone, will never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump 's scheduled meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again , according to the White House .
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's battle continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who has investigated Russian election meddling, links between Trump advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Assistant Attorney General and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the subject of hearsay in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had raised the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump and of impeaching the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he made his way to the White House last Monday as new reports emerged of his supposed resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time, was announced for next Thursday,
Trump stated that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein and she said: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week, but I can also imagine it being postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
We'll find out, but I like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters may disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences was not due to a dislike for the "showmanship" of TV reporters, but admitted: "I would not deny that they are showmanship".
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President is doing more round-trip Q&A than any President before him", she said, without providing any specific evidence: "We looked at these numbers".
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment is a step in the right direction.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks.
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why, as he made an out-of-control and sometimes bizarre appearance before a gathering of reporters.
Health minister writes to EU NHS staff over Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health addresses those from outside the EU who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of residence permit applications for EU citizens working in Scotland's decentralised civil service.
In your letter, Mr Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, the negotiations for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of what a troubling time this must be for all of you.
I therefore wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be delighted if you would stay here.
Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and just collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff provided oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher and transported for further examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has left the O.R. at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known as to the nature or extent of the injury", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, is playing his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of five tackles, bringing his total for the season to 18.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK
The UK Government has announced that it will be making a significant investment in the UK's infrastructure, including the building of a new high-speed rail link to the south of the country.
This move is designed to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to win over young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect anyone who does not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to generate up to £120 million a year in additional revenue to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, with the extra revenue to benefit the homeless.
This move is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in the stamp duty is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue intended to be used for the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and rental properties, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects the move to generate up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors who are not resident in the UK, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the real estate business.
Many of the country's affluent areas, particularly in the capital, have become 'ghost towns' due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to allow more young people to own their first homes.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's 'housing scandal'.
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular series of proposals for housing reform, ranging from a rent-free rate to a ban on evictions without a valid reason.
It also wants to give city councils more powers to build new housing.
May said: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for generations to come.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live and work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for non-UK residents and businesses based abroad to buy property as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too distant for too many people and the indignity of homelessness remains too much of a problem.
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to manage Scotland".
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, says that his "greatest goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team one day.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is relishing the challenge of breathing new life into the North East club, which is currently third in League One and three points behind the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back into the Scottish First Division last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I made it to the bench and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I've seen Scotland play in Hampden as a child with my father and that's something that always pulls me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I was successful in the management of the club.
Ross' predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such an established name at such a club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Success for me right now will be measured by whether I can get the club back in the Premier League.
"The structure and the opportunities at this club make it a Premier League club without a doubt", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I would only rate my time here as a success if I could get the club back there.
Ross has a management career spanning just three years, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from relegation to the third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than at any time in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real crossroads", he recalls when he took over Alloa.
I really believe that management was the right thing for me, even more than playing.
It sounds funny, because I was not bad at acting, I was good at making a living, and I had some very pleasant highs.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still go through this with the stress and pressure of my job, but management feels right.
I've never felt more comfortable in my own skin in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday, September 30th between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Radio Scotland's Sports Sound.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The summer heat wave has missed a boost to the revenues of Britain's struggling pubs, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Pub and bar businesses posted a 2.7 percent increase in revenue in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultancy, which compiled the figures, explained: "Sunset and England's longer-than-expected involvement in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when pubs saw sales increase by 2.8 per cent. Restaurants, however, were hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry in June continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks performed by far the best, with area-adjusted sales growth rising higher than it declined for restaurants.
Food-oriented pubs also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food sales fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, of RSM, the leisure and hospitality industry analyst, said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8% drop in sales over the previous year, along with ongoing cost pressures, will be particularly painful.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused business operators, and it remains to be seen whether the milder temperatures in August will provide the much-needed breathing space.
The overall growth in sales for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry revenue monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyses performance data from 47 active businesses with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide them from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has found an increase in so-called 'fake' Insta pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that they can keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in so-called "fake" Insta accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has fueled fears that sexual content is being shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean 'main account' that they could show to their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who was asking others to rape her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being tricked into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle becomes 'Voice of Athletes' at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish Athletics Association at its Annual General Meeting as a non-executive member.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sporting officials to benefit from her extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from her election to the council", said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I look forward to being the voice of athletes and hope to make a real contribution to and lead the sport in Scotland.'
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, claimed a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a frequent guest on BBC television, was unable to run after a temporary blood- circulation problem.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how much I'll recover.
It was hard work, but I have recovered completely, have learned to walk again, and today I am doing aerobic exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging news!
A milk pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows is causing a stir on the Internet
A milk pump manufacturer caused a stir online with a commercial clip comparing breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what it claims is the 'world's first silent portable breast pump', consumer technology manufacturer Elvie is releasing a not-so-serious music video to highlight the freedom the pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see my dick" or "If you haven't noticed, those aren't eucerums, those are my breasts".
The chorus goes on to say, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has met with mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it downplays the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young are taken away within a few days of birth", one commentary said.
Elvie's milk pump fits neatly into a breast-feeding bra
Another comment was: "Incomprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use it to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "Such an unreal advertisement".
Others defended the ad and one woman admitted that she found the song "very funny".
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
When I was pumping, I felt exactly like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a genius product, one person wrote.
Another person commented: This is a funny ad targeted at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an ad for or against the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group reveals to the women that they all danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies or even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, explained: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative introduction to the market.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows, we wanted to bring the pumps and all the challenges that come with them into the spotlight, while at the same time presenting in a fun and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly brought to a tent city on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children being detained is at an all-time high, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, in part because of the Trump administration's escalating rhetoric and policies that have made it more difficult to place children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers have been illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid of becoming targets for deportation themselves when they come forward to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
Nearly 80 per cent of people who are either carers themselves or members of a carer's household are in the country illegally and a large proportion of them are convicted foreigners.
We will therefore continue to pursue these individuals", said Mr Albence.
To speed up the processing of children's cases, officials introduced new rules that, according to shelter staff, require some children to appear in court within one month of being taken into custody, instead of the previous standard of 60 days.
Many will appear in person rather than via video link to argue their legal status before an immigration judge.
If the decision is negative, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children are in custody, the more likely they are, according to the information provided by the shelter staff and reports that have emerged from the system in the last month, to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated by a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is having problems are more easily overlooked because of the size.
They also explained that the trauma many of the children are already suffering could be exacerbated if they were taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's civil war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and are being treated accordingly.
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" of both "terrorist groups" and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were in place and he accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that would prevent refugees from returning home.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to make the return possible, he said.
You are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid would be given to Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib was an opportunity to move political talks forward.
The deal between Russia and Turkey diverted a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear timelines" and expressed hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, will be "wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the Syrian government's conditions for participation in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Reelection
With this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers probably hope, an impeachment or scandal did not prematurely end his presidency.
This would be without a doubt the most dramatic end to a presidency in history.
So far, there's no sign that the audience is getting tired.
Since 2014, prime-time viewing rates at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and at MSNBC, they've almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"It's like a fire that magically draws people in because it's something we don't understand", says Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked him why.
"Because he makes me laugh", Scovell told me.
The chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything you'll find on TV, can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion, the potential for family reunification and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's more than being an informed citizen when you realize you've already watched six hours of an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket (the Washington Post calls it a "clothing piece rich with self-esteem"), or the impact of Stormy Daniel's racy description of Trump's, um, anatomy.
I, for one, will never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he does is make it feel like a reality show he's putting on every night", says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "The Three from the Pantheon" series, about Trump's rotating cast and daily routines (breaking a row with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you're not gonna make it.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside his house on the north shore of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he was crawling inside watching MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He just couldn't get away from the screen, not when judge-nominated Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Donor money flooded the closest races for congressional seats in the midterm elections.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is being flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn district boundaries that have resulted in two incumbents vying for the same seat.
The newly redrawn suburban district in Pittsburgh will be represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a battle of campaign finance between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became well known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly-watched special election in March for the state's 18th congressional district.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and Trump won it by 20 percentage points.
Political analysts are giving the Democrats a slight lead.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but then backed away
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without much resistance from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to remove the heads of all American missions abroad from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in light of recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, punitive measures were considered only in the case of El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed punitive measures, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar gathering the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to deter migrants from heading toward the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending consideration of punitive action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the mid-October conference, according to diplomats, to signal the importance the administration is giving to the gathering.
The three American diplomats quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity about the internal discussions.
Their comments were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learning from History
The next big surprise may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now ample evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Trump's campaign team colluded with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If the congressional majority changes, Trump would face a body that would hold him accountable at the very moment he is preparing to appear before the voters again, and possibly before a jury.
There are many whys, and I don't want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European rivals, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West merely resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the inexorable march of democracy is either accelerated or retarded.
Americans are facing several such turning points right now.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who will decide the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the devil's kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he proposed secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the story that the New York Times has told him.
How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and perjury while in office?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm election for a Congress that holds Trump to account?
If we fail these tests, we'll have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that had once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me out 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic with this legacy?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of the game against Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a good position for qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
Graham Dorrans has been ruled out of action with a knee injury until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villareal is very good", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could make something of it and we went home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, a tie was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they scored a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we can go through with the crowd behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can now look forward, put the last season behind us and succeed.
Fear of retirement benefits causes women to have sleepless nights.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the women in the Nationwide study said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the one you should start with.
Talk to your spouse and children about how you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in a timely manner.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a major factor in determining cost.
Bring your financial adviser on board: your adviser can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial choices for long-term care can include traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a proxy so that you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals follow your wishes should you be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're unable to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that matter, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is drug treatment?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Have you finished this plan?
Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home from work among friends.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. British time, as "arbitrary".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the communication systems that were down, aid workers were unable to obtain information from Donggala District Government, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a local government area that stretches over a 300 km (180 mi) stretch of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, an administrative unit below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, hitting 14 countries and killing 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, nearly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya district of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died from collapsing buildings.
2018: A severe earthquake struck the popular tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and former vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resisting state violence, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone of an acquaintance when she tried to contact the police.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, according to KTUU, and a $500 bail has been posted.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he responded "not guilty, absolutely" when asked about his plea, according to the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has been the subject of criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and possession of a firearm while under the influence of drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Hundreds killed in tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks have been cut and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos of the wave hitting the country have been circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for suspected terrorists in the New York attacks.
The New York State Attorney General is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack that claimed eight lives, a rare sentence that has not been imposed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented pickup truck from the Home Depot chain of home improvement stores for a terrorist attack, in which he raced down a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, assaulting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty motion filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by death, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on a 22-count indictment, which includes eight counts of murder in the context of organized crime, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "fundamental planning and intent", according to the accusers, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as "abhorrent, cruel and depraved".
He was also responsible for the repression of the civilian population in the DRC, including the killing of at least two civilians in the DRC.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a case with the intent to seek the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers and eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal execution in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the act after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also demanded, according to police, that the ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilty in exchange for a life sentence with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma suffered by all those involved, said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
The European Parliament has been asked to consider the possibility of a referendum on the EU's membership of the European Union.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" during a protest rally at the Tory conference today.
The former Ukip leader said politicians 'must feel the pressure' from Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be "out" if Farage became Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided party was exacerbated by the fact that members of her party who are in favour of remaining in the EU took part in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the backlash, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between her package and the 'chaos'.
Bone stated at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that Chequers belongs in the trash.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will be in favour of Brexit but Chequers belongs in the trash.'
Stressing his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong".
The Conservatives' pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The compromise is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our own party and with our activists who are actually walking the streets and getting us elected.
Please stop checking and start listening.
In a sharp message to May, she continued: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs if they keep their promises.'
Farage said in a speech that politicians "must feel the pressure" if they are about to cheat the 2016 referendum decision.
"This is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class", said Farage.
They are trying to cheat Brexit and that's why we are here today to tell them: you will not get away with it.
He went on to say to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country who helped us win the referendum and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, anti-Brexit protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners from the Tories Against Brexit grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party that was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Labour Party peer, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, just like all the technology, are there for Canada Plus Plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", Adonis said.
It's a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to run for president exactly
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would "take a close look" at the presidential candidate.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She was the focus of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was their 36th meeting with voters in what is known as the town hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she would like to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women at the top.
Arrested after shooting LSU player Sims to death
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that they had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to sports media outlet 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possession of a weapon and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-2 Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the World Championship after his team let him win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas drove past Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's stall order would play a big part in the race.
From the pole Bottas got off to a good start and it was almost like he was leading Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel went into the pits first and let Hamilton crash into the traffic at the end of the field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and landed behind Vettel, but was overtaken by Hamilton after a tight wheel-on-wheel manoeuvre in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, risking to wait after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in one of the back seats of the field and was seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, as he held on to his tyres to finish fast and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually went into the box on lap 44 and failed to make a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri had been a brilliant performer all weekend and acted like a true gentleman when he was asked to let me pass.
The team did a great job to get a double win", said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign event Saturday for insisting she had not released to the press the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
At the West Virginia event, President Ford did not directly address the Senate Judiciary Committee's testimony, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are "mean, mean, and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean-spirited and dishonest", the president said.
When you look at the leaks and you say, "Oh, that wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think about your answer -- publish the document -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, you know.
I didn't publish it.
Okay, one moment, please.
"We have not published it", he added, imitating the senator's voice.
The letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was leaked to Feinstein in July and was published in early September, although Feinstein denies that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish your story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep the letter secret and I granted her request for secrecy.
Her denial seemed to go down badly with the president, who said at the campaign rally on Saturday night, "I'll tell you what, that was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his continuing defense of the judicial nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, he claimed that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
The President of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. Aliyev, said that the EU had been "a great ally of the United States, a great ally of the world".

Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win in the replay at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead after shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the game before Dwyer re-established the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee unexpectedly 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third defeat in the Elite League this season.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after a pass from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the pass as Beauvillier extended the lead.
In this exciting opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped to their equalising goal at 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before halftime when he scored his second goal of the night just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equaled with a power-play goal in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second half, and Nielsen then secured his team's victory with a fifth goal just halfway through the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Pilot dies after making sure hundreds of people on a plane escape earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died trying to get a plane with hundreds of people on board safely off the ground.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was rocked by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are still being felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the shaky control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped off the tower when he thought he was going to fall.
Agung later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Indonesia's air safety service, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
We are deeply concerned by this news,' he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the National Disaster Management Authority has said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble while others cannot be reached, said authority spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high have devastated Palu, which will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing relief and relief supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute there is a new ambulance with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and in a speech to the country's military, said: I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you're ready?
Indonesia has been rocked by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, which killed over 550 people.
Air Niugini reports missing person after plane crash in Laguna
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting a missing person, after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane went off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"This is a very good thing", says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working nearby on improving a docking area rushed in with an inflatable boat to help get people to shore before the plane sank in about 100 feet of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them were on Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up its evidence on Saturday in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a Mississippi woman in 2014.
For hours, U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in the field of information extraction.
He told the jury how he used cell phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of their deaths.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his earlier statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the records showed that his phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he lied about being in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
But cell phone records indicate that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis was leaking their messages, calls, and contact information from his phone for some time after Chambers' death.
"He's cut her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin their pleadings on Sunday.
The judge will assume that the case will go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after racist text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was still black.
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her shock when she found out that the new daycare worker, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEIN, NOCH A SCHWARZE", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message, which was sent to her by her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After realizing her faux pas, the "slightly touched" Plasco flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American midwife had done a poor job and was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home on an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the $350 a day she was supposed to spend over six months on the job she was originally hired to do, but without a contract, and for which she would have been living with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that", she told the newspaper on Friday, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, arguing that firing them was the sensible move, as they feared that Maurice, after having insulted them, could no longer be trusted.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you trust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on , now .
Plasco compared the litigation to 'blackmail' and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and that she was 'in a difficult situation'.
You want to prosecute a person like that?
That's not very nice", added the investment banker.
As the legal battle continues, the couple has been swiftly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, the daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
Today it's very funny with our knowledge today of Paddington's huge success.
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with it, had his work been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication following his death last year was "bittersweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family".
He was a very quiet man and did not brag, Jankel said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something special: you're proud, even if it wasn't really your own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself the credit for its success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone .
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that she looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance", says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got the call from Nad, telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey".
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping, it was slowly dying and leaving her body.
She had just died, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I had my head down and tears were running down my cheeks the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hanging signs to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up cards on a bridge in Wales with messages of inspiration and telephone numbers for counselling.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day, she explained.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son had a promising career as a chef and had a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up a room.
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after his brother, then 11 years old, committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm always worried that there might be a fallout".
Davis designed the cards to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent, we need to talk about this.
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling down or depressed", she explained.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day, when the kids were unwrapping their presents, and he wasn't looking them in the eye or anything.
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that we had to go through it: it tore a huge hole in the family.
It rips us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh 's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation .
'I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for, so a limited in time and scope investigation, then maybe we could get a little bit of a deal,' Flake said on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Your aversion can only be traced to timing.
The midterm elections on November 6th are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans do not do as well as expected, then they will be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their man to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits their report?
There's a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can muster at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on a tie vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors decreases under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Reunification, said that 1,127 defectors were registered last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park cited tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
The two leaders met earlier this month in Pyongyang for talks on the suspended denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work towards a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
'Without trust in the US, we have no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first,' said Mir Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but feel that a woman who would have acted in this way would have been called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and almost bursting into tears as he talked about his family and his high school days.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated smear" orchestrated by liberals who were furious over Hillary Clinton's losing 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved he couldn't serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he has declared himself unfit with these statements and the way he has been going about the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office should he be confirmed and the Democrats win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this much: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judgeship", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the federal court of appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi went on to say that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion-principle decision in Roe v. Wade, as he is seen as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
"We don't need some hysterical, biased person coming into this court and expecting us to say, 'Oh, isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of over-boiling anger and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's uncommon, do you?
She went on to say, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said that she cries when she gets angry, but she developed a technique, that when she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she was talking to, 'They might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as a vent of anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of a former job in a male-dominated office, where I was crying one day in a rage beyond description, and was grabbed by an older woman, a hypothermic manager, who I was always a little afraid of, by her collar and dragged to a stairwell.
"Don't let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're pissed off.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy with themselves because they think you're high.
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, was working with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on board the Monkey Business and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder reflected that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president himself.
"It was not a well-considered decision", she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign well advanced, she was behind on fundraising and vowed not to run unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters who donated $1,000 to the men only gave $250 to her campaign.
'Do they think I'll get a discount?' she wondered.
In the speech announcing that she would not be launching an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, her gratitude to her supporters, her frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and directly address voters instead of delegates, and her anger at sexism that she was close to tears.
"It could have been assumed that I was having a nervous breakdown", recalls Schroeder of the press reactions.
You'd think Kleenex, the handkerchief company, was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my headstone.
She cried?
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening salvoes of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts believe Beijing could benefit from a rift between the two countries in the long run.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he slapped tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way every time, recently imposing punitive tariffs of between five and ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China vowed to respond to any US action, and it's unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will stumble anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean giving in, but publicly nodding to the US would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously realized,says Abigail Grace, a senior fellow who focuses on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
The EU has also been active in the fight against terrorism, and has been involved in the fight against terrorism.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
'Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure', he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to bring back normalcy.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a decision on the conclusion of the agreement on the free movement of persons, which is to be implemented by the end of the year.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept any conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the USA.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling for much of the tournament, sank his teeing off at the 16th hole (par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5-4 by the lowest ranked player on Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't normally cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win the Cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I was able to contribute", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's passing the torch on to his compatriot John Rahm, who won 2-1 against American golf legend Tiger Woods in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, who I've been watching on TV since I was a kid", said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A curious statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been performing at a high level throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a point this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't make it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players put up a good performance.
We're going to regroup, and I'm going to talk to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were defeated.
Red tide update: concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota are decreasing
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there has been a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more erratic flowering conditions are being recorded in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating decreasing concentrations.
A red algae bloom extends for about 130 miles of coastline from north of Pinellas to south of Lee County.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer spots than last week.
A red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In the past week, medium concentrations have been reported in or off the coast of Pinellas County, low to high concentrations off the coast of Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory problems continue to be reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No new respiratory problems have been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
