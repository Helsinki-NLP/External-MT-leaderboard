I regret not following my doctor's advice.
Tom ran up the stairs.
My cat is really smart.
What do I have to do to get you to believe me?
I'd like to try it!

She was a medical student.
He ordered me to get up.
I made sure he understood.
I saw Liz this morning.
I didn't hear you.

I've been to Sapporo on business several times.
I found the missing link in your necklace.
Tom came to Japan from Australia.
Everything has an end.
Have you ever spoken to Tom?
When he was six years old, he had learned to use a typewriter and he explained to the teacher that he would not have to learn to write by hand.
I know the poem by heart.
He was fined for parking illegally.
She cut through the apple with a knife.
The killer was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.
I am an American.
Maria thought she could change Tom.
I've been enjoying painting lately.
Put your hat on!
Mama goes to the market every day to shop.
You're a freshman?
Whose toy is that?
Let's go for a walk on the beach after dinner.

She had nothing to do yesterday.
Why is the car in front of us so lame?
When she went down the slope, her old bike squeezed.
You can't expect me to think of everything!
Don't ask me that hard.

What's she doing?
He drank a lot yesterday.
I'd like to eat something easy today.
Ask her what she's done.
Something's wrong with this calculator.
I've learned French and not German.
She planted roses in the garden.
What does Tatoeba mean?
Passion creates suffering.
Where do we meet?
How did you know I liked Tom?That's what a blind man with a crutch sees!
I spoke to the boy who seemed to be the oldest.
She's taller than him.
I don't have anyone to help me.
We climbed a steep slope.
After eating a hamburger, I ordered another.
She stepped against the door.

I wish she'd quit smoking.
The machine doesn't work.
Whenever I see the stop button in Internet Explorer, I think of a Shiitake mushroom.
I'm going to Mr. Brown's house tomorrow.
The day will surely come when your dream will come true.
I turned my attention to the subject.
You're such an idiot.
Tom is looking for someone who speaks French.
Tom lived in a small fishing village.
Get on the horse.
I'm going to buy a ticket.
Bill took the blame for the damage.
A living dog is better than a dead lion.

I'd like to eat something.
There's someone on the phone for you.
Trees are planted at a distance of three meters.
When he heard that story, he was terribly disturbed.
You see a big white building back there.
She likes to listen to music.
Someone touched me.
I don't know anything about music.

Tom has his wisdom teeth pulled.
Why are you so sad?
I'm so sorry to hear that.
She saw a ghost and panicked.
I learn English for half an hour every day.
Let me be with you for five more minutes.
I speak Japanese, English and French.
You don't have to worry about her anymore.
I used to go to church on Sundays.
I regret having invited Tom to my wedding party.

When is it tomorrow?
I'd like to ask you to take care of my dog while I'm gone.
I like fish more than meat.
Have you ever been to Canada?
Do you know anyone in Boston?
I like him because he's an honest man.

There are many parks in our town.
I do sports every day.

Tom likes to go for a walk alone.
When she heard the news, she was crying.
I was able to win the first prize.
He's my classmate.
Yes they all answered without exception.
️Please open your eyes.
I'm sorry I misunderstood you!
What language do you usually talk to Tom in?
Tom has small hands.
I saw your friend here yesterday.

Tom presses Mary.
My mother is always busy.
People say the crisis is over.
I wanna clean in the bathroom. What kind of cleaning product do I buy best?
I don't know when they'll be coming.
I told my boss on the phone that I was going straight home without going back to work.
Maybe she was beautiful when she was young.
I'll give you five bucks.
The man I met yesterday's name is Hill.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong.
The teacher punished the students for using those bad words.
Can I see your license?
I don't like scary movies.
Do you think the weather will be nice tomorrow?
Tom, are you really with Maria?
Polisista aimed his gun at Tom and yelled: Stay up!
I hope you'll be well soon.
Snow reminds me of my hometown.
Both my father and my brother have a gambling thing.
He arrived on time.
She read a book all night.

I know a place that's kind of made for it.
You can't see the forest in front of trees.
You can go anywhere.

I'm often half-awake.
I'll invite you to the party.
He asked her where she lived.
Is this a 1 or a 7?No, this should actually be a 2.
She doesn't like to sing sad songs.
A housewife should be sparing.
The accident happened because of a driver's error.

Romeo can't even write his own name.
Tom and Mary get along well. They sit next to each other all the time.

I like tea better than coffee.
We should do our best.
Tom gave up his dissertation yesterday.
When she entered the room, he got up.
Thank you so much for a nice night.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Why are you learning a foreign language?
I'm riding my bike to work.
Tom lied.
to tell the truth, we got married last year.
She's proud of her kids.
I think we should wait.
The boy stayed silent.
Who is he?
Tom sat down on the couch.
How tall are you?
I was at home.
He just arrived at school on time.
I knew you'd be upset!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
actually she lied.
I'm leaving Tokyo tonight.
She was in court before the judge and jury.
I am an American.
I rely on him.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We reported him missing.
Most scientific breakthroughs are nothing but the discovery of something self-evident.
Papa, what are you doing?
Tom is definitely from Australia.
Tom isn't so stupid to argue with you.
Something so beautiful never loses its value.
Oh, thank you!
I think it's going to rain tomorrow.
You look very pale.
Tom died in a plane crash.
Tom uses the same dictionary as me.
I can't handle the inconveniences of rural life.
"How are you feeling?" he asked.
Tom woke Mary up at 6:30 am as she wished.
I like music of this genre.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Papa made me wash the car.
He built her a bookshelf.
Fugu is a delicacy in Japan.
The driver told us which bus we should get into.
The laundry is still wet.
This morning there was dew.
Tom's heart was heavy with grief.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I climbed the top of Fuji.
He was very busy last week.
I think Tom is introverted.
Do it as I told you.
Tom is joking.
Tom still remembers me?
He'll be punished.
What does this hat remind you of?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Tom and Mary both sleep like the marbles.
Tom sleeps in hours he doesn't like, sitting somewhere where the teacher can't see him so well.

When I was in Taiwan, I became friends with him.
Democracy is the basis of all free countries.
He put the key on the desk as usual.
He speaks French, and that's pretty good.
I'm not ready yet.
And I always thought taking off the shoes in the house is only done in Japan.
I play tennis for an hour every day.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She had to get down at the end of the line.
You must take bus number five.
They plan to launch a satellite tomorrow.
It's such an old song that everyone knows it.
He has a big house and two cars.
Tom forgot to ask Mary what he actually wanted to ask her.
I'll make you happy.

He's a medical student.
He told me to meet him at 10:00.

Tom prepared the dinner.
The time has come when I must tell you the truth.
I discovered that my name was on the board.
He longed for love.
Tom invests most of his salary in Japanese PVC figures.
Isn't that a little extreme?
It is the duty of the students to clean the classrooms.
If you want to survive, that means giving everything you have.
I saw him crossing the street.
She's holding a cat.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He knows more about the secrets of the sea than anyone.
Excuse me, you left your lighter on the table.
Tell me what you know about Tom!
I thought I'd answered already!
She's my older sister.
I don't like summer.
The two brothers are very similar.
I should have tried this electric razor before I bought it.
We asked him to give a speech.
You look pale today.
He drove the truck to Dallas.
I danced with the hundredth woman.

It would be helpful if she could work a little faster.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
He lives in the third building behind the post office.
Columbus proved that the world is not a disk.
I wish I had a car.
I met her on the street.
You can bring whoever you want.
Happy birthday, Aiba!
I've used my imagination.

A hostage and a fat pig are only useful after death.

I wondered if the flight time would be on time.
Can you close the window?
There is still considerable room for improvement.
What happened?
I'll do my best.
Tokyo
Who doesn't know this problem?
A terrible weather!
John is an American boy.

How come you know so much about Japanese history?
Koalas can only be seen in Australia.
John was always there for me when I needed him.

Japanese beef was on offer yesterday.
The paper says it's supposed to snow tomorrow.
He must be angry.
I took a taxi because it was raining.

"Wow! How did you get that?" "I'm a genius". "What?! Usually you don't actually say you're a genius". "I'm not normal either".

When was the last time we saw each other?
They went to the mosque to pray.
I have a mountain of homework to do today, but I haven't started with anything yet.
It's hard to keep you and your little brother apart.
Cherries are red.
Give him half as it should be!
Did you go somewhere during the summer holidays?
When I go shopping, I always end up buying too much.
She turned down our offer.
When I got home, I was very hungry.
I speak Japanese well.
There's not a single cloud in the sky.
I'd rather die than do that.
When you cross the road, watch the cars.
Where's my car?
Savlon is a cream that gives moisture to the skin.

I must get my money back.
Have you got plans for tonight?
Night always follows day.
You're ten years too young to drive a Lexus.

He's a well-informed person.
I can't lift my right arm.
I'm fixing the washing machine.
Tom cannot go.
Women are quick to tears.
Tom, do you speak French too?
She's as beautiful as her mother.
The 1990s saw a number of incidents.
He was elected chairman.

Give me that.
Tom and Mary can both sing very well.
My mom rarely watches TV in the evenings.
As long as there's no happiness for the whole world, there can't be any for the individual.
The grown man smiled when he saw Tom.
They fight.
Her father is a taxi driver.
He lost his balance and fell off his bike.
Tom speaks German besides English.
Have you got something to ship?
Oh, my God, why did you leave me?
Tom has grown fat.
She turned down his offer to support her.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary's death yet.

What are the main products of this country?
The movie scared me, and I'm gonna have nightmares about it tonight.
Send me a catalogue, please.
Is this love?
I decided not to do that today.
Half my classmates like dogs.
My brother and sister get up at about half past eight every morning.
Do you prefer older or younger, Tom?
If you're not healthy, you can't hope for success.
Don't open the door.
I think he's making a big mistake when he rejects the job.

Tom quarrels with Mary.
She's got a bad nose.
Hitler led Germany into the war.
I've been here several times this year.

I bought this book yesterday.

Tom is always on Mary's side.
Greta drank the beer on a train.
How many times am I supposed to tell you that Tatoeba isn't human?
I'm a student.
My dog often pretends to be asleep.
Tom can speak French almost as well as you and I.
Dear Santa, I wish me a girlfriend for Christmas.

Everyone hold still, they're searching their belongings.
Whose glass is that?
He ignored his father's advice.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Stop the car.
I'm sure he'll be here tomorrow.
We're neighbors.
I have more clothes than my sister.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting!
Tom fell into a deep sleep.
He kissed me on the forehead.
Don't you think you should stop doing this almost criminal job?
He'll have trouble speaking in public.
Help me with my homework.
Did you feed the dog this morning?

How's school going?
Sometimes she sits there for hours.

He was standing there with his eyes closed.
What languages do you speak, Tom?C++ and Java, plus a little PHP. And you, Maria?French, Japanese and Hebrew.
When I went to Nagoya, I was in Gifu.
He swore he wouldn't smoke and drink.
What you said only applies to single women.

I'm gonna read a book while you're sleeping.
Science starts when you ask why and how.

I found the key I was looking for.
Get me out of the front door at 7:30.
Sally is two years older than Ken.

I don't think Tom is selfish.
He arrived at the station at seven o'clock.
I have two humble questions.

I don't know what happened to him.
Did you draw this yourself?
I don't trust the doctor anymore.

️Please open the red-circled file with a text editor.
I'll be your first patient.
Help me, please.
He slept all day yesterday.
Don't know if Tom still lives here.
Give me the biggest pineapple, please.
Of course, she accepted the invitation.
I fell asleep before my father came home.
She takes care of my kids.
He was freaking out.
Fire!
I can't stand this stench.
Tom and Mary have their wedding anniversary today.
I decided not to study.

Have you washed your hands yet?

Tom has caught more fish than I have.
I want to build an igloo.
Be careful! He's right behind you!
She spoke too fast, I didn't understand.

I got your letter the other day.
Ken was home yesterday?
So I'll order it then.
You can say that.
Can I sit next to you?
Tom coughed.
Is that your pen?
I fall in love right away when men are nice to me.
I'll pay the bill.
Jane looks very happy.

Wake me up at 6:00!
There's nothing interesting in the paper.
I'm gonna lose my job.
I'm gonna miss your cooking skills.
Tom only eats fruits and vegetables.
When a girl cries, I don't know what to say.
You know that elephants have two huge ears, but they still don't understand you?
Come on, I'll listen to you.
I picked him a nice tie.
No matter how much you have to do, you have to do your homework.
The sooner I lie down, the sooner I get up.
She understands music.
Come by my place at 8:00.
I don't know if I have enough money.
I had a bad stomach ache.
If only I didn't have to take the English test.
Tom was late for dinner.
He took me to the park yesterday.
How many times a week do you bathe?
I'm a heavy burden with responsibility.
Thank you for coming.

I went fishing.
I carried some insect stings in the woods.
The war led to a time of scarcity and scarcity.

But I have a suggestion.
I'm not afraid of anything.
There's a shared kitchen in the dorm.
There's no room for doubt anymore.
Car numbers are increasing.
Chew more when you eat!
Mr. White is about my age.
March 21 is the International Day Against Racism.
I like to walk on the beach in conversation.
He only had a hundred dollars.
He left his home and never returned.

We're all breathing in a little bit.
The traffic accident happened on a federal road.
The girl has a clear voice.
Almost no one believed her.

Tom is a psychiatrist.
How lonely I am without you!
I'll take care of that tomorrow.
The wind lay low.
She had a radio.
I have nothing to do with it.
Help me, please.

Are you done?On the contrary, I haven't even started yet.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She began to understand.
There's a long way to go.
Tom arrived at the train station at 3:00.
For safety reasons, we're gonna hang a message in front of the machine.
I don't know anything about him.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Go wherever you like!
Don't you like to play with me?
Your earlobes are so big, Tom, they're sure to bring luck. Can I touch it?Finger away!
What's the difference between cabbage and head salad?
The news caused great confusion.
I'm going slow.
Tom is three months behind on his rent.

She's older than him.
There's a bank outside the station.
She begged him to stay.
He often drives his father's car.
She gave her boss a verbal report.
She accused him of being indifferent to her.
I don't want to take the shortcut.
I don't know anything about their plans.

He persisted in his opinion.
I ran ten miles.
Home Alone, happiness alone!
The teacher gave us many homework.
I want to die.

I have numerous proofs to support my opinion.
Sport surpasses boundaries
I pawned the camera.
They're swimming.
He speaks Chinese very well.
Thank you. I've had enough.
Don't leave any valuables here.
If I wanted to scare you, I'd tell you what I dreamed a few weeks ago.

I live at 337 Augusta Street.
He's a charming man.
She agreed to the plan after I made some concessions.
Tom knocked on Mary's door.
I fell asleep reading a book.
There are attempts to ban television advertising.
He bought his daughter a new dress.
When and where did you meet her?
Why were you late this morning?
I have to learn.
He was welcomed everywhere.
Here's your change.
We failed because we weren't prepared enough.
She became a policeman.
Since you're not surprised, I think you must have known.
Tom began to take an interest in snowboarding at about the age of twelve.
Tom was drunk.
Emilie won first prize in the speech competition.
Get up!
Do you want me to serve you the beer?
You'd better tell him the truth.
He had a headache.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Do you think there can be such a thing as friendship between man and woman?
Jim tends to go too far.
War and Peace I haven't read yet either.
I'd rather not talk about it here.
Don't be a jerk on the way home.
I'm addicted to television.
She lives in poor conditions.
I keep telling her to behave.

They stole my passport.
Tom was on fire.

Easter is celebrated on Sunday after the first full moon.
Birds fly long distances.

He used to live here.
There was silence in the forest.
I was excited by his way of talking.
He can run faster than me.
I like love stories.
I couldn't sleep because of the noise.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Sometimes it's important to not insist on your opinion, but to listen to others' opinions.
How is it at university?Well, it's just the way it is.Have you made some friends yet?Yes, some like that.
I'm glad to be invited to dinner.
I finished the report.

In fact, he's ill.
He's a self-centered person.
You're absolutely right.
I'm seeing Mary this afternoon.
First of all, he's an unmarried child born to an unmarried mother.
A mountain could be seen in the distance.
I wanna sleep a little more.

It's raining.
How about tomorrow night?
️Please show me how to do it.
Tom solves crosswords.
I decided to go to Boston.
I'm glad to see you again.
I'd be happy if I could be of any help.
Yesterday it rained lightly.
Tom, have you eaten?
She gave me a book for Christmas.
Excuse me, may I use your bathroom?
I can't find words.
I paid him $5

Smoking kills.
I'll make it up to you.
A lack of flexibility is an obstacle to progress.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

Please say hello to your parents from me.
We spoke in a low voice so as not to wake the baby.
When she was young, she was very pretty.
Storm caused great harvest damage.
Have you got plans for Saturday?
The meeting was closed at 9:00.
He is a hard worker who wants to succeed.
I buy very expensive things with credit cards.
She's convinced of my innocence.
I really hate dairy.
Tom has cancer.
The word "accused" is a legal term.
Tom was the last to finish the meal.

It's time for you to get up!
I woke up with a headache again today.
What is that?
Tom has three sons.
I want Maria.
You used a condom for contraception, didn't you?
I lost my ticket. What should I do?
Adolfo likes his new school, but he misses his friends from the previous school terribly.
Brother, what a cold!How surprising, Tom, that you freeze so easily!What do you mean?Who's fat, doesn't freeze?
He intends to help you.
I didn't know what to say, so I kept quiet.
I'm not like Tom.
Itō went to the United States for linguistic studies.
What do you do on Sundays?
I don't see why I should apologize.
The roses in the flower bed smell good.
She got a shock and didn't want to talk anymore.
There was still some water left on the bottle floor.
He has narrow shoulders.
We jumped into the river.
Get some sleep before I get home!
Tom wakes up at 6:00 every morning.

Let's meet at 7:30.
Do you invite guests to dinner?
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We have a newspaper subscription.
Your visit has upset him.
He's proud to be a musician.
I'm from China.

Tom reads a short story.
What a douche! The change was 256 yen smooth!What's smooth about that?Na, that's just 28!
What's the name of this river?
I'm thirsty, give me some water!
The patient is over the mountain.
Her face red.
Sam's car just disappeared.
He was carrying a gun on his shoulder.

What's coming to Nagoya?
The fire that caused this disaster broke out on the second floor of the hospital.
She's not exactly a beauty, but she's kind.
I tried to convince her, but to no avail.
DNA tests showed he was innocent.
He's an English teacher in Leeds.
Look at this.
He'll be here soon.
We call this city Little Kyoto.
The blind nurse dedicated herself to caring for the elderly.
Let's go swimming in the river.
The bridge is still under construction.

She plans to go to Europe this summer.
I don't know.
The tree fell by itself.
He wants to read this book.
I'm just jumping to go for a walk.
Are you nervous?
He'll be a good husband.
She gave him a present.

Don't come near my wife again.
At least the work is done.
It's very dark.
Why are you so broken?
I wish he were here.
Tom no longer smokes.
He went into the tub and turned on the TV.
The professor is famous for his Shakespeare research.

I asked him not to rush.
Turn off the light, please.
Why did you stop blogging?
This is the worst book I've ever read.
He asked for $5 for it.
It was a pretty ordinary party.

Who?
Bill is going to win, isn't he?
I think I've heard this song before.
I decided not to go to New Zealand, but to go to Australia.
I like to read.
Can you type with the typewriter?
Suddenly it started raining.
Why did you bring so many cough candy? You can buy them here too!Only Japanese cough candy helps with a Japanese neck!But I don't think so.
If I want to see the blue sky, I go up on the roof.
I'm looking forward to meeting you.
You're not Japanese.
The princess wears a gold diamond.
She turned her face away so he wouldn't see her tears.
You can't rely on a man like that.
I was born in 1988.
Generally speaking, boys can run faster than girls.
Tom returned home around 2:30.
Can you give me the sugar, please?Here, please.
We don't get along.
There's hardly a more precious treasure than a friend.
I decided to tell Tom that I love Mary.

I want to eat French.
I don't feel like going out right now.
You've repaired the damage.
I left the important documents I wanted to take to the company at home by mistake. Would you be so kind as to bring them to me now?
What year were you born?
Tom is not afraid of anything.
Tom pulls Mary by the hair.
Meet me at the main gate at 3:30.
Who will be the deputy?
Life is tough, but I'm harder.
I'm afraid of dying.

He's a man of action.
I plan to go to Hokkaido next month with my friend.
Tom is envious.
Tom resembles his mother.
Don't give up!
My father turns forty-five in May.

He ran out of the house.
Can you help me look for my wallet?
Her face was filled with hatred.
You don't say that often!
Only those who are ready to attack can attack.
You can walk right there.
I'm sad.
Can't you drive me home?
I have a big problem.
I waited outside thinking we might meet.

If possible, I'd like to meet you tonight.
The bakery is next to the butchery.
She came by car.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
He's digging his own grave.
️Children need love.
He wants to talk to you.
Tom and Bill reached different conclusions.
She fell in love with her new teacher.
I wish I could swim.
Tom was chasing Mary.
I bought a book yesterday.
I don't know how to make friends anymore.
I think this book is worth reading.

Suppe with spoons.
He's a friend of my brother.
Just when he saw the cop, he ran.
I was disappointed in the result.
How was work today? -Today there were many customers. It was very exhausting.
He's dying to go to China.

I don't know how to express myself very well in English.
We went to watch the turtles on the beach.
Talent alone is not enough.

If you eat that much, you'll get fat.
I'll talk to him at the first opportunity.
I saw a stage play today where a friend wrote the script.
He's overcome that emergency.
His criticism is a slap under the belt.
This is a TV.
Let's go bowling soon!

Have you ever been to Fuji?
Tom reads little.

I've been getting used to his way of talking lately.
Close the door.
Tom and Mary are both single parents.
Tom and Mary are catching.
He's got a keen eyeball, but he's very one-sided.
We named our dog Pochi.
The girl with the long hair is Maria.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Let's borrow a bike there.
You ever been to Kyushu?
I still have back pain.
Apel ripe fell from the tree.
Tom knew he wouldn't be allowed to stay.
Tom never talks about his own kids.
We traveled through South America.
Tom still can't write.
I can read German, but I can't speak it.
Look at this red building!
What does a sociological paper say?
She's an introverted character.
The young man who is talking to John is a student from Canada.

I know you've been waiting a long time, but can you wait a little longer?
I wish it would stop raining!
I decided to learn kanji.
Tom wants to go to school, even though he's sick.
Never give up on your dreams!
To avoid going to school, Maria played sick.
I was mostly unable to understand what she said.
She apologized for attending the meeting.
I barely have time.
Tom is liked by all.
Do you want another piece of cake?
Henry turns 30 this March.

We're about to break up.
The troops were completely destroyed.
There's a Mr. Brown on the phone.
What does a wolf eat?
He drew an apple.
You smoked?
He thought that room number 418, a very small room, was empty.

Tom lit a match.
Do you mind if I smoke?
Sometimes I can't help but feel.

What do we do when we fail?
She was wearing a simple blue dress.
Merry Christmas!
Why do you think that?

Do you think Tom really went to school today?
She lost her key while swimming in the pool.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I took off my coat because I was hot.
Except on Sundays and holidays, we can almost always deliver within three days.

She's cold to me.
He's not here yet. Maybe something happened to him.
You must overcome the fear of the dark.
I'm busy.
Can I ask you your name and address?

Excuse me, I'm looking for a book called "Tom and Mary".
Tatoeba requires that all sentences be equal and natural. For this purpose, for example, a French translation of an English sentence must not only be accurate so that it benefits a French-speaking English student, but also from a pattern that it is worth learning as a sentence by French students around the world.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom was overworked.
I took the train to Kobe.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Maybe I'll stay here until Monday.

Police examined their pockets.
Maria has two relationships at once.
He compared the copy to the original.
I lost my camera.
Which ones are Tom's?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Have you eaten lunch yet?
She likes to wear mini skirts.
If only you'd called me!
Let's get the car.
Which way are you going?
I think it's unlikely that Tom will be back for dinner in time.
He had his secretary type the report.
He designed the car.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm a hungry spider.
My brother goes to Kobe University.
I'd love to be back anytime.
The world doesn't revolve around you.
He disappeared in the crowd.
The children have already gone to school.
When did you buy this phone?
Election took place on May 16.
I'll ask Tom.
Stop talking about yourself!
Who is this man?
She was just washing up.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She hung the laundry to dry.
She's a student.
He speaks much more fluent English than I do.
Sometimes I salt it a little bit.
The children took their sled shoes and walked towards the frozen pond.
Tom has longer hair than me.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I have the same dictionary as your brother.
The plan ultimately failed.
We must act now.
Tokyo
Tom showed Mary some pictures of his house.
I was bullied.
She's an internationally renowned painter.
He became a famous singer.
Her heart was full of trouble and sorrow.
I'd like a fan.
The sun shines bright.
Everyone likes Tom.

I have no plans for tomorrow.
I live with my parents.
What is that?
Tom opened the box and looked in.
Do you want me to make you a hot drink?
I don't believe in anyone anymore.
Tom had to return to Boston.
Because today is the first of April, I'm not gonna lie about anything but me.
Was that an earthquake?
I got up at 6:00 in the morning.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
actually, i'm getting married before she does.
I dreamt of you last night.

When I asked him for more money, my father broke up and started yelling at me.

Have you finished your homework?
I can't stand being laughed at in front of others.
Kumi is the girl whose father likes dogs.
If I were you, I'd go home right now.
️Children should drink milk every day.
I love this chair.
I shook my head.
It was a pure coincidence that I found it.

Is it true that Tom can't drive?
She often practiced piano.
We had a math test today.

Tom went shopping in a department store.
Sometimes even a devil sheds tears.
I ran as fast as I could to catch him.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
Please complete your customs declaration form.
I read a book.
How many minutes am I supposed to cook this frozen asparagus?
My mother is not used to hard work.
Tom is the favorite of the class.
We started a serious conversation.

️Friendliness is not cheap.
Tom seldom watches television.
What is this huge building?
I fell in love with her at first sight.
I didn't want Tom to do it alone.
You think they're gonna invite us to the movie?
If you don't want to be hurt, then love is not for you.

I met her an hour ago.
Jack.
I'm sure it's gonna be a long day.
I fell down the stairs.

Did you actually find pandas at the zoo in Ueno?
I read your book. It's very interesting.
Why did you do such a stupid thing?
She doesn't admit she's wrong.
Which do you think is right?
I guess behind every thing we have to do, there's something we want to do...
I'm not going to the party.
I'm really surprised at his English skills.
I've learned it by heart.
What do you want to do in the future?
It's 7:00 in the morning.
I told my wife to buy a new rug.
He's on her side.
He went to Nara by bus.
He talks a lot.
Say me love you in French. - Je t'aime. - Thank you. I love you too.

Atomic energy is used for electricity generation.

She's been to Hawaii several times.

I thought Tom was a doctor.
I wrote her name down so I wouldn't forget it.
February has only 28 days.
Ten years since my grandpa died.

He played tennis.
Tom was caught by his mother in self-satisfaction.
Yoshio has his father's face and his mother's being.
The dog sniffled at the stick.
Tom is home now.
He took care of the baby.
I was tapping the light switch in the dark.
I'm going for a walk in a park.
This dog eats almost everything.
You have nothing to eat.
He did it, and even in their presence.
Ah, the coffee is hot!

I'm going to my friend's.
He has a family to feed.
I use Firefox.

Let's go by train instead of bus!
I told you to lock the door!
A fork fell off the table.
All their efforts were in vain.
I'm looking for someone who can speak French.

All the students cheered.
You must work hard.
I paid him $5
She supported her brother in his housework.
I hope the rainy season is over soon!

Japanese is our mother tongue.
Life is just an empty dream.
I'll report to you soon.
What's wrong with him?
She went to her room to change.
Mary wears rather casual clothes.
I left the key in the room.
Tom has been with Mary for about three years.
You don't have to apologize, Tom! I'm guilty of falling in love with you.
Ladies and gentlemen, please come this way.
The unprecedented drought led to a huge crop failure in wheat.
I'm sorry, this is supposed to be a harmless joke.

Restaurant is on the ground floor.
He's drunk and a little hooked.
I love video games.
️Sugar melts in warm water.
She's a good painter.
Are you all Canadians?

She is very careful; therefore she rarely makes mistakes.
Welcome to hell!
He has funny ideas.
Proud of his punctuality.
It's not like that.
I was surprised to see him here

Tom is in the corner of the room.
My mother hates the summer heat.
Don't lie to me!
We associate the name Lincoln with freedom.
I didn't hear you come in.
Tom is the tallest in his class.
How do people sleep on planes?
I'm busy with my homework.

Tom drives a truck.
She married a rich old man.
If the car is gone, he can't be in the office.
I'm doing volunteer work at the community center this weekend.
He lifted a side of the board.
When my mother heard the news, she became pale.
What do you want?
You think he's a good driver?
Everyone in this room is of the same sex.
The company is in the red.
We lost the game.
I had him fix my wristwatch.
There are still uncivilized countries.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom entered Mary's room.
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
I've stuck so many notes to myself that I think the notes don't make sense anymore.
I should have put on a coat.
How many times have you gone?
When he was 15, he ran away from home.
The package arrived quicker than I thought.
He's afraid of making a mistake.
He's a teacher and a novelist.
Have you got the latest version?
They elected Jean as team captain.
Tom is a university alumnus.
He risked being arrested and imprisoned.
I want to be a doctor.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Why do you speak French so well?
️Computer is up to date.
The teacher had me repeat the sentence.
Dick says, "I can swim".
She picked up the shredded plate.
Nobody's ever known that.
I'm doing math right now.
Tom thinks he's irresistible.
I'm going to karaoke with Tom and the others today. Will you come with me?
I don't want to get any older.
There was a farewell party for Mr. Jones.

We heard the news that you passed the exam.
His ideas are too academic.
I wonder if he's married.
Tell me the truth.
The dog is man's best friend.
We have a lot of rainy days in June.
I'm going for a walk in the park.
I renewed my license last month.
Do it when you have time.
He's suffering from toothache.
It's three o'clock and ten.
The old man lives alone.
She likes the singer.
Frost affected the harvest negatively.
Of all bodies with equal surface area, the one with the greatest space content is the ball.

She cut the cake in half.
The criminal came out of the house with his arms raised.
Let me see your wound.
Maria is really sexy.
Our views are far apart.
He always comes home at 6:00 p.m.
It started raining.
I've decided to have my crooked teeth straightened.
Tom answered Mary's question.
I think Tom is lying.
I have a suggestion.
It's my dream to become a pilot.
It's time to go.
Have a lovely vacation!
Are you still tired?
I am not a supporter of this theory.
You arrested him and took him to Fort Monroe, Virginia.

Tom didn't want to bother Mary learning.
Japanese pronunciation and Chinese pronunciation of kanji are very different, right?
We're going to the hotel.
He went down to the hotel.
It's time to get up.

Tom forgave you for last week?
The problem is, we don't have the money.
I finally got away.
I saw him walking across the street.
You can stay here if you want as long as you stay calm.
He pretended not to know me.
He's not good enough to be a teacher.

Statistics show that our standard of living has risen.
I speak Japanese well.
️Please wait for me at the station.
Please pour him a glass of beer.
Tom is a trainer.
He explains us in English.
Yeah, I'm probably staying at home.
Fire burned down half the city.
He's not lying.
He asked us to leave immediately.
I'll always be there for you.
He's smart, but I don't like him anyway.

He founded this school.
There is no mother who does not love her child.
Here's another line.
I mentioned the beauty of the view.
Whatever you're thinking is wrong.
I have to withdraw money from the bank.
Give me the salt, please.
Thank you so much for coming to the job interview.
He couldn't understand the sentence.
All she got for her efforts was ingratitude.

Tom is serious.
Get well soon.
I don't think Tom will like it here.
He was seen washing the car.
You got a headache?
Tom never talks about his own child.
If we miss the express train, we'll take the next train.

She was sitting under a tree.

I'm in a difficult position right now.

I have to go to Chicago.
You don't have a key, do you?
I'm Hungarian.
His expenditure is far greater than his income.

You're being rude!
I can't lift my right arm.
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.

I noticed that she was sitting in the front row.
Tom speaks poor French.
She walked all the way to Shinjuku.
️Please lend me your car.
You're not really stupid.
If you get a boyfriend, what do you want to do?

I'm in the house.
I came from the train station by taxi.
I like guys who are lively.
They exchanged greetings.
I'm dying to see that.
You have a fever?
We don't have school tomorrow.
I'm from Sapporo.
I'm playing with him.
Tom is so cool.

Let's go eat.
Alice slipped down the long slide.
Did you learn all by yourself?
Tom suddenly became very tired.
I have a great pain in the arm you hit me on.
The nurse told us not to go to the patient's room because his condition was critical.
Tom is curious.

Tom thinks volleyball is more fun than basketball.
Who do you think will win?
I don't know why they're so angry with us.
He's a reliable man.
I went aboard.
London is her second home.
Can you tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese?
I consulted with my father and decided to change the job.
The castle is beautiful.
He publicly declared himself the leader.
I'm studying Japanese history.

The public is unhappy with the current government.
He's about to leave for Canada.
I want to be nicer.

You must do as you are told.
I can't dance either.
"Miss! I forgot my umbrella on the train!" "You shake!"
Tom found Mary lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.

He looked at her respectfully.
I'm the one who has to take care of it.
Who's the girl?
He went outside despite the storm.
I'll show you the car I just bought.
I got a letter from a friend.
He's the last one to tell such a lie.

I believe it is my duty to protect these children.
I grew up in Yokohama.
Tom felt drawn to Mary.
Tom wears glasses.
Do you think every boy in your school has to learn to cook?
Are you both okay?
Wait till the light is green.
He swore to quit smoking.
I'm sleepy.
She's a beginner.
What are you doing today?
We have nothing left but to postpone our departure.
She had an unusual desire for money.
He doesn't drink enough breast milk.
When I was a kid, I was addicted to crime novels.
Tell me what happened.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
He couldn't wait to tell his friends on his new bike,
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The Government will make every effort to take into account the needs of young people and the needs of the older population in the same way.
Tom finds social interaction difficult.
Branches are for trees what arms and legs are for us.
He breeds horses and cattle.
The falling stone killed him on a prank.
He's over forty.
Middle East is the cradle of civilization.
He stayed home instead of going to school.

His views are incompatible with mine.
You'd better tell him the truth!
Tom knew everything.
Suddenly I felt a stinging pain in my stomach.
He promised me he'd be here at 6:00.
Tom and Mary left.
Have you gotten used to the new class?
How many Chinese friends do you have?
As far as I know, the rumor isn't true.
She's smarter than him.
His trembling hands tightened his calm stance lies.
I didn't say anything, but it made him angry.
There is no Japanese girl named Tatoeba.
Have you ever eaten Japanese food?
Momoe played with me more often when he was a kid.
The birds fly.
She speaks relatively fast.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Please look at me.
In judo, technique is more important than strength.
We must hurry.
Don't make a sound!
I'm giving you a local anesthetic.

Tom likes to swim.

Tom got off the bus.
Tom did that, didn't he?
I don't want to go to school today.
You're really trying, but please don't take over.

He decided to keep his plan secret.
I want some specific information.
What will become of our descendants if there is a nuclear war?
She got divorced from her husband.
What made you change your mind?
Whatever excuse he tries, I won't be able to forgive him.
You'd better get a doctor to call.
Take an example of Tom.
I gave everyone money.
Tom and Mary are both single parents.
The girls weren't afraid, but the boys.
I sent Tom a web letter, but no response yet.
The train leaves every half hour.
I'm a student.
All students trust Mr. Akai because he never breaks his word.
I had a green star operation last year.
She asked me if I knew Tom's address.
I bought this TV on rent.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is embarrassed to buy Verhinderlis.
The ball rolled into the stream.
He's two years older than me.
Tom went shopping in town.
Nancy isn't so stupid as to marry Jack.
I thought you spoke French better than Tom.
He's on duty.

Tom claims to have shot Mary for self-defense.
There were many wounded, but few missing.
Stop crying! You won't solve anything with this!
What are you doing today?
My brother has a good memory.
Paper is made of wood.
Unfortunately, the report is true.
Who discovered radium?
Tokyo is a big city.
Give me a piece of chalk.
Come on, hurry up!
What about the rash?
Get up and run faster, or you'll miss the train.

I hope you had a good trip.
I don't think it's right that you can't get a good education without money.
She died at the age of 54.
He speaks five languages.
They agreed on a price.
She didn't know what to do.
We came home later.
Have you ever seen a wolf in this area?

Tom looks very tired.
He accused me of stealing his watch.
Brush your teeth after meals.
He can run faster than me.
Tom can't take anything solid since the accident.
I'm just finishing my packing.
What you said is true for this case too.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
John is good at math.
Why are you crying?
Did I miss something this morning?
He came by bus.
I'm not feeling well.
You speak French very well.
I know you're in shock.
When we're small, everything seems so big.
She forgot to feed the dog.
I want to learn German besides English.
She wears a precious necklace.
I am busy on the one hand, and I am not interested on the other.
I wish I could live in Boston.
We ran to the river.
I felt very happy.
You should have turned down such an unfair offer.
Keep it to yourself.

The doctor took his pulse.
You don't want to go?
Even her mother tongue doesn't speak it perfectly.
How do you spell "Massachusetts"?
I am a vegetarian.
How was your summer?

We lost the race.

I don't drink coffee.
The content of the lecture covered a wide range of topics.
Tom thinks that you can get along anywhere in the world if you only know English.
Did many take time off at your work today?Not that I know.Why?
Let's just call it a day.
He can't buy a car.
Tom carried two boxes in the storage room.
Please show me your ticket.
Bus  takes passengers from the hotel to the airport.

Tom woke up when Mary was reading a book on the table.

He jumped over the fence.
Ann plays tennis very well.
I hate Mondays.
Can I have the book I lent you the other day?
How many apples are there?

I can't do anything for Tom.
Maria asked Tom not to give her any more chocolate in the form of cute animals, as she could never get over eating them.
If you don't hurry, the bank will still close. -Ah, I've decided to leave tomorrow.
She looked around the room.
He sat upright.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I'm going to bed slowly.
When do we get to Tokyo?
We meet her sometimes.
Mama made me a sweater.
"To tell you the truth, I'm afraid of heights.""You're a fear rabbit!"
There's a volcano in Iceland that's spitting out smoke.

Tom fell off the horse.
We crossed this lake with a boat.
The idea itself isn't bad.
I thought it would be hard for her to get the ticket.
It was night.
There's no point in getting mad at him.
He doesn't have to get up so early.
When you return, I'll be gone.
I heard from the boss about this matter.
I heard someone calling my name.
This dog is big.
I have a dog allergy.
I think it's really sad that he died so young.
Snow will soon disappear.
I don't know anything about her family.
I got up at 7:00 this morning.

I should have followed Tom's advice.
Please close the door.
It seems as though Tom cannot keep himself from trouble.

Can you explain this more?
He's a very smart boy.
I know you like to travel, Tom.
How old is this book?
She can't play piano.
We were proud of our strength.
She just left.
We turned on the radio.
It was his bike that was stolen.
The doctor held the stethoscope to the patient's chest.
Are you ready?
It's too early to get up.
You said I could never win?
You're hiding something!
He smokes a box of cigarettes a day.
He may have read the letter.
He left the company for personal reasons.
The wind has calmed.
Please use yourself.
Tom is passionate about music.
Please put on your shoes.
Tom is still on the phone?
The function has no side effects.
️Children play with toys.
You left the room very quietly.
She wears an expensive ring.
The wind is blowing from the west.
Don't open that door.
He had to pay a high rent for his farm.
I hate coffee.
We have a lot of rain in June.
The risk is too great.
All boys are idiots.
I don't know what to do.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
She took a taxi to the hospital.
She's a bad driver.
We shot hundreds of pheasants.
Where did you hear that?
Galileo Galilei
I'm not with Maria or anything.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We are not gods, we are just men.
It only takes two or three minutes.
Copenhagen is the capital of Denmark.
️Taxi fare will go up next month.
What do you think of this matter?
I think black hair looks better on you than brown, Tom.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The gramophone was a product of Edison's brain.
Tom is playing the C-Dur sonatas just for fun with his right raised by half a ton.
I wanna tell him something.
He spoke a bit sarcastically.
️We can't drink milk.
️We must consult carefully about the trade deficit.
I like fruits like grapes or peaches.
Have you forgotten what you just said to yourself?
Don't ask me the same thing all the time.
She's worried about your health.
You wanna sell him your house?
He ate alone.
A Mr. Smith came to see her during her absence.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I could even hear the sound of planes.
Have you got anything cheaper?
I think the news is true.
What a wonderful invention!
Tom forced Mary to give him the money.
Do you think Santa Claus exists?
Can you lend me your bike for a few days?
He walked down the street, happy to whistle.
The dog looks sick.
Chris didn't have a car.
Can you help me?
He's a strange man.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Hurry up or you'll be late.
She leaned over his shoulder.
I just finished my homework.
Why don't you come with me?
I am extremely proud of my father.
I have such a bad cough that I wake up several times a night.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
I'm used to staying up late.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Alcohol too much numbs our senses.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He put his hands in his pockets.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom said that Mary could play piano well, but I didn't believe him until I heard her play.
Tom acquired American citizenship.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Very few die of fever.
️Don't touch my car.
I'm not saying I'd like to be unhappy in love, but I like the songs about it.
He reduced himself to one cigarette a day.
I don't have an appetite right now.
He drives a tow truck.
Did you like the movie you saw yesterday?
I'll show you the city.
Tom never drinks alcohol.
I love you!
I'm seeing him for the first time.

I'd like a refund.
It's an important decision.
I'm still suffering from jet lag.
I played tennis against him.
The branches of the grazing tree do not break under the snow.
I tried my best, but it was a failure again.
You sound like your mother.
Tom is joking.
Someone stole my purse.
Post office is right outside the bank.
Recently, meat is very expensive.
What is your real intention?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The celebration took place on May 22.
I agree with her.

I wish I had a car.
Likewise, a joke that an Englishman can laugh at with tears may not seem funny to a Russian.
Tom came to Japan as a child.
She tells everyone she meets her unhappy life story.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Politicians should keep their promises.
There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand the binary system and those who don't.
Tom ran as fast as he could.
You should get a lawyer.
That's an order.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When he came in, I was just reading a letter.
Tom and Mary both sing well.
Sulfur burns with blue flame.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I know him well.
Have you finished your homework yet?
The sooner you quit smoking, the better.
Have you reached your goal?
The swans lead by four to one.
Tom is my friend.
When would be appropriate?
You can't read her writing.
Everyone thinks the same thing.
There are six hours of lessons a day.
He's been given a down payment.
Tom bought a table.
He's exempt from military service.
What do you think?
I don't like school.
I can't lie to you.
December 3rd is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Don't wake the cat!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Someone pushed me in.
Tom told me he could come any day, except Tuesday.
The company suffered enormous damage.
She's more famous than you.
He was killed with a sword.
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
What do you think of the book?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I thought it was clear that you would come with us.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I'm Japanese.
He jumped over the flat trench.
Astronomy is the science of celestial bodies.
Do you know who invented the microscope?
You can't say that.
I was cold.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Let me think about it.
Let's talk about a cold beer!
I owe him 100 yen.

I wanna know that too.
She's always making a serious noise.
Dick plans to go alone.
I'm interested in computers.
He fears death.
What's the problem, Tom?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Did you make this doll yourself?
I'm running out of patience.
I found my shoes.
Mama sewed something new to wear.
I might give up soon and just take a nap.
She dreams of becoming a nurse.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's not coming.
Tomorrow is a holiday.
Bill arrived late to school as usual.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Thank you so much for coming.
She wants him.
Yes, it is.
I like learning languages.
When the fire broke out, he was sleeping.

I have already informed Tom of my intention to stay in Boston for three more weeks.
Was the movie good?
I am a impatient, precocious man.
He's a fool to meet her again!
To tell you the truth, I'm not your father.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Britney Spears? Where is Britney Spears?
I can't do this.
I'm glad my friends tell me they're doing well.
He bought a Honda.
I wasn't on duty at the time.
Let's take a break at the next rest stop.
In the beginning was the word.
I can't thank him enough.
I'm always at home on Sundays.
Tom never said that.
He's frozen.
She was getting ready to leave the house.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Close the window before you go to bed.
I'm gonna give you a bike for your birthday.
There is no room for doubt in his honesty.
He lives in a slum in London.
I can't get to the top of the shelf.
Everything is ready.
I got on the wrong bus.
Don't get me wrong!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She calls her little sister Mina-chan.
That won't change anything.
I stared at the blood red letter, and I wondered if it was the infamous red-paper summons.
To be honest, I'm not very good with computers.
Tom took a bath.
I'll do anything for you, Tom!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Can you come a little earlier tomorrow?
The principal excluded Tom from class for two weeks.
Paris is one of the greatest cities in the world.
He speaks ten languages.
Compared to that, she's been in a good mood lately.
He found the place without difficulty.
I had a good idea yesterday.
I gave up eating meat.
The wind is blowing very strong.
Willi is the smartest of the two brothers.

A bird flew high in the air.
Where are you staying?
I met him at the airport yesterday.
He's looking for a bigger house right now.
I don't like his way of talking.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I didn't need that much money.
He jumped over the fence.
Name and address, please.
That'll be a lesson to her.
Which sport do you like best?
He was in a critical condition.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I just don't feel like going to school today.
You're not a mechanic, are you?

He was mentally ill.
Tom doesn't know for sure what Mary intends to do.
He doesn't have the talent to be an actor.
How long have you been living here?
I have more experience than Tom.
He was up late at night.
He didn't hold anything.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I'm doing pretty well.
I'm glad to see you again!
You should find someone else to help you.
Tom is a smart kid.
She went on a ten-day trip to Europe with her boyfriend.
You're the reason I'm here.
As luck would have it, I didn't have any money.
I wish I could print what I think so it would come out of my mouth like a bill of exchange!
Nobody likes war.
I'll be home by 10:00.
Snow started melting.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He was in the dark, knocking on the light switch.
Hey, what are you doing?
This is our house.
When you're sad, you can cry.
I never dreamed George would cheat on me.
Have you called him yet?
We went skiing in the mountains.
Tom doesn't have too much money on his account.
Can you just wrap the needle around for me?
I can't understand what she said.
I can't believe it's raining again.
What do you want to drink?
Tom always treats me like a child.
I intend to return to Boston.
Welcome to the Tatoeba project website.

She said she had a cold.
Her skirt is totally old-fashioned.
I owe him $100.
I'm very sorry that I made that mistake.
There's no reason why he should resign.
She started writing the report at 8:00 and finished it at 12:00.
Select a person.
He seems to be honest.
In fact, it was nothing more than a rumor.

Can you try the number again?
Dreams come true
It would certainly not be too difficult to find out who has infiltrated our system.
He tried to take his own life because he lost her love.
What are you so scared of?
Have you ever loved a man?

I hate liars.
He works as a news anchor on television.
She always works no matter how bad things go for her.
When I woke up today, I had a sore throat.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Don't you know that you're harassing the neighbors when you're still playing loud music around this time?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There is a library in our town.
From tomorrow the weather front of the rainy season will arrive at us.
I forgot to bring an umbrella.
You've changed a lot.
I'm not using the heater today.
I'd be happy if you called me Tom.
She doesn't speak Japanese at home.
I'm cold.
Many large Japanese companies depend on exports.
How was your trip?
She gave me these old coins.
In the sight of God, all men are equal.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Shut up and listen to what I'm saying!
Tom broke a window yesterday.
You should leave these two lines out.
How does he intend to compensate?
I didn't learn any of these languages.
Can I sit here?
I'd like to open an account.

"I'm not exhausted"."Neither am I"."I'm not exhausted"."I'm not exhausted".
I asked Tony a question.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He kissed her cheek.
He tied the branches together into bundles.
A man is as old as he feels, and a woman as old as she looks.
I ran as fast as I could to catch him.
He likes the new car.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's hot today.
He has good prospects of success.
Tom is popular with everyone.
He'd never seen a boy so bad.
Call me at the office.
This is sacred ground.
I caught Tom.
You never have time for the important things!
He can't afford to get married.
If you understand, please do it properly.
I need to discuss something with Tom.
You don't understand why I've been worried.
The marks he got on the English test are not quite satisfactory.
This is too sad!
Can you help me with my homework?
How did Tom endure with Mary for so many years?
Get rid of the corrupt politicians.
The weakness of this book is that it lacks persuasive force when the author, who is married himself, advises against getting married.
All tickets are sold out.
Did you know that Tom left town?
On the way home, they stole her money.
Who did you hear the rumor from?
I found his latest novel interesting.
He was punished for his lies.
Put on your coat.
She bowed and picked up the coin.
Ever since then he has lived a hard life.
He asked me who I was.
Tom organises a surprise party for Mary's birthday next Saturday.

Can you wait an hour?
I studied American literature at the university.
Get the second key, please.
What's your favorite movie?
"Why are you angry?""I'm not angry".
The sum of two plus three plus four is nine.
Tom bumped his head on the roof of his car.
The conference ended at 5:00.
Where are they?
I wish I could quit smoking.
️Great people aren't always smart.
Tom wrote a long letter to Marie, but never sent it.
That's what she said.
️Please shut the door quietly!
We all thought it was natural that the professor could speak English.
He showed me how to use this camera.
Can I borrow your bike?
He decided to go there.
Limon are sour.
Stop talking and listen!
What is PTA?
He accidentally beat me.
Can I borrow $30?
You're not supposed to kill.
She'll be there by now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He'll probably blow it all up.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
How long do you have open?

Maybe I don't like the women at all, just their voices.

It was a lovely fall evening.
I saw him running.
If you eat too much, you get fat.
Please shut up and listen!
He moved the table to the right.
Have fun at the concert!
She answered without hesitation.
Tom went to the table.
Yeah, sometimes.
In this world itself, as if he were not of this world, oh, he looks like: the moon's glow reflecting itself in the dew of the lotus.

She didn't answer.
He heard some CDs.
You won't be there in time.
Tom has broad shoulders.
I know it's my fault!
She's very busy.
Tom is the tallest in our class.
He took his dog to school.

I've won twice in a row!
You like jazz too?
She always complains about how bad her health is.
She introduced them.
Excuse me, how much is that?
She's crying.
She's tired.
Tom is a fool or something?
A boat ride takes longer than a car ride.
Tom was the first to recognize Mary's talent for music.
I'd like to make him a birthday present.

We were in danger of dying.
I arrived in Narita the day before.
Tom went to the kitchen to drink water.
Tom was miserable.
She quit smoking.
My brother bought himself a used car, so it wasn't too expensive.
You didn't know I didn't want to do this?
She's very proud of her daughter.
Through my life I contribute to nothing but global warming.Don't say anything vague! You make me happy, Tom. Do you think that matters?
The road is too narrow for cars.
I saw your mother in the library.
Do you want another piece of cake?
He went to London in 1970.
He comes to see me when.
Papa encouraged me to learn piano.
How many times a day should I feed my dog?
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
I'm tired of it.
I never saw a strawberry this big!
I had a fight with my big brother yesterday.
I'm sorry I made you a freight tractor.
I want you to love me as I am.
On the way home, I met a dog.
Dry your tears.

The play is a satire on the world of politics.
Tom needs to hear about it.
I don't know why I should apologize.
He reached out his hand to grab the gun.

If you have something to say, say it clearly!
Let's have dinner.
When I got up today, I had a sore throat.
Write your address here.
Few know how much one needs to know to know how little one knows.
Get your hats off in the classroom!
How far is it to the station?
This tastes very good.

He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
She's an angel.
Oh, the child fell asleep without having eaten dinner.
I just finished reading the book.
Tom can swim well.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Why can't we do it now?
The book is on the table.
Red circles on the map represent schools.
He kicked me on purpose.
He lost all hope.
I hope there's a karaoke dinner tonight.
Wire is used to conduct electricity.

There was a winding path through the field.
I'd like to try that.
Judging by his looks, he's sick.
I'm starting to lose my understanding of you.

This will never end.
I rarely eat dairy.
I saw a dog. The dog was holding a piece of meat in his mouth.
I'll pay the balance by June 30.
Tanaka is a friend of ours.
You're a shopkeeper.
️Don't forget to do your homework.

The bicycle is mine.
I can't believe you didn't meet him there.
I'll see you tomorrow.
His wife is French.
I can't speak French at all.
Why don't you like me?Because you're ugly!
The boy pretended to be able to read, but he held the book wrong.
The Queen visited the museum.
I like anything that's pretty.

The children want to play outside now.
I'm easily influenced.

He's up as usual.
I wish it would stop raining!
Have you eaten lunch yet?
I couldn't get up because my foot was asleep.
Paper catches fire.
He's having lunch right now.
Mama is making me a birthday cake.

Imagination is the foundation of every civilization.
We need your help.
I couldn't remove my doubts about this matter.
Why are you lying?
Everything turned black.
I speak English every day.
Can I see this?
Taro bought a used car last week.
Let's repeat lesson five.
The wholesale prices are essentially stable.
There's a sauna and a swimming pool.
When the fire broke out, he was sleeping.
Ken drove to Aomori this summer.
This is our baseball field.
So, to get into a wespennest here, normally nobody could have expected.
She returned the book to the library.
He's looking for a better job.
I'm the oldest in our class.
Tom and Mary sat under an oak all afternoon and took turns singing haiku.
I thought he was coming alone.
I'm very interested in history.
What does Tom have to say to get Mary to forgive him?
Behave according to your age.
He has a low heart rate.

The girl with the long hair is Maria.
What time do you get back?
I've been playing with my kids all day.
Hey, what are you doing?
She had a clear conscience.
I found this in the cave.
I'm a right-handed pitcher.

I didn't know what to say, so I kept quiet.
I climbed Mount Fuji twice.

️Please wait.
He used a big piece of paper to make the bags.
Close the door.
Except for a few mistakes, your essay is perfect.
I just got back.
The police are after me.
Tom looked like he had seen a ghost.
Do you mind coming with me?
He'll be here on time.
We must consider that it is fragile.
I discovered a very beautiful place today.
Tom dyed his hair.
Whoever calls now, tell them I'm not here.
I take my dog for a walk in the park every morning.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The noise is constantly increasing.
I must drive faster to make up for lost time.
I shake at the thought of it.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
I came because I wanted to ask you for your support.
She fell in love with him.
She's in a pretty bad mood right now.
She bit him.
Tom met Mary on the way to school.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The boy tried to eat with sticks.
I told her to leave at 9:00 at the latest.
Together they built a snowman.

When will you be back?It all depends on the weather.

He quit his business and retired.
That night there was not a single star to be seen.
Do you have a Tatami room for 10 people?
As the voices are reflected by the walls, it's loud in this room.
Tom can't draw as well as me.
This is my car.
That's why Yoshio got a cold.
You thought I was kidding?
I wanted to go there.
Can you put it another way?
Tom took over the family business.
I never had the chance to use it.
All three of his children have become musicians.
Tom was bitten by a horse.
Maybe I'm happiest when I play guitar.
I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
I looked around to find a mailbox.
How long does it take to get from here to there?
Let's speak French!Oh no! I'm already tired!
I just had lunch.

Tom bn Mary for his son's rude remarks.
Team
I couldn't go to his birthday party.
Tom cut the onions into small cubes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Kai's made of concrete, and it collapsed in several places.
I like to go to the park and watch the kids play on the playground.
If you're not careful, you'll slip off the required stairs and fall.
Tom was undoubtedly the smartest student in the whole school, but whenever the teacher asked him a question he wasn't prepared for, he was so nervous that he barely opened his mouth, snorting and giving something completely incomprehensible about himself.
Is he in the car?  No, he's in the car.

I don't like to sing in public.
She lives in New York.
Is he a doctor?
Check out the world map.
Thank you for yesterday.

I have a red bike.
He's unsure about his future.
Do you believe in UFOs?
They are all dependent on their old ways.
The old man is extremely kind.

Don't forget us!
She bought herself a bike to go to school with.
The two children pulled the rope until it tore.
Tom has brought me something to eat.

A housewife should strive for austerity.
She spoke with tears in her eyes.
Do you know how to open this box?
He'll be there, whatever he wants.
I get up at 7:00.
Mama, I'm hungry.

I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't commit suicide.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What are we going to do if we miss the last train?How about waiting until tomorrow at an internet cafe or something?
She's afraid of the dark.
This lady is Indian.
Tom fainted.
You can suck me.
Which thread is better, red or white?
I like going to the movies.
He came to visit me at night.
We're good friends now, but we didn't like each other at first.
All hope is lost.
I accepted his invitation.
I'm proud of my school.
She didn't know what to do.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He stood still like a statue.
That's why I'm angry with him.
They accomplished their mission.
I'm interested in French, but it's hard, isn't it? -No. French is a hundred times easier than English. -Really? -At least I think so. -But that's because French is your mother tongue, Tom.

Yoko is too weak to work.
I wanted a jacket.
Tom ate fried rice.
I like the old car better than the new one.
I gave him a sign to get closer.
The kid who plays guitar is Ken.
I only learned the truth yesterday.
Suzuki has three daughters.
In September 1972 a joint declaration was signed between Japan and China, and diplomatic relations were normalized.
Mama made me clean the bathroom.
How long would it take to swim across the river?
This dog is the mascot of our unit.
Tom is, I think, either gay or gay.
What did you do?
Tom frowned.
I'm here. What's up?
Green reminds you of grass.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Though she was busy, she came to meet me.
Do you have friends in class?
Where was he born?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Since I was at the company on Sunday, I had two more days off on Monday.
The train leaves at 14:30.
I can't understand it.
You should keep him from temptation.
What would you do if you won a million yen?
But nobody can help me.
She says she wants to change.
She was on her way to school.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I wrote him a long letter, but he didn't answer me.
One of these answers is correct.
She left me standing there for two hours.
He's afraid of death.
忙的符号是:心死死
He breathes?
Tom doesn't have a cat, but he does have a dog, right?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I don't know if I have it yet.
Mag Toshio Sachiko?
How was your afternoon?
The moon is covered by the clouds.
Maria laughed and accompanied Tom to school.
I finally got my driver's license.
What kind of song is that? I've heard that before, but I can't remember the title.
You must be tired of the long journey.
When I was a kid, I loved Tom and Mary. I read this book till I walked eight.
I'm withdrawing my statement.
I'll call you every night.
He contradicted my statement.
I'm an officer.
Sometimes he can be a strange boy.
He's been using his new car.
I have the letter he wrote.
How many eggs are in the fridge?
I wet my shoes.
Tell Tom to stop following me!
He's a very one-sided person.
The thief has reluctantly confessed his guilt.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She shrugged.
They were afraid of being listened to.
You have too romantic a view of the world.
By the time we arrive, this meeting will be over.
The policeman meant to stop the car with a whistle.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She spoke Japanese well.
The cat is black.
Ken must be home by now.
I was surprised by his words.
He was wet to the bone from the rain.
Doctors wore white masks over their nose and mouth.
Why are you taking such a risk?
The bamboo bent, but it didn't break.
Tokyo is there.
Push this button to launch the machine.
I slept the whole time during the storm.
You should take a look at the contract before you sign it.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I looked around.
I'm going to bleach the shirt to remove the stain.
Is this the ticket?
Tom only has ten minutes for his lunch.
Is that true?
I'm spontaneously deciding to do a detour here.
Don't let me down.
It's going to snow tomorrow.
Where should we go today, to an amusement park? Or should we go see a movie?
What is your impression of America?
Tom became ill due to overeating.
Can I turn off the TV?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom doesn't know for sure what Mary intends to do.
Tom's face is red.
I've been having a headache since last night and I'm feeling bad.
Can I borrow your phone?
A trip to America is not in question.
I'll send you the pictures I took today, later all of them.
Please hold still!
It's really typical of him to do something like that.
Just because someone made a little mistake, you can't just whine about it.
Ken goes swimming every day.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Papa se lève tôt.
I'll be scolded if I'm late!
Are you still mad at me?No, not at all.
Put some more pepper in it.
I got your email address from Mr. Wilder.
Tom is a coach.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We crossed the river with a boat.
We lost almost all our away games.
She's making progress.
Tom became depressed because of overwork.
He refrained from drinking alcohol.
Tom is in London for business.
I said, go out!
I'm crazy about golf.

I'm a teacher too.
I've thought about it and changed my mind.
Why did you lie?
If you flatter him, he'll do anything for you.
She didn't answer.
Are you sleepy?
I knew it would be fun today.
When did you buy this?Um, last week.
Long hair is out of fashion.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I don't know which dress is better. Red and green are equally good.
I've been working there for three months.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I told you never to go there alone!
She was joking with my sister.
For saying you wanted to learn, you didn't get far.
I saw his mother slander him.
Most of them were students.
She got up early to watch the sunrise.

I'll buy you a drink.
She demands the impossible.
I am ashamed of my son's laziness.
I gather fresh herbs in the spring field, while the snow falls down on my sleeve.
He kept lying.

I'm sorry to call you so late, but I really wanted to hear your voice.
How did you like the movie?
Can you please be a little quieter?

I plan to call Tom tomorrow and ask him for help.
The trees have begun to bud.
I negotiated the price with him.
He sat down on the chair.
I have plenty of money.
I have to go to sleep.
He agreed immediately.
Not that you just take my cake!Don't worry! I'll give you mine right away!
"Let's play tennis"."Yes. """"Let's play tennis.
What time is it at your place?
He's just an average person.
Please complete this form.
He hasn't read the book yet.
Pardon my deafness!
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm sure he'll pass the next exam.
The tie looks very good.

I wish I was there.

Tom opened the window to let in fresh air.
The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a resolution on the following:
Communism will never be achieved as long as I live.
Cook prepares different dishes every day.
Tom is from Boston, but now lives in Chicago.
You think I'm ugly?
I'd rather not take that risk.
How many times do I have to tell you?

Apels are my favorite.
I am a diabetic.
Tom bought himself a new car.
Pardon me, but how old are you?Thirty.
Tell me what!
Why did you buy flowers?
You slept all day yesterday.
I'm busy.
This is his birthplace.

I'm used to sleeping in a room without air conditioning.
Can I change the return date?

I'm not mad at you.
Tom has never killed anyone.
You should thank him.
I got the fish nuts stuck in my neck.
I think so.
The man standing outside the hotel asked me if I needed a taxi.
Are you a teacher?Yes, I am!
I'm sick of him.

I know this is important.
Hello, are you still here?
When I opened the door, there was a strange man standing there.
The car came to a gentle stop.
Hurry up!
I have to go to bed.
Can you take me there?
I can't think of the right words to express my gratitude.
It's hot.
The company publishes magazines, right?
I am not authorized to inform you of the incident.

Have you cut this paper?
How was the movie?
This is an excellent wine.
How many years have you been in Australia?Three.
Freedom, equality, fraternity is also the motto of the Republic of Haiti.
I'm going out tonight.

She opened the door.
He can swim very fast.
He didn't get a response from her.
Tom and I talked about it three weeks ago.
Tom is a German-American.
Of all the pears I've ever eaten, this is the most delicious.
Turn left.
Maria is in a book club.
I helped my father wash the car.
My daughter is only four years old.
I lost my filler.
Maybe this has nothing to do with our problem.
Go ahead!
I'm glad your sister's safe after the surgery.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?

You lost the battle.
Get in here, please.
Tom has a weak heart.
After a long time, I succeeded.
The moon came out behind the clouds.
We're not that hungry yet.
I finally want a friend, no matter who it is!
He returned home for the first time in ten years.
I'm getting tired.
I live far away.
How do you pronounce your last name?
Because I had so much to do, I didn't have time to write you a letter.
We're home today.
Have you eaten yet?
We didn't go for a picnic because it was raining.
Do you know what time it is?
She looks unhappy.
Hold your breath.
I don't like his way of speaking.
Thank you very much, Doctor.
We must abide by the rules of competition.
The coup was carried out carefully.

Mine is bigger than yours.
He's rich, but unfriendly.
We destroyed the enemy's flagship!
Tom was killed in a traffic accident.
He makes a grumpy face for his wife's waste addiction.
I forgot my book. Can I come in with you?

️We buy the material in Malaysia.
He's two years older than me.
Can she make the long journey?
Tom really managed to win?
Tom started reading.
The loss amounts to more than a million dollars.
How can I die without burdening anyone?If you die after everyone else died, you're burdening nobody.
Have you been able to find Tom?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

She's helping him.
I admired his generosity very much.


I got this bike for free.
He's riding his bike to school.
He tried harder than I did to get good grades.

Tomorrow is Mother's Day.
They decided to build a bridge.
At first I thought I was sick.
This is very important to me.

I don't have money to buy that dictionary.
Japan is not rich in mineral resources.
️This is a little book.
Tom holds a spider.

Remember meeting me before?
The holidays are over now.
Whatever you want, I'll buy it for you.
Oh, it would be nice if I could play piano as well as Susi.
Wait, someone's knocking on my door.
Tom, Mary and John were playing catch on the schoolyard.
Can I eat this bread?
They're tracking the burglar.
Who did you kill?
The couple spent a lot of money on their furniture.
I don't have a computer at home.
Do you believe in miracles?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
If you don't mind, I'll stay a while longer.
Suddenly a dog started barking.
We should have left sooner.
Tom has built himself a hybrid vehicle.
He's got it.
You'll be shocked to hear this.
Tom said that?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She plays piano very well.
Christmas falls on a Sunday this year.
I'm a beginner too.
Have you got time this weekend?
We should keep our promises.
Rain drops down from the roof.
Take care of your own affairs!
Don't be such a jerk around here. Get back to work!
Atheism and rejection of religion are not the same thing.

I have brown hair.
He's not a singer, but he sings very well.
Tom has a dog phobia.

Police chased her to Paris.
If you just sigh, you'll be left with luck.
He dyed the ceiling blue.
The accident happened suddenly.
How long have you been in Osaka?
All the students were there.
I was wrong.

I don't know what to buy him for his birthday.
Far away, you can see the Fuji.
In addition to this increase, there has been a change in the structure of the world economy.
Why are you here?
Tom is not used to walking barefoot.
In the future, I want to be a dentist.

Our daughter gets sick a lot.
Can't you drive me to the station?
How far is it from here to the airport?
You think I'm kidding?
This is my car.
Mama told me not to be so loud.
He's angry with his boss.
The key I lost was under the sofa.
All my friends have cheered me up and encouraged me.
He knows almost nothing about this problem.
You can eat as much as you want today.
Nothing can stop her from marrying him.
I wish I could play guitar better.
I'm barely on cash.
You have twin daughters.
I like apples.
We all want to live as long as possible.
I have some friends in the United States.
He's very confident.
Tomorrow is Saturday, February 5, 2011.
Tom is a post-war generation.
This is your only chance.
The old man served the king for many years.
I can't take this love sorrow anymore.
You're absolutely right about his character.

The head of the company is a very understanding person.
Tom drives the bus to work.
Can't you come by on the weekend?
Tom put on rubber gloves to avoid fingerprints.
Tom drinks six cups of coffee a day.

As soon as she finished her work, she left the office.

Tom and Mary are the same age.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm not mad at you, Tom.
Eventually we arrived at the lake.
What Tom says, don't take for granted.

I think Kate is a smart person too.
Tom went up and down the room restlessly.

If only there were no exams!
In case of fire, please turn this window on.
You can't swim here.
What's your favorite vegetable?
The train went west.
He's giving up.

If you cannot come, please let me know as soon as possible.
She has a good handwriting.
The train is about to leave.
When you encounter unknown words, you have to look them up in the dictionary.

What is he talking about?
I find the film very heartwarming.
She has a strong sense of business.
His books are almost useless.
I saw a white dog jumping over the fence.
I can prove that I'm right.

He pourboiled me with insults.
She wrote many poems.
He almost died in an accident.
When you're ready, call me.
I'll see you on the weekend!
What's for dinner?
I'm expecting a client today.
This has nothing to do with you.
Tom has failed.
He's very well known in our country.

Tom does all his homework in school.
️We use a new method to make butter.

She introduced her terrier to a dog show.
I was in Tokyo yesterday.
Ah, don't you want to switch cell phones next time?
Get up to your size!
The Prime Minister resigned yesterday.
He whispered.
Passengers must use the pedestrian bridge to reach the tracks.
I don't even remember who said that.
It was awfully cold yesterday.
Don't you want to eat something?I'm not that hungry yet.
I'm not as tall as him.
Tom still can drive?
The princess saw him and laughed.
He's exempt from the tax.
Can you please call Mr. Sawada?

He soon got used to living in the boarding house and made some new friends.
I arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
The sellers were all very nice.
A girl should not say such a thing!
A ring of smoke floated through the air from his cigar.
I love the month of Ramadan.
The doctor prescribed him medicine.
Ugh, where did I leave the key?
Can I ask you a few questions?

Tom lost both parents very young.
Tatoeba was not accessible yesterday.
When was it built?
Tom closed the kitchen door.
What are you learning?
Tom speaks several languages.
She speaks English and French fluently.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom is a man who makes the impossible possible.
I ordered six chemicals books from New York.
Mama was busy cooking dinner.
Welcome home, Tom! Welcome home, Tom!
Stay or I'll shoot.
He treats his employees well.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She invited us to dinner.
I'm going to be 16 next month.
When is school over?
What are you going to tell Tom?
Tom ran away and vanished into the fog.
I got into a panic yesterday on the way home.
But if it bothers me, I'll stop right now.
The dog grabbed me.
Tom doesn't drink beer at home.
I don't like your negligence.
I'm the only one left.
We ran about five miles.
Have you anything else to say?
She was at the crime scene.
The Russian language has six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental and prepositive.
I think there's not a single thing in a person's life that's pointless.
We're going to have to.
Yeah, you did good.
She's just starting to play the piano.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I think we should call the police.
How was the test?Not as hard as I expected.
He can speak and write French.

He turned red with rage.
The jacket I bought the other day is now on sale for half the price.
Tom doesn't like cheese.
We played and laughed.
I'd like to pick a present for my girlfriend.

Tom studied French yesterday?
How are you?
I'm very busy.
Tom has three French dictionaries.
Who else am I supposed to trust now?
Wait till morning.
I have to go to this meeting now.
He still loves her.
I spent 500 bucks a day.

He's a man who doesn't take into account.
Finally his wish was granted.
Tom is dedicated to the study of quartz.
The mountain top was covered with snow.
I love you more than anything else in the world.
Please speak slowly!
There's someone at the door. Look who it is!

She has a soft heart.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
Why are you so broken?

Mama made money sweating her face, so you can't spend it on unimportant things.
Maria wore a navy blue skirt.
I like to play golf.
I quit smoking a year ago.
I was lonely, since I had no one to play with.
I thought you had such an opportunity to improve your French.
I'm busy right now.
She fell and immediately broke out in tears.
Feed the bird!
He speaks English, but also French.
The train left the track.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When did you confess to him?
He's proud that his wife's a good cook.
Both my wife and I grew up in Boston.
The boy over there is my son.
Make your bed.
He insulted me and called me an ass.
I just got to the station.

I don't want to hear your mourning anymore.
He dug a hole with his spade.
You drank two bottles of wine.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Too bad to throw it away.

I don't feel like going out tonight.
Never heard him complain about the food.
Tom regrets giving Mary his phone number.

We have a test tomorrow.
She took back the coat she lent me.
The moment he saw me, he ran away.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Be wrapped, millions!
There's a beautiful river across the park.
It was just a joke.
Tom swims.
Now they have three children.
What do you want to eat?
The blade of my knife is very sharp.
I'm going home now that it's late.
I left my pen wallet at home.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's strawberry time.

The gang pushed him to the ground and stole his watch.
He lives in a mixed Japanese-Western house.
I'm out of money.
Tom felt very lonely.
He greeted me with a smile.
Tom is cooking me dinner.
Tom hasn't told Mary yet that he's been fired.
I'm sure your plan will work.
He's calming you down.
Can you close the door?
Have you ever been to Italy?
As soon as I left my home, it started raining.
There's no way out.
Whoever says that is a liar.
I had an umbrella, but my friend didn't.

The meeting ended at 9:00.
He got used to smoking when he was young.
I have a blue eye.
I think you're absolutely right.
Shut up, he whispered.
Now calm down!
I watched the game from start to finish.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Are you done with the task?
He disappeared in the crowd.
He seems so strict to me, but he's an incredibly nice person.
He says he has to go to Vienna the day after tomorrow.
Please connect me to Mr. Smith.
He was injured in the accident.
He put his arm around her waist.
When he was five, he suffered from childhood paralysis.
Tom likes oranges and eats three or four of them a week.

I had a headache so bad, so I went to bed earlier than usual.
I owe my uncle $10,000.
Our principal is American.

I didn't feel like playing golf today.
I avoid air travel if possible.
He'll get to the tree without any trouble.
She made a hole in the balloon.
There's a cat in the kitchen.
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Our opinions differ on this point.
Draw a circle.
She was almost run over by a truck.
To save the Earth, we must all do something.
She doesn't speak Japanese at home.
Though he is rich, Tom has hardly any friends.
Tom says he still has stomach pain.
Please do it again.
I don't know him.
Maybe the new boss is a little more tolerant than the old one.
Ten years have passed since my father died.
I think he's being honest.
Do you trust her?
Who owns this?
And what are you trying to tell me?

We ran into each other at the train station.
Tom had already taken Mary home with the package.

Do you play any other instrument besides the piano?
Suddenly, a man outside heard a gunshot.
Tom wanted to lose another two kilos before the summer holidays.
Thank you for inviting me!
I arrived too early.
He's not as smart as his big brother.
I will do my duty with pleasure.
She accused me of being a liar.
Smoking is harmful to health.
Have you ever lied to your friend?
Tom opened the safe.

He got sick on the way.

Please keep telling me!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Storm caused terrible damage.
He lived here for two years?
Can you fold the laundry for a minute?
Maria found a long blonde hair on Tom's jacket.

How to create an e-mail address?
I think I ate something bad.
There are, if any, few mistakes.
You look really nervous.
I'd like to ask Tom.
The fire is extinguished by itself.
He just got to the last train.
I'll come back later to meet you.
He's afraid of death.
My grandmother is very old.
She bit him.
I slept very well last night.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Have you ever tried to talk to her about it?
Then, this way!
I quit smoking.
The election results will be announced tomorrow.
For today, that's enough.

I'm faced with this problem.
Have you lost some weight? Have you eaten enough?
The sky is clear almost every day.

He insisted on his opinion.
She's got a character like you.

Do you want a T-shirt?Yes, I want a red one.
I saw him on TV sometimes.
I like to play tennis and golf.
He told the truth.
I can't sleep at all.
We checked him until he was out of sight.
He's got a tendency to get upset about the little things.
"Yes, okay", said Mrs. Lee.
I'm very happy.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

What are you doing today?
Tom cannot keep Iraq and Iran apart.
The document was signed by him.
Did you go to school yesterday?

He's writing a book.
Do you speak English or French more often?
Cut the cake with a knife.
Why are you always late?
I don't think you could call my appearance or my voice cute.
I can't do that.
He's in the kitchen.

Can you show me the book?
She was sitting on the bench.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm kind of sad when I think that tomorrow is the last day.
Immediate action is necessary.
I have nothing to do with this matter.
I can't take a single step.

Tom is quite knowledgeable about modern entertainment music.
Black smoke came from the chimney.
Bus stop?
Whatever happens, you gotta stay calm.
Tom is a friend of mine.
He was sitting on the bench smoking.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Hurry up or you'll miss the bus.
I allowed myself to call her.
From February next year I'll spend a year studying in Australia.
Tom ought to apologize to Mary for not arriving on time.
He left the door open.
Tom saw a triple rainbow.
You tend to let things go.
When she was young, she liked coffee better than Japanese tea.
You must finish this work before the deadline.
Maria is neither my friend nor anything else.
He has so many books that he can't read them all.
I'd like to see the scene in real time.
I love music too.
We call our dog Pochi.
I'm going to take a shower.
They were all surprised to see me there.
Berlinale 2017 was inaugurated on February 9.
Tom is my big brother.
A fish can swim.
Excuse me, but can you tell me how to get to the station?
That's really nice of you.
It was raining.
Can I get the baggage for you upstairs?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom threw a snowball at Mary.
What do you want an old car for?

Let's split the money!
It was very nice today.

She's an alcoholic.
I should have rubbed myself with sunscreen.
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
The meeting is held annually.
He's a classically educated man.
Mary must always tell others what she thinks.
She's a famous poet.
The plane hasn't taken off yet.
Except for Mike, everyone showed up at the party.
She's not pretty at all.

Tom got a call from Mary early this morning.
What's your best friend's name?
Enjoy life as long as you can!
I'm cold.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom, where have you been?
We had a secret meeting.
Why did you buy flowers?
Tom
You're not alone.
She's drawing a picture.
I'm going to do a sketch of my new website.
He can come.
I'm giving up.
Please close the door.
I'm sorry I ruined your plans.
How much is it?
I can't stand him because he always gets angry right away.
The data are often inaccurate.
So far, so good.

He came in with bright eyes.
Can you leave a message?No, thank you.
Two kids playing in the park.
Tom does not believe in the theory of evolution.
I like dark red.
I am a Muslim.

I saw them crossing the street.
He pretended not to listen.
She bought him a sweater.
He's still alive, I hear.
The speaker was a little nervous.
Bill lives near the sea.
I don't feel like going out right now.
Are these all Tom's books?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom fell off the boat and got lost.

Can I turn off the TV?
I didn't have more than 1,000 yen.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There's a ghost in the house.
The rabbit had no special skills, so he cared for the old man with sacrifice.
This is something else.
I lost my ticket.

If I'd known I was gonna get photographed, I'd have worn something better.
I'm not that tired!
She felt sorry for the orphan and gave him some money.
What do you know about Israel?
I'm dying of hunger!

I'm a student.
I'm sorry, I forgot about that.
Tom always brings rain.
"Have you ever been to New York?""Yes, I've been there a few times".
He's tough, but he's actually a very good-natured person.

There's a customer parking lot.
The girl with the long hair is Maria.
Since his appearance has completely changed, you probably won't recognize him.
We saw nothing unusual.
Tom turns Mary off because she didn't tell him she was going to be late.
Ann, by her nickname.
Hello, can I speak to Mrs. Ogawa?

My sister is older than my brother.
Jane prefers dogs to cats.
I made the film myself.
Tom has a beautiful wife.
I want him to go there.
The problem is caused by the lack of communication between the departments.
Tom shouldn't have done that.
Nothing is as precious as love.
The current imbalance of supply and demand is not seen as a cyclical phenomenon but as an effect of the structural change on the demand side.
Fire is burning.
Iron is harder than gold.
️We don't offer currency exchange.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What does this paragraph mean?
Mama forgot to salt the salad.
We were planning to leave Boston in the evening.
I don't know you.

X in mathematics usually represents an unknown size.
Everyone wants to sit next to her.
The train left at exactly five.
Turn on the light.
That's exactly what I wanted.
I'd like to eat something easy today.
The vase shattered into a thousand pieces.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Do you need a lot of money?
Tom left Mary some food.
I can't save anything because I'm unemployed.
But he can't enjoy hot summer.
He's being rude.
Radio
Thank you very much! I don't even know what to say!
Tom says he's a believing Christian.
Let's hear the tape.
I've never been to Hiroshima.

Talk is silver, silence is gold.
Don't you like it when people say you're cute, Tom?
I want to call Tom tomorrow and ask him to help us.
He gets up early.
The plane that crashed went up in flames.
Get to a high-altitude place and be safe.
She took a taxi to the hospital.
This is dangerous!

Did it rain yesterday?
The report exaggerated the capacity of the hall.
Sawako wants to go to France.
Uncle Tom is my mother's brother.
I don't think anyone else is coming today.

He's French.

He made a considerable contribution to economics.
The teacher read a paragraph from the Bible to the class.
The Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico.
He threw a stone at the dog.
It's cold.
I also sometimes think that I can try as much as I want and it just doesn't work.
I think I can understand Tom's feelings.
Don't talk like that brain-burned trash!
She's very busy.
Now I can tell you, I was in love with Mary.
They all started laughing at me.
Tom seldom comes late.
Can you do me a favor?
He's gone off the grid.
I don't know exactly where I was born.
Tom does not drink alcohol at all.
From there I saw the accident.
He drinks a lot.
When did you go to bed last night?
That's interesting.
He accidentally listened to the conversation.

He hung up his coat.
When we broke up, he said we'd meet again the next day, but I haven't heard from him since.
The young professor is the flock of female students.
I'm not a magician.

He's not fit for this important job.
Her father left us last week.
We drove up and down the elevator.
He works for a living.

What do you see in me?
I want to be stronger physically and mentally.
I don't want to do that.
He's very confident.
She encouraged him to write a novel.
She was bored with country life.
How many shots am I supposed to make?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I think he's gone home.

Tom is following me.
How much sugar do you use?
This is indeed the room where I first met my wife.
No, I mean, yeah.
I saw a figure coming from a distance.
I care about it.

How was the test?
How many times a week does the football team practice?
I was out of the house at the time.
Don't bother me learning.
Tom wrote down Mary's words without a single exception.
Tom couldn't quit smoking.

He built a new house.
But since I met you, it's been worth the trip to Waseda.
I didn't go out to get a cold.
The villagers built a wooden bridge over the river.
He was extremely happy.
I got up around 6:00.
He has a habit of reading the paper at dinner.
You still trust him after he broke his promise twice?
There is peace between Japan and its neighbors.
What do you want to study at university as a major?
Don't let the dog in.
I had to walk because there were no taxis.
She's younger than him.
, this is Tom.
He was torn from his sleep by noise.

She declined my request.
It's a long way from here to Tokyo.
Rapid delivery, please!
She played the violin.
Someone was laughing.
Are you ready to leave the house?
Don't yell around like that early in the morning!
I was shocked by the news yesterday.

This is an old book.
I hate confident women.
Shinano is the longest river in Japan.
I'll let you know when she gets here.
I eat breakfast every morning.
Write him a letter now!
They drove to the coast.
I can't understand anything from loud noises.
The latest comics have too many violent and sexual scenes.
I met Tom on the way.
I was bullied.
I don't have enough work memory.
You don't speak German, do you?
You must record his speech.
Come by anytime!
You should have spoken more politely.
Don't you feel hungry?

Tastes?Yes, it tastes.
You all right?
He was in a hurry to get the train.
The realtor lied to the couple.
He has a remarkable memory.
I ate a burger, then went to bed.
The ice broke under the weight.

Matsutake
I didn't know what to say, so I kept quiet.
I want a guitar.
He can speak a little Chinese.
There are millions of stars in the universe.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
If you want to improve your swimming skills, you have to practice daily.
He had a strict expression.
I can only wonder if it's the same for everyone else.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's young, but he's thoughtful.
Tom is being bullied by Mary.
It was a good thing for her that her husband arrived at this moment.
I'll take another look.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The car I rented from you is defective.
You called.
Maria is older than her husband.
I sat next to John.
The rose there is very beautiful.
I gotta take the bus wherever I wanna go.
I don't have any siblings.
She's always thinking about making money.
I've been busy all day.
I'd rather have meat than fish.
Tom got home early yesterday.
I had doubts.
Tom chased Mary.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
A bow without an arrow is useless.
Mary pretended to be sick so she wouldn't have to go to school.
Black matter absorbs light.
Tom is a professional baseball player.
Do you like black cats?
As far as I know, there is no such function.
You tend to forget things.

The result was rather disappointing.
What are you looking for?

Iron is a useful metal.

I had to teach my uncle.
How was the test today?
What was the reason for you to start an English conversation?
There was a pretty girl in the village.
Soon it will rain.
The rain wet my raincoat.
Valencia is the third largest city in Spain and is also known as the origin of the Paella.
I like science fiction.

Nothing really matters.
The comedian is very funny.
A present for you.
I decided to go out despite the bad weather.

I haven't seen you in a while.
If I had more money, I'd have bought the pencil.
Rex was a dog-like creature.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
I thought you might like a game of chess.
I didn't think I had to do this Tom said.
Tom handed Mary a glass of red wine.
He doesn't have to go to school.

Let's open our books on page 156 and start today's class, said the teacher.
Tom takes Mary in his arms.
There is no limit to human progress.
I believe in the immortality of the soul.
Is there any evidence to convict him?
I was born on October 10, 1972.
Tom and Mary made a honeymoon to the moon.

I heard her singing in her room.
The bullet hit above the knee.
He was running up and down his room all the time.
We must leave tomorrow morning.
There are happy people, and there are unhappy people.

I was very tired.
I wish it was tomorrow.
Excuse me, where do I find the eggs?
Talk slowly and clearly.
I might be late.

He doesn't seem to be breathing.
️Painters like Picasso are rare.
Have you ever sung in front of people?
I want to go to university.
He went to school even though he was sick.

He still comes to visit me.
There's no room for doubt about his guilt.
He moved to my neighborhood.
Do you think Tom wants to go to Boston with us?
She spent the whole afternoon cooking.
He has two daughters.
Maria was caught on the way home by a stranger on her breasts.
Open your heart.
He doesn't want to marry you, he wants to marry her.

You've been married for twenty years.

"Beautiful" and "Ugly" are relative expressions.
I don't know what that is.
Japan imports various raw materials from abroad.
How old is Tom?
Naruto How far down do you have it?
I burned my finger cap.
You should have asked him how much it cost.
She woke him up.
Mahjong
He's bound by his promise.

The phone was more expensive than I thought.
Jack was the one I met yesterday.
You can't rely on what he promises.
These are my CDs.
I don't know much about him, but when I see him, I say hello.
He'll be back soon.
He translated for me.

Tom hates you.

️We'd like a double room with a bathroom.
I went to her house, but she wasn't there.
He plays golf.

Unfortunately, fulltime employment cannot be taken for granted.
What do you like better, apples or bananas?
I put the bag either next to or on the chair.
He's healed.

He wants to compete.
Ah, I didn't know that.
Tom likes to eat Italian.
The video is the most wasteful!
He joined the club last year.
The flowers in the garden are beautiful.

I'm in London.
There were many people at the concert.
I was so tired, I just sat there and I got stuck.
He didn't wear the same clothes yesterday?
I don't need it.
You must stop gambling.
I have many flowers.

He lived alone in the woods.

I hit the beak and was surprised by the smell.
Social customs vary from country to country.
Always watching his kids' behavior.
A wild dog trampled our garden.
A lot of fish died.
She only met him the other day.
I have nothing to give you.
I didn't know where it came from.
Despite their protests, he left.

Can I know why?
He hung his coat on the hook.
I didn't know what to say, so I kept quiet.
Tom drowned in the sea.
I'm going to check my calendar.
I plan to visit London next week.
I love the month of Ramadan.
Close the door when you go out.
From the plane, small hills look like flat land.

The ship had hoisted the American flag.
When I was a student, I spent a semester abroad in England.
Whatever happens, you can't change your plan.
Tom often plays tennis with Maria after school.
The train left at exactly five.
He fulfilled his wish.
Have you seen him before?
Ten years since I came to this city.

I like watermelon.
I don't trust him anymore.
Mama, can I go swimming?
Why don't you turn on the light?I just didn't feel like it.
Ellen doesn't speak English.
Nice to meet you too.
Which tie do you like best?
I'm looking for the way to the end of the universe.

Tom was obviously in love.
He's a man with a bad heart.
I wanted a jacket.
She's dressed well.
There is an urgent need for improved living conditions.
Tom went into the room.
He sat down.
He punched me on the shoulder.
The two clubs joined together.
I've been doing a thorough search.
He fears his own shadow.
It's entirely up to you.
It was handmade.
You live in the area?

The girl is afraid of dogs.
Don't push it too far.
Tom hid under the bed.
Tom slept.
Tom and Mary live with their father in Boston.

Tom drew his sword.
I've been working harder than usual, and that's why I'm getting tired.

He couldn't swim because the weather was bad.
The cheesecake tasted too sweet.

Takeshi came, but left soon.
There were also people who thought the jury didn't make a wise decision.
He left for London the day before.
Tom reads a novel.
Thankfully, the fire was extinguished before it caused any major damage.

Papa goes for a walk every day.
I hope you can come to the party.
The hill was covered with snow.
She takes care of her old mother.
He put into practice the plan he had carefully drawn up.
I got sand in my eye.
Why is he here?
Have you made a choice yet?
You can't stop the time.
The monkeys are lying.
For the sake of goodness!
He held his breath.
She wears a beautiful watch.
Is she home?

She's eight years old.
Was it foggy yesterday?
There's plenty to eat.
He made full use of the furoshiki.
️Don't always be a party for Tom!
He had worked for a law firm for six years.
Tom has been working here for how long?
The air is a mixture of gases that we cannot see.
Papa quit drinking.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There are more stars in the sky than I can count.
Here's a yard cloth.
Tom put butter on the bread.
Cover the seeds with a little soil.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
We walked down the street.

He beat her feelings with feet.

Please close the door!
I hope you'll be well soon.
I thought it was raining.
I'd rather be a bird than a fish.
He had no doubt that Ben was in any way connected to the crime.
December 24th is Christmas Eve.
Leave it to me.

Don't be so hard on yourself.
How is Tom?
The bird was looking for bugs.
Tom is a bigot.
"Who is it?""It's your mother".
️Please let me know.
I don't agree with you.
This is my return ticket.

He went to eat.
He's not a kid anymore.
How old do you think she is?

Don't lose your temper, whatever he says!
She was a student at Yale.
They stopped talking.
Can I come under your umbrella?
Good morning!
I don't want to be pathetic, I want to be cool!!
He met a friend on the street.

The tape recorder recorded his voice.
This is the boy named Tom Fischer.
It's interesting.
Courage is an excellent virtue.
What happened happened.
I'm gonna shoot him.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I brought rice broth too.
Oh, just listen, a spear! And from the meadow the trees rain the leaves.
Wait till morning.

I had a stuttering last time.
You'll feel better.
He's a man of action.
What do you think of the United States?
You fought for your country.
I'm Japanese.
I went to the zoo yesterday.
Mama, hurry up!
He's just an amateur.

I listened to her story.
Yamada gives us lots of homework every day.

I didn't think she was in the hospital.
You'd better quit smoking.

Miho was in the living room when I visited her.
I met him three years ago.
I'm a student at the University of Hyōgo.
Don't you dare contradict me in the form again!
Nothing is more regrettable than losing in the final.

I'm not a doctor.
Your dog is here.
Although she can sing well, Maria rarely gets the chance to show it.

Tom is great.
I had to stay in bed all day.
When did you go to bed last night?
Both parents are still alive.
You'd better tell him the truth.

They say Ann is their leader.
She expressed her gratitude to all who supported her.
I want to talk to Tom again.

Tom currently lives in Switzerland.
The hilly landscapes of Austria reminded Mr. Bogart of "The Sound of Music".
You sent me a sample according to my request.
When you talk about the devil, there comes Katie.
They believe that the soul is immortal.
I like dogs a lot.
He earns three times as much as I do.
I'll discuss this with the superiors.
Put the meat in the fridge or it'll get bad.
I only have 10 books.
Tom walks to school.
Spirit can take possession of humans.
I was born in Osaka in 1977.
Tom is a friend from high school.
When was the last time you had your hair cut?

I gave him a book.
Maria bought this skirt yesterday.
When I was younger, I should have learned more.
"I have terrible toothache". "Then go to the dentist right away".
I'm really excited!
He was vulgar.
He yelled at me angry.
Her eyes are laughing.

Is there a cat under the table?
I think you're being honest.
Can I borrow your dictionary?
I don't know how to answer that question.
Rose is called the queen of flowers.
John is at the airport.
I asked my teacher for advice on my next career.
Her mother is not as old as she looks.
I'm going to look for Tom.
You think my job is easy?
The man reading a book right now is my dad.
Johann is already at the station.
I am not ashamed that my father is poor.
Always eat his breakfast here.
Maria already wants to marry Tom, but she doesn't dare to take the last step.
There are certain foods that can make you thirsty.
The problem is that the child has been overly harassed.
Have you ever driven a sports car?
I gave up following fashion.
He looked up to the sky.
I called him.
My sister cries often.
Table manners vary from country to country.
Tom often misses class.
You won't regret it.
No, thanks, I'm tired.

Nanu, haven't we been here before?Voice. We're back here.
I tried to write with the left.
I was at the museum the other day.
It's better not to tell Tom about it.
There are two women in his life.
I'd like ice or water ice.
The pirates had no choice but to surrender.

Were you at the library yesterday?
Paris is one of the greatest cities in the world.
I'm looking for my camera.
I'm sorry I got lost.
She tried to put the earring on her ear.
He's fully healed and can work again.
How long has she been ill?
The man sitting over there is a famous musician.
She was wearing a nice dress.
I have a headache.
I called her right away.
You can tell a person by their friends.

I'm pulling my hat on you, Tom.
Tom read the paper in his sleeping suit.
How long have you known him?
This is none of your business.
He acted very foolishly.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Bob can drive too.
He talks like he knows everything.
Try it again.
What's his name again?
He went to Paris at the end of May.
I can't help but laugh at your stupidity.
Mr. Brown is our English teacher.
Are you teachers or students?
He's ruthless.
Rather than leave my name in history, I'd rather live happily ever after.
Go wake Mary.
Oh, look at that!
Whales are counted among the mammals.
It is not necessary that Tom know this.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Of course you are!
As soon as he saw me, he ran away.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I sweated under my arms.
Tom will definitely not be fired.
Don't be mad at me!
Japan has about one hundred and twenty million inhabitants.
Do I have to take my shoes off here?
You're not cold?
Jack was born on the 10th of August.
I'm not sure she'll recognize me after all these years.
Tom was completely drunk.
Get on your good shoes!
There are only 5 days left until the summer holidays.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I had to accept his insult silently.
She became happy.
They died one by one.
Their lips met.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Machines replace much of human work.
I lost the borrowed book.
This is the height of folly.
Tom, get me the soy sauce over there!
The bridge is safe. You can drive it.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The woman sleeps in the bedroom.
Why do you love a dumb goose like me?
She sent me an urgent telegram.
I almost missed the plane.
Tom tried to save Mary's life.
I'm not a bird, but I'd like to be one.
This is gonna be a kid's game until Tuesday.
Tom and Mary lived in Boston for a while.
She wanted to live a more relaxed life.
What are you waiting for?

This is a picture of my family.
Even if it rains, I'll be leaving tomorrow.
Please stop crying!
Alex has how many cars?
He got off the train.
️I didn't know what to do.
The prince and the court fool had much in common.
How well do you know Tom?
Can you see a ship on the horizon?
Do you know when the musician will be here?
Go to the barber and cut your hair.
Don't touch my stuff again!
Can I take a picture here?

Can't you see the clock?
He was a thoughtful and gentle man with an excellent sense of humor.
You don't care about the dog.
Do you believe in ghosts?
She made a sad face.
You look pale, so get back to bed.
I hear it's haunted in the old house.
He dressed as a woman.
I'm thinking too much these days.
I'll drive you home.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Don't lie to me.
The earthquake was a disaster the country had never experienced before.
Tom must go there with Mary.

I cut down a cherry tree.
I thought you might be kidding.
I solved the problem.
She's dealing with the problem.
Who has much wants more.
It's bedtime already.
He fixed the clock for me.
I think she wants to show off her new dress.
You have rings under your eyes.

Beautiful!
Have you got anything to write?
What time do we leave?
He's not open to his employees.
He's got a habit of getting up when he's angry.
You should have done it earlier.
Greta drank the beer on a train.

Don't lie to me.
John built a shelf.
He explained the way to the business.
Tom could be killed by lightning because of me.
He left his home country two years ago.
Turn off the lights before bed.

You're right in a way.
Do you want some more cake?
You're the reason I'm here.

Tom said nothing.
He's a bank clerk.
He's got a cat.
Luxus and comfort are not the same as happiness.
I'd like to eat something easy today.
I handed him the microphone.
I'll be in England in a week.
Tom lost his memory.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You're both really nice.
Tom has blown out the candles.
Have you ever been a teacher?

I built the machine.

Where's my phone?
I'm thirsty.
Let's meet again in a year with a smile on our face!
She can speak Russian.

You don't have to worry about her anymore.
I am faced with an extraordinary risk.
This is totally impossible.

Tom wanted to put a cigarette in a match, but because the match was wet, it didn't ignite whenever he rubbed it.
Have you made a decision yet?
Tom asked Mary to meet him in his office tomorrow.
We arrived at the same time.
I go shopping every other day.
You must pay in advance.
She bought her kid a toy.
The lid of this box cannot be opened.
The guy is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
Why do you think so?

Where are the eggs, please?
I'd like to speak to the manager.
You set a bad example.
The difficulty of the Japanese language prevents foreigners, except for a handful, from approaching Japanese literature in the original language.
It's sad, but true.

I plan to stay in town.
Tanaka is our friend.
️Proposer yourself.
When she was kissed, she panicked.

Let's leave early.
All roads lead to Helsingør.
I thought you wanted to stay home.
What time is it now?30?Oh, my lord! I wanted to go to bed earlier today!
I've been in Japan for ten years now.

I meet Tom every day.
There are times when a man must fight and give his life.
To do that, you have to take risks.
He likes geology and history.
I've located the city on the map.

Mama doesn't like me watching TV.
Paul is such a nice guy that everyone likes him right away.

sushi or zen are examples of Japanese borrowings in English.

The surface of the object is rather rough.

In her free time she plays the piano.
Turn on the light!
I need to charge my cell phone.
It's not certain when he came here.
She gave me a tie that suited exactly my taste.
Where does he live?

He was lucky.
We eat three times a day.
Tom is the best in his class.
I'm going to have to go slowly.
The author does not show any exceptional talent in the book.
When I look at these photos, I think back to the holiday season.

The trip will cost somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000.
The two lovers sat opposite each other drinking tea.
Welcome to Boston!
He was born in the 19th century.
Tom was absent from the meeting.
Tom was in danger.
When was the last time you took a swing on your bike?
I should have kept my mouth shut.
Talk to him is like talking against a wall.

Is that Tom's daughter?
The first one wasn't the best.
Can you stop talking about food?
Nobody came near him.
Fibonacci numbers are a common occurrence in nature.
Don't forget to drop the letter tomorrow, okay?

I'm gonna play football tomorrow.
We postponed the event.
I wrote him a long letter.
I saw a strange woman there.
Was it cloudy in Boston yesterday?

I enjoyed talking to him.
He showed his new watch.
I've been looking everywhere for my lighter, but I couldn't find it.
She was sitting on a bench.
We're all breathing in a little bit.
I'm calling from my cell phone.
He has enormous knowledge. In other words, he's a changing lexicon.
He realized he couldn't keep working.
I don't think it's worth the trouble of studying.
You mean I killed Tom?
Was the movie interesting?
She always wears fashionable clothes.
I love you so much, Tom!
Please submit your report by the end of the month.
We've been involved in a car accident.

The chimney started to smoke out.
I don't have a friend to talk to.
A noise woke her up.
I'd rather go today than tomorrow.

He might be on the next train.
When the singer entered the stage, the audience broke out in cheer.
Have you got something planned for Saturday?
Are these all your books, Tom?
I can run faster than Ken.
Her eyes darkened.
Your cell phone just rang.
Please close the door!

What's new?
Show me!
Have you made any new friends yet?
Unfortunately, fulltime employment is no longer a matter of course.
Have you read the editorial in the newspaper this morning?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I'm not interested in modern art.
I think the ship will cross the equator tonight.
Can he say something like that?
I'm having coffee.
Don't know if Tom did that.
I made a mistake.
As he was considerably late with the rent, he was thrown out of his apartment.

I have a splinter in my finger, but I can't get it out.
Tom spoke to you about Mary?
The houses are big.
The devil destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
If you speak like that, they'll think you're an idiot!

They were all surprised to see me there.
I'll pay for it.
I finally got the shot out of the Kendo.
Tom has longer hair than me.
Tom got off the train.
She was so nice to lend me money.
I don't speak Japanese.
We complimented her for her meal.
I needed three hours for my homework.
We eat between 7:00 and 7:00:30 in the evening.

You must think of some excuse.
We went for a walk.

He ran around town looking for the dog.

Tom heard his name being called.
Tom has strong hairy hands.

How's school going?
I don't like to travel.
She wants to wait till the wedding.

Everyone was running around.
It's Toni's book.
Unfortunately, the article you asked for is not in stock.
She's just starting to play the piano.
Who did you hear the rumor from?
The swallow is a harbinger of summer.
She looked very beautiful in her new dress.

Tom knew for sure that what he did was against the law.
Can I pay by Mastercard?
The public opinion strongly supported the project.
Passengers slept in their cabins when the ship collided with a huge iceberg.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tom is in the garden too.
The engine is broken somehow.
What do you think I just did?
You're not feeling well today.
Had John come, I shouldn't have come.
Though it was very late, he continued to work.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
Please speak clearly so that everyone understands you.

She's been very busy since last week.
Tom was very polite.
I didn't get out of my garage because a car was passing.

Tom has much to learn.
The flowers will soon bloom.

I like to travel with my husband, no one else.
I'm sorry, you're paying for the overweight.
She introduced herself to the people present.
Tom tried to keep calm.

He's twice her age.
She called him.
I can't reach him.
How often do you watch TV?

I stepped on something funny.
She died.
And most importantly, don't lie.
It's up to you to learn or not.
She hates singing sad songs.

Excuse me.
How long will you be in Japan?
I'm not used to speaking in front of others.
He's still in bed.
Give her that!
The food tasted like garlic.
The shop sells newspapers and magazines.
He walks to school.
A skilled falcon hides his claws.
Tom loved Mary, but she didn't love him at all.

I'm sorry, I just had to laugh like crazy!
Misako married a Canadian last June.
I'm full of shit.
The committee has ten members.
Tom and Mary talked all night.

I went for a walk in the park.
I wrote a letter yesterday.
Tommy couldn't answer the last question.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
How long can I borrow this book?
Just then the phone rang.
Tom told Mary to go home.
She's the girl who got an Oscar for this movie.
Ken ran up the slope.
Tom and Mary eat lunch together every day.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Excuse me, how much does this cost?
Tom is still crying.
He thought about his mistakes.
False!
He's in danger of losing his job if he doesn't make more effort.
He did exactly what I told him.
I have four times as many CDs as you.

We must water the flowers.
Can you stop talking?
Who do you think I am?
Tom was expelled for violating the school's school policy.

Who was the last one to hit the target?
Tom has registered?
He pretended not to listen.
Always be prepared for an emergency.
He was so busy, he didn't go alone, he sent his son.
Tom appears to be sleeping.
I swear I'll wait for you.
When a woman masturbates, hormones are released that increase femininity.
I found a solution, but I found it so fast, it can't be the right solution.
You're a fool to go to the movies and then sleep.
I couldn't remember the title of the song.
He wanted to come with us.
I didn't feel like going out.
Tom left Mary some food.
He put his bag on the table.
Do we want to be friends?
But you're not there.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Don't say that!
I couldn't handle him.
Tom was once trampled on foot by a woman with high shoes on the train.

Turn left and you'll see a white building.
Mrs. West and his wife are in their honeymoon.
The two children were the same age.
I've been friends with him since I was a kid.
The enemy forces began an attack.
What am I supposed to do?
Her dream had come true.
Let them in.
You can speak German.

We've run out of our cohesion for this week.
If Tom doesn't go, then I won't go either.
Soldiers resisted the enemy's attack.

She killed herself with poison.
84-year-old, I dreamed of a fleeting love.
Tony learns after dinner.
Don't be so red about a kiss!
You must be hungry now.
Tom looked at the tachometer.
He was awarded a million dollars' compensation.
He married a Canadian.
He's more abundant than we were last.
We tried to get along with them.
She's helping him.
He died of acute lymphatic leukemia.
You'd be a good teacher.
We got photographed on the beach.
I'm setting up a horse for the race.
He dressed as a woman.
I want to see a volcano.

I'd like to report a theft.
He often takes me for walks.
What happened between you and Tom?
Limonade tastes too sweet.
She's Japanese.
Have you known Tom for a long time?No, I just met him.
George will come.
Where else do you wanna go?
I'm barely on cash.
I can't sleep.
What happened?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The room smelled like tobacco.
She's super-necessary, too, unmade.
Can I sit?
Tom met Mary on the way to school.
I wonder who to invite.
She doesn't have to go alone.
A wise man learns from his mistakes.
My friend George is coming to Japan this summer.
Only then did I realize my mistake.
I have a dream.
He's a liar.
I'm buying a video.
Tom came home drunk from a party.
He didn't even have enough money to take the train home.
Please come!
Kim is four years older than me.
He said, "That's not true".
Tom often misses school.
He's not ashamed of his bad behavior.
Whose food is this?
You mean it?
History deals with the past.
That's the most important part.
I have to take medicine.
The train arrived at Osaka Station.
I think that's interesting!
I don't know my own age.
Johanna is as lovely as her sister.
Let's relax on the beach today.

I like to hear the bell ringing of a pendulum.
He's a good doctor.
Is there a cat under the table?
Without her help, I wouldn't have made it.
He's not good enough to be a teacher.
I think museums are closed on Mondays.
If you do, I'll throw you out.

Get up early, or you'll be late.
When I was a kid, I used to go to the coast every summer.
Can you play guitar?
Tom never thought he'd fall in love with Mary.
He raised his hand to stop a taxi.
Don't you want to go out to eat?
Japan is not rich in mineral resources.
If God didn't exist, they'd have to invent him.
I ate lunch.
John spoke to his client on the phone.
If you stop learning, you'll fail.
Who seeks, finds.
Tom cried.
The desk Ken uses is old.
What a wonderful sunset! Let's stay here for a while to watch it!
I'm for a reform of the German spelling.
The sun shines during the day, the moon at night.

He should never see his parents again.
What are you worried about?
Kim is two years older than him.
Everything I say is true.

If I had enough money, I would have bought the book.
How about we go to the movies?
She has 2,000 books.
The tenno is the symbol of the unity of the people.
She gave me the wrong address on purpose.
You ought to be more careful what you say.
I met Ken yesterday.
If only we had a garden!
She has a tendency to speak ill of others.
The road was blocked by a snowstorm.

Tom woke Mary up at 6:30, according to her wish.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Have you heard this news?
Be polite while I'm gone!
The teacher said I should learn more.
You think money really matters to me?
I look forward to finally seeing everyone again.
Fuji is covered in snow in winter.
Be quiet while he's playing the piano.
I don't like his way of speaking.
I'm a student.
Maria likes to watch TV.
I encouraged the students to learn more.
What would you like for breakfast?
He lives near the school.
He's used to working hard.
I thought of something good.
Car swallows properly.

She worked for her family.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
I hate this weather!

Tom is the one I never want to talk to again.
He seemed to have been ill.
I still don't think the internet is a place for kids.
He almost lost an eye.
I admire him for his courage.
His room is always like a chicken coop.
Did you see the eclipse yesterday?
I ate lunch with Tom.
I didn't get out of my garage because a car was passing.
I like learning languages.
Tom often fails to keep his promises.
One day I met him.
Nice flight!
Tom was bitten by his horse.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Do you know how many people starve every year in the world?
You've been walking a lot today.
It was really funny that everyone believed my story.
Tom is probably waiting.
I'm gonna do everything I can to help.
Maria balanced it in her hand.
He couldn't have been there yesterday.

I infected him with my cold.
She painted the picture on the wall.
Maria began to undress.
Get mine first!
Maria made a statement in court against Tom.
He hadn't learned English before he went to America.
Why do you ask?
I don't have a younger sister.
Unfortunately, my cat ran away somewhere.
Papa fixed a broken chair.
I really need your help.
, it can't be half past three!
I met her by accident.
You know where he went?
Hey, you, what are you looking at my girlfriend for?
I'm not getting rid of this stubborn cold.
Experiments are conducted in a laboratory.
I like your car.
The defeat hurt her pride.
I haven't heard from him since.
I have some good news for you.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Maybe he's not happy.

Strong hair is a symbol of masculinity for me, so I like it very much.
How was it back in school after so long?
One night he had a dream.
The moment she saw her mother, she started screaming loudly.
The main character dies at the end of the book.
We should go to the party together.
I'm good at math.
He's thinking of selling his house.
I won't let anyone down.
What about tomorrow night at 9:00?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Should I heat this?Thank you! It's good.
Please shut up and listen.
The birth assistant is in crisis as the number of birth assistants is declining.
Stay standing! If you take one step, I'll kill you!
The two brothers went on a journey together.
She took the lid off the box.
You can get along with him.
I'm afraid it's going to rain this afternoon.
You're putting too much emphasis on this event.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Something's been wrong with my internet connection lately.
Thanks! I can't remember how to say it in German.
It's over between us, give me my ring back!
What do you need?
I want him to read this.
Tom forgot to sign.
What are you thinking?
Is Tom really a boy? -How do you mean that? -He's so cute and his behavior is so girlish.
No matter how much she eats, she never grows.
I'm not as big as my brother, but I'm bigger than my dad.
I can't protect you.
to tell the truth, we got married last year.
What are we gonna do for lunch?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The clothes of the tourists do not meet the local standards of morality.
Bus a man sat next to me.
He ran faster than his brother.
I like reading stories more than writing them.
Tom has been bitten by his horse.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's not afraid of snakes at all.
He ran as fast as he could.
Tom should have discussed this with his parents.
Something so beautiful certainly doesn't lose its value.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I never expected to meet her in a place like this.
She sent me an answer to my letter right away.
The land gave its yield.
Tom has returned home from Boston.
Which cheese do you like best for wine?

My brother can play guitar very well.
I heard my name called twice in the dark.
The professor gave a lecture on French history.

She told him something.
You see?
The children rolled a big snowball.
I wonder if I should answer his letter.
Get in through the narrow gate.
I fell asleep around 12:00 at night.

Tom never thought he could accomplish what he just did.
I never liked biology.

The river flows into the sea.

He answered my question with no.
Doctors wore a white mask over their nose and mouth.
You didn't join the club, did you?
Tom worked here for how long?
He likes to read books.
Tom is always in need of money.
She's dressed in white.
When do you leave the house in the morning?
In my opinion, German is the best language in the world.
We can't pull this car.
I agree with your view on the tax.

I bought a wristwatch, and the next day I lost it.
️School starts at 8:00 in the morning.
I'm busy tomorrow.
Together they built a snowman.
The concert was a success.
Ah! is a cry.
Tom unbutted his shirt.
The meeting took place here.

Then we shake hands and say, Goodbye!
The sky is full of stars.
This is a book about stars.

You're taking a break right now.
I saw your friends here yesterday.
I don't consider this discovery particularly important.
Have you ever been cheated on?
I heard dogs weeping last night.

I learned a lot from Tom.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The dog kept his owner from harm.
What a waste of energy!
If something goes wrong, I'll take responsibility for the consequences.
Tom knew that people would make fun of him because of his size, but he still decided to try out for a spot on the basketball team.
I haven't eaten lunch yet.

Tom has clearly refused.
I glanced at the magazine.
I'll show you the city.
What do you mean, "I'm not a doctor"?
I'd rather ride a bike than walk.
She's not fit for the job.
Who found my lost book?
Never lie to me again!
Can I take a day off?

They stopped talking.
Put salt in the boiling water.
Even the richest man in the world can't buy her love.
Ask Tom again!

I waited till midnight for my husband.
She can barely speak.
Mama made me a cute-looking skirt.
Tom abstains from salting because of high blood pressure.
She's five years younger than him.

Don't ask.
I don't know exactly where I was born.
Kaliningrad was formerly called Königsberg.
She's been asleep all this time.
No need!
You can't trust him.
I saw the girl swimming in the river.
Can you understand what I'm saying?
Baseball stadium was full of excited spectators.

Do you have any pets?
She's been watching TV for three hours.
The dragon flew fast like a bird in the air.

You're in my way.
As if nothing had happened, he continued reading in his book.
He's the least likely to come.
I lost my trust in the doctor.
He was elected president.
Have you invited Tom to dinner without telling me?
Tom has dropped an empty test sheet.
Please stay seated for a moment.
Strictly speaking, his answer is not correct.
She's a nurse.
Don't even try to pump me for money.
Maria is trying on clothes.
I usually get up at 8:00.
Fix my toy.
Tom has admitted his mistake.
He works in the bank.
She smiled shy at me.
Before I die, I wanna sleep with a porn actor once.
Please keep telling me!
The moon has risen.
I can't help because I'm busy.

How many eggs did you get yesterday?
Make the TV louder.
Tatoeba                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I know you're rich.
She smiled at him.
You know Mr. Takahashi?
Why are you always late?

I guess I didn't help.
I won't leave if it doesn't stop raining.
Tom almost drowned.
He's playing golf on the weekend.
What was the reason you started playing the violin?
Please tell me your current address.
When she saw the result, she was delighted.
Yesterday it rained.
She must have passed 40.
I got my son to fix the door.
Take a bus.
I built this doghouse myself.
Excuse me, but this is my place.

The sun had almost set.
I need your clothes and your bike.
Frankly, his speeches are always boring.
I wanna know how he manages to make the most of his time.

We ran in the park.
Tom can't stand still.

John flew to America on the plane.
He's someone who's done it by his own power.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

He has a sense of humor.
She was in pain and screaming.
She's not my type.
How do you say I love you! in French?
I'd rather stay home than go out.
I gave him one to thank him for his help.
What's your favorite food?
This is my dictionary.
I called him.
Frost has damaged the flower.
He's not a politician, he's a lawyer.
I wonder why I didn't feel like we were strangers when we first met.
I don't know how to use this CD player.
Tom always has a camera with him wherever he goes.
I've been up all night lately, so I'm a little sleepy.
Who do you think will win?
I didn't turn off the light.
He thinks the story is true.

"Oh yeah!"
Have you got plans for Saturday?
I have to help him.
I was led into the reception room.

How much is this stuffing?
Everything is quiet.
Password is "Muiriel".
She kissed him.
When she grows up, she wants to be a tennis player.
Stop it, just because my English is terrible, treating me like a child!
He'll go swimming, whether you go with him or stay home.
There must be a solution.

You should supplement your diet with vitamins.
When do you go to Boston?
He has a foreign car.
Why didn't you come to the party yesterday?
You mean I killed Tom?
We're connecting Einstein to the theory of relativity.
No matter how much money you have, you can't buy happiness.
I went online late last night.
Tom wiseth his fingerprints from the knife.
Johannes stood alone in the room with his arms tied together.
It was time for a change.
My son can count to a hundred now.

If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
He's supposed to know the secret.
If the earth stopped spinning, what would happen in your opinion?
She stared at him surprised.

The big ugly tree destroys the beauty of the house.
I had him fix my wristwatch.

If the lamp is hot, please wait for about 45 minutes until the lamp is cooled to avoid burning.
I've decided not to watch the movie.
A squirrel flies very fast.

The basis of the argument is the assumption that the rules in question exist in the language.
He gets along with Mr. Braun.

How long have you been in Japan?
Bill accepted my statement as true.
Tom is the strongest.
Be kind to the people around you.
Maria drew a house and a tree.

I give you my word.
He put the book in his pocket.
Tom ought to be able to win.
I'm a linguistic nerd.
They hunted deer and foxes.
He returned to Japan.

What, there's no such thing!
Stop talking about the game!
So what's your suggestion?
I just finished my homework.
Tom has broken his promise.
Where's my seat?
I'm sorry, you dropped your hat.
Which shirt do you prefer, the red or the blue?
I'm gonna get over my low salary somehow.
They secured permanent employment for the workers.

Tom was eating his dessert when the phone rang.
The front door of the house was open.

He's not as stupid as you think.
Mike, did you hear the conversation?
People are afraid of war.
I can't sing as good as Marie.
What's your favorite food?
Never seen Tom cry.
Teaching requires a lot of perseverance.
From a distance, the rock looks like a human face.

The train was leaving the station.
Tom's father is supposed to be a hobby photographer.
He married his daughter to a rich man.

We are human.

Let's wait here until she comes back.
Tom sat smoking on the bench.
I've been to Canada.
Tom ran away from home.
The day is almost over.
I'm at the airport now.
What happened to Tom?

You're expecting too much from her.
How's your cold?
Tom was about to get thirsty.
She's very hot.
Everybody knew the song.

The land gave its yield.
She's a great student.
Show me another watch.
Bus can take up to forty people.
I talked to her for an hour.

I was going to the beach today, but then it started raining.
I grew up in this area.
The car crashed into a tree.
Write your name and address on this envelope.

Today was the worst day in Sarajevo.
What do you want as a Christmas present?
I like eggplants.

This is a difficult situation.
Now I can say, I couldn't stand your blood, Tom.
If Tom writes that way, then it can't be wrong.
Sop is useful for removing dirt.
We asked him to come back.
I have a thousand cattle.
Tom says he still has stomach pain.
We went to our old school.
Don't stay there.
Who is this man?
It was largely his own fault.

Tom, are you sleeping?
I have a headache.
She started looking for a job.
Suddenly the lion fell on the dumper.
Come on, I'm ready for that.

The train was full of passengers.
I'm at least a little older than you.

I cannot express how grateful I am for your help!
He had ambitions of becoming politically famous.

He arrived two days early.
You'd better back up now.

I found the spot where Tom's plane crashed.
The plan is being discussed.
I go to church every day.
What was the name of the hotel again?
Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine in 1952.
She sews very well.
He gets mad real quick.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom wanted to spend New Year's Eve with Mary.

Come on, I'm not changing my mind.
She said goodbye.
I'm also a tourist.
The shop closes at 7:00.
I don't even trust myself, and because I can't trust myself, I can't trust anyone else.
Tom sneaked out of the room.
Are you allergic to this medicine?
Let's get this started.

I'm from Australia.
Can't you translate something more faithful from Japanese?
Do you want some more coffee?
He has his own car.
How long have you been here?

I spent $500 in one day.
I owe it to my mother that I was able to overcome my difficulties.
It's entirely up to you.
She supports the family.
Tom doesn't know what's really going on.

The train leaves in five minutes.
I'm nervous about his affection.
The rainy season has begun.
He gave all his wealth to his son.
Bert's not going to high school, is he?
The last letter is mine.

Meet me on Sunday!
Although she was not injured when her car nearly collided, she got a goose bump.
The fabric for my dress costs 10 euros a meter.
The policeman blew the trigger pipe and gave the car a signal to stop.
If you see a suspicious person, please report this to the police.
Then I'll ask him about it tomorrow.
Kate won't be celebrating her birthday.
I wonder who to invite.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I got my watch stolen yesterday.
The longer I think, the less I understand.
He said he wouldn't come in, but he finally came in.
I'm going to get out.
When Tom woke up, Mary was just taking a shower.

I booked a drink for two hours at discretion for 2,500 yen in a Japanese bar near Shinjuku Station.

Do you speak Italian?
I decided to live in Australia after graduating.
I don't like coffee.
He looks very much like his father.
I planned on going home without going any way, but my feet somehow carried me to the bookstore.
Don't you want to bring an umbrella for safety?
He took his own life at the age of thirty.
She opened the door with a beating heart.
I wanna go to bed early today.
I have to find it.
I look forward to your letter!
I went there early to secure a good seat.
I don't know how to make friends anymore.
He seems ill.
You're absolutely right.
She wears a hat.
The old lady was so kind to show me the way to the station.
I'm a little busy.

Tom lost his wife seven years ago.
He came exactly as we expected.
Wake up!
He should be cleared up and take responsibility.
That's it!
️We must learn to live together as brothers or we will perish together as fools.

She speaks both English and German.
Stop it!
Tom likes to talk about music.
The Romans persecuted Christians.
I got a rash on my hands with dishwashers.
The first half they were on the offensive.
As for this crime, it's getting old.
He apologized to me for his rudeness.
He's young, but he's smart.
Tom returned to Boston last night.

You asked the driver for damages.
I'm a teacher.
Do you come here often?
I tried to solve the problem.
He may have missed his train.
She bowed and picked up a pebble.

The pasture is 10 acres.
Of us five, she no doubt speaks most languages.

Tom disappeared in 2003.
Had I had more money, I would have bought the pen.

Can I hold your hand?
It was just a bad dream.
Someone's knocking out a Futon.
I'm not a specialist.
Statistics deals with figures that represent reality.
You're out of your headache?
The sun shines during the day.
How tall are you?
What would you do in my place?

You don't have a fever.
His theory was totally unrealistic.

How did you get the blue stain on your leg?
The atomic bomb totally destroyed Hiroshima.
I don't see why I should apologize.
I am not allergic to penicillin.

Buses leave here at what time of the day?
Tom went?
Eat a banana!
Tom laughed.
The child had a fever.
I am grateful for what she did.
I want work.
The little girl politely bowed to me.

She had shiny black eyes.
I didn't even ask for it.
You're proud of your smart son.
Whatever you say, Japanese English is Japanese.
Are you interested in the girl?

Allah 
What do you think I should wear to my date tomorrow?
She gave her whole life to study physics.
He has a keen ear.
Tom has never eaten raw horse meat.
She teaches English.
He knows a lot about animals.
I don't have a pencil.
Bus
Get moving!
There are no dogs bigger than this.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I advised him to quit smoking.
You make me happy.
You've lost a lot.
I don't want to work.
Yoko is too weak to work.
Bring Tom here.

I am Tom's father.
He was more or less drunk.
Tom reads a book of 220 pages in seven hours. Mary reads a book of 280 pages in nine hours. Which of the two reads faster?
He was so angry that he forgot to eat dinner.
Although she was so sick and she had such a headache, she only had to sleep one night and she was already recovering.
Mama goes to the market every day to shop.
She helped her younger brother with his homework.
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
You're being so rude.
I was worried too.
The teacher tried to get the students to get used to the school.
Can you do me a favor?
While he's resting, he's listening to music.

Tom whispered something into Mary's ear.
It's too late to go out now.
He's more of a teacher than a writer.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

That was really hard work.
I'm looking around for a bag for my wife.
The river is wide.

He was the worst in his class.
Tom finally discovered the place where the treasure was hidden.
Is your wife a good cook?

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Nobody else was hungry.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I haven't paid my ticket yet.
He died suddenly.
When did you get back?
You think Tom was hungry?
He lives a comfortable life.
Japan is the only nation that has been hit by atomic bombs.
Bob has many books in his room.
He had an accident.
Have you ever studied abroad?
Tom went to the doctor.
He made a second key from this key.

I don't even know why I like Tom so much!
They worship her with all their heart.
According to the dentist, caries does not necessarily come from sweetness.
This is the best camera in the store.
I sat outside and learned Japanese.
She's been learning French for a few years.
The police officer told me that the last bus leaves at ten.
Which animal would you compare me to?
We're not going anywhere today.
I like jazz.
Papa's always busy.
Who's your teacher?
I've ripped the photo where I'm on it into small pieces.
I don't have any other boyfriend than you.

When is the break?
Do you prefer spring or autumn?
I said, get out!
He held his tongue and said nothing.
️Read this!
He left the business to his son.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He crossed the street.
Did you feed the dog?

I'd rather die than marry you!

The pill I just took seems to be working.

He taught me how to write.
Please stop smoking.
I'll be in England in a week.
I've been friends with Tom for many years.
It's finally starting to rain.
How many Santa Claus are there?
Do you think Tom did that?
You executed the captain's order exactly.
I look out, and it's starting to rain.
I can't stand it.
I just didn't get the wording right.
I remember my school days very well.
Please come over if you like.
Tom insisted.
He stayed silent.
I'm always proud of my family.
My brother is two years older than me.
Thank you very much for your letter.
Give me some water, please!
He dedicated his entire life to helping poor people.
I'll be back soon.
We think the reason for his success is his hard work.
I live in Japan.
Tom has dedicated his life to the anti-nuclear energy movement.
Papa asked me if I was getting along with the Jones family.
That's my favorite song.
Primitive computers existed long before computers were developed.
He saw the police car and ran.
I slept all day yesterday.
We must leave now.
She didn't say a word of encouragement.

Everyone thinks the same thing.
You mean it?

I haven't seen him since last Sunday.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

That's why I was late for class.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.

He still loves her.
Can you close the door?
He promised me he'd be here at 4:00.
Let's go in the morning.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom has blue eyes.
He lives somewhere near this park.
Where have you been this week?
The little girl clinged to Tom.
Let's try it!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Thunder! That's not bad!
Excuse me, I'd like to try this.
If you give him the little finger, he'll take the whole hand.
Tom was shot in the back.

This is a dream!
I'm totally exhausted.
We exchanged greetings.
You're gonna have to let all this noise go right or wrong.
I consider it unlikely that such a situation will happen again.
Curry dish is too spicy.

You have no right to judge these people.
You should go.
Tom finds volleyball more interesting than basketball.
This is a very good tea.
Tom was just about to leave when Mary knocked on the door.
She bit him.
I don't want to live alone.
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom has read a book on the Spanish flu of 1918.
I handed over the operation to my son.

The food is here.
When I was in elementary school, I dreamed of being a pilot.
You're not a student.
I'm a night person.
Leave me alone!
Tom said who fixed his car?
I'm done with work for today.
Do you like black cats?
I got on the wrong bus out of a shudder.
Have you ever been to Disneyland?
When I went to see him, he was asleep, but I woke him up.

He performed his duties with care.
How about the daytime?
I can't live without TV.
She never dreamed of meeting him overseas.
I did it because I wanted to please him.

Which is your book, this one or that one?

She was wearing a simple blue dress.
Give me a piece of chalk, please.
There's nothing nicer than a hot bath.

I have a red bike.
Philip said, "Come and see".

A crossroads is a place where two roads intersect.
I can't find Tom. He may have left already.

She has no one to talk to.
She's getting out of my way.
She speaks French fluently.

He's old, now it's up to you to take care of him.
I'm not bothered.
Life is like a chess game.
You're incredibly naive.
You can't carry the piano alone.
He fights with his back to the wall.
We found out he just made up the story.
Look at the picture.
Thank you so much for coming.
Do you have an English dictionary?
He doesn't listen to my advice.
Keep below -18 °C.
Have you ever been in a long distance relationship?

I know the author's name.
I'm in a hurry today.

Take an example of Tom.
Here are pictures.
Tom wants to know why Mary isn't here.
I like sushi.
I have nightmares often.
Please give me a cup of tea.
Do you want to shake hands?
They wandered the desert looking for a buried treasure.
I don't want to do this.
He caught a cold from his sister.
He must have other talents.
Tom?What are you doing here?I could ask you that, too, Maria.
She decorated the room with beautiful furniture.
Tom got a prize for the highest sales performance within the company.
I'm going to meet the parents.
He's a very dangerous person.
Cats can see even in the dark.
If I remember correctly, they're cousins.
Tom is smart.
Let's first measure your temperature.
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
We took a taxi so we wouldn't be late.
Don't complain.
He remained calm during the crisis.
They greeted me with a smile.
Did you sleep well last night?
She took a deep breath.
How many books do you have?
I watched TV for two hours last night.
We lost her sight over half an hour ago.
Be my guest.

While chasing the kid who was playing a joke, she lost a shoe.

The two lines cross at right angles.
Mark/Space has released an update of Missing Sync for Windows Mobile for Mac OS X on July 18.
Tom can't stand Mary's behavior anymore.
He was lying on his back.

Dan got a winking cat from his colleagues for his birthday.
She does look tired.
She's not a permanent employee of this company.
️A skilled athlete should be bold.
I thought you were dating Tom.
My mother used to say she was proud of me.
She usually does her homework before dinner.

She's studying English.
My son wants to be a Lincoln.
He came home late last night.
Tom doesn't like this color.
She likes to paint.
He was obviously nervous.
How is life in Paris?Ah, since I'm not used to speaking French yet, I kind of feel like a toddler.

I ate.
Well, the night is very long, isn't it?
Baseball rolled right in front of me.
Wherever you go, I'll follow you.
Can I touch this?
He looked like he saw a ghost.
Tom watched TV all day.
The power's out.
Long ago, when Pluto was still a planet, there was a boy named Tom.
The two boys began to accuse each other.
The baby was raised by his grandmother.
Please clear the plates there.
I'd like to apologize for the other day.
It looks like we've got everything.
Academic year starts in Japan in April.
You're more into the humanities. I don't think you're good at the exact sciences.

Bus stops in front of my house.
He was killed by my hand.
I can't convince Tom.
Tom trembled from the cold.
Tom doesn't go anywhere alone.
I just couldn't say no.
You must abide by the law.
Do you want me to drive you home?

Take care of your business.
He's a really brave man.
Please replace it with another.
They eat apples.
He is the father of three children.
So far, so good.
I don't know who to trust anymore.

I'm used to the heat of summer too.
They looked very happy.

I'm not afraid of anything.
I couldn't come because of the rain.

He's back from China.
The boy pulled the bark of the tree.
I went to the park yesterday.
He's unconscious.
I trust you with Mr. Tanaka.
Cooking is interesting.
I'll pay the bill.
There's nothing exciting to do?

I think she's over 40.
He's used to talking in front of people.
Tom didn't come because he's in bad physical condition.
Time is the time I'm fishing.
We go fishing occasionally.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom thinks cars have faces.
I don't want to turn brown.
You don't have to go if you don't want to.
How could I be a robot? Robots don't dream.
The wounded soldier could barely walk.
Tom is not to blame.
Can I borrow your fork?

Put the tomato salad in the fridge.
I'll meet him tomorrow.
It's cold.
Tom lies unrestrainedly.
He sat at his desk, his eyes closed.
The conditions of use shall enter into force on 20.10.2003.
I'll try it on.
The bank lent him $500.
Have you ever donated blood?
I'll have time next Sunday.
He fought against racial discrimination.
He changed school last year.
I'll be home by 10:00.
He was standing on the side of the road.
Everyone's busy except for me.
I only slept two hours.
I want to go to a country without a set.
Can you show me on the map?
He looks suspicious.

She declined the invitation.
I envy him for his happiness.
I have a question.
I'd like to have ram.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Golf is a rather expensive sport.
She just turned 12.
She's seventeen.
On the one hand, I want to forget Tom as soon as possible, but on the other hand, I don't want to forget him.
Tom went in to the window.

He's blond.
Let's play volleyball!
Maria spent almost ten years imprisoned unjustly.
I have stomach pain.
I'm done with this book.
I treated him like my own son.
She's six years older than me.
The tie fits your shirt well.
I thought I could do it over the phone.
Sunday, the shops were not open.
I slept until 10:00.
I'm more concerned with my family than my job.
What kind of work are you looking for?
The hospital is nearby.
And then the Romans came in 55 BC.
Will he come? No, I don't think so.
I'll be back at 7:30.
Don't mess around here. Get back to work!
We want to climb that mountain.
Origami has two left hands.
Don't ask me what I want.

Why are you in such a hurry?
Petroleum is very useful for our lives.
Tom's house was burning.
Tom is probably dead.
I'll meet him tomorrow.
Without your help, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish this job on time.
John was always there for me when I was in trouble.
The man who dances on stage is my uncle.
My big brother can drive.
You really don't want coffee?
The effect of medicine was over.
Have you read the recommended books?
Until recently, I didn't know anything about it.
He's tired of reading.
Where did you see her?
Tom, be careful!
The vengeance of heaven is slow but sure.
Tom sings well, but Mary doesn't.
I should have studied law too.
My father runs a run every morning.
Tom and Mary both arrived late for class?
I want to meet him under any circumstances.
I miss you.
Christoph Columbus once fought Kerberos, the three-headed guardian of the underworld, with nothing but his hat.
She was in hospital for six weeks because of her illness.
Tom promised never to be late again.

How far is it to the station?
Tom was thrown from his horse.
The streets were adorned with flags.
He's the doctor I spoke of yesterday.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.

I haven't seen him much lately.
He died of excess effort.

I couldn't live without music.
I don't have any energy today.
Fearing to miss the train, she ran to the station.
What's the name of this song?
I hate him.

What makes the difference between the simplicity that makes it so beautiful and the hopelessly boring?
Do you want another glass of fruit punch?
This is the latest fashion.
I love science fiction!

Tsubasa is a very fast train.
The girl likes music.
Tom has postponed his departure to Sunday.
He finally achieved his goal.
When he leaves the house, there will be peace in it.
Do you have a cell phone, Tom?
Tom helped Mary get up.
What would you do if I was unfaithful?
Can't you wait ten minutes?
I'm ready for the extreme.
It was very cold this morning.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
The sick old man was in fact none other than the Buddha.
Tom has cancer.
I discovered a superpage today: the Tatoeba project.Tatoeba I've known and worked with for ten years.
I'd rather be curled up somewhere.
Tom is not there because he is on a business trip.
He took a day off.
Tom bought me a dragon.
He has a keen sense of observation.
I've read this before.
What a smart student you are!

I went through the document again.
She thoroughly taught the students the basics of English grammar.
He helped me carry the chair.
The hunter shot a bear.

She told him to learn.
He practiced at home every day.
Tom has a sore throat.

How long do you think they've been married?
How fast she swims!
I want to be a nurse.
The bird spread its wings.
You like snow, don't you?
Drivers must watch the children crossing the street.
She's fainting.
Jim's mother bound his cut.
It's too late to turn around now.
Ten people were carried into the little room.
Life is nothing but a fleeting dream.
She left her son to his fate.
What are you looking for?
What you say is more important than how you say it.

He couldn't work because of illness.
When she entered the kitchen, nobody was there.
The recession has led to an increase in unemployment to 5%.
She got engaged to him.

This is a job you chose, right?
How much do you want?
I've invited them over and over, but they never came.

I'm not so stupid as to deny this overwhelming beauty.
He seemed tired when I spoke to him on the phone.
We're right behind you.
I saw a spider crawling over the ceiling.
When we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of our cat.
I was gonna give this to a friend.

It would be better if you didn't drive.
My sister looks like my grandmother.
I just finished my work.
She went to the movies the other day.
Tom and Mary are thinking about divorce.
The children washed their feet.

Flowers are the smile of the earth.
Tom is certainly not against it.
He watched the children swimming.
He smells of the soup.

The old man looked wise.
Why are you running around in this cold, like we're in the middle of summer?
Who wants hot chocolate?
Everyone wants to meet you.
Tom gave Mary a kiss and then drove to work.
I don't like the color of these walls at all.
I paid $200 in taxes.
They're about the same age.
Clean my kidneys and my heart.
She's unconscious.
Tom leaned back on his chair.
As long as we live, we must work.
Tom and Mary have a strong individuality.
He's the one most unlikely to come.
Let's take a ten minute break.

I reported the theft of my car to the police.
I'm getting excited when I see your face!
She has a beautiful handwriting.
He came back.
There's nothing nicer than traveling.

Tom tried to persuade Mary to go to church with him.
He was lying on the lawn.
Maria has checked her makeup in the mirror.
Have you been able to find Tom?
Papa jogs every morning.
Tom is very tall.
️Tambassade️ has its limits.
That's why I don't like cats.
️️️️️️️️️️️️
12 August is the International Youth Day.
It's very difficult to get along with him.

He has no political ambitions.
When did he say he was coming?
Mama has old-fashioned ideas.

Is that true?
Tom se smears butter on the bread.
Have we never met before?
He's a doctor by profession.
Have you ever milked a cow?
Although I went through all the rain to meet her, she wasn't there.
You should leave, whether male or female.
I can't draw birds.

I usually get home around 7:00.
Give me some water, please.

Welcome back, Tom! We missed you!
x is a real number, so write x∈R.
️We borrowed the money at a high interest rate.
He has good prospects of being elected.
I have sad news.
He took her by the hand.
She gave me the wrong address on purpose.
I'm out of my mind, but I'm quitting.
Don't you know where my watch is?
Since I had been in such a situation before, I knew exactly what I had to do.
We'll build your house according to your wishes.

You've made me lose my appetite!
The police wanted to avoid bloodshed.
You can't behave at the party.
The sun suddenly appears on the mountain path when the scent of the plums appears.
When you were two, you could count to ten.
Let's play ninja.
I want her to be good at cooking.
Do you know who stole Tom's PC?
He lives in a dream world.
She wants to marry a rich man.
The plane went terribly deep.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I couldn't live without a TV.
Fire Station is next to the police station.
Grandfather speaks very slowly.
I beg your pardon for my delay!
She's neither rich nor famous.
He doesn't speak English.
Get on the horse.
I already packed my bags.
Can you see far?
He was stolen in a rush.

I'm on the floor.

She adjusted her schedule to his.
I thought Tom was sleeping.
He didn't see anyone else at the station.
Tom didn't have enough money to buy what he needed.
She lived a lonely life.
I'm the most important job.
A year has 12 months.
We had three planes.
Pugles have sharp eyes.
Was that funny?
The tour guide took us to the hotel.
I started learning Chinese last week.
You going to the movies?
John took a key out of his pocket.
The scissor is gone again!
Let's take the cab!
Don't bother me.
The child is sleeping.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this subject.
Spanish is easy.
I'm from England.
He's a good husband to me.
You must learn English every day.

I tried to solve the problem.
Hotel
Tom cannot concentrate for long.
Where's the exit?
She decided to go.
I have a dog that can run fast.

She's always late.
Did you work last night?
Do you come here often?

Though she has flaws, I like her.
I remember the man's face, but I missed his name.
Tom is dating a student from China.
Behind the hill lies a beautiful valley.
He came first.
Do you know who killed Tom?
I've been looking for you the whole time!
Have you ordered the book?
I was waiting for a taxi.
All boys are the same age.

"Thank you very much!" she said with a smile.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom, you liar!
When I was nine years old, I moved from Germany to England.
Do you usually write kawaii in kanji or hiragana, Tom?Hiragana I like better. They're kind of softer.
April is the fourth month of the year.
I'm worried about him.
It'll be later.
Can you hear me?

What's going on?
Dinosaurs once ruled the earth.
Can all music students play sheet music and improvise?
Get me the paper, please.
She was deeply involved in the scoring of the works.
What do you suggest?
Plant need CO2 to grow
I always walk.
Show me where it is.

Tokyo is bigger than any other Japanese city.

You'd better hurry up. The train leaves at three.
He threw the ball against the wall.

What day is it today?
I'll show you some pictures.
Tom jumped into the lake.
The ship was speeding before a strong wind.
I hate math.
I'm sick of her laziness.
She stumbled on a rock.
Tom has been crying all night.
He got home before 8:00.
How do you imagine your dream school, Tom?
Yes, I'll take my day off tomorrow.
Naked boys swimming in the river.
Tom goes for a walk in the park every morning.
How many Christmas cards did you send?
Japanese giant breasts are considered tiny by the Russians.
Take about three minutes to introduce yourself.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The problem naturally provoked discussions.
Naoko is a swimmer.
I thought you wanted to talk to Tom about it.
We want to be billionaires.
I'm tired of looking at furniture we can't afford.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

You're my enemy.
He was ostracized by a group of young men.
Be kind to the people around you.
You can take a break today.
He can't afford a new car.
Light is much faster than sound.
Tom is disappointed.
After failing four times, he didn't try again.
If you don't help me, I'm not gonna be able to finish it.
Tom and Mary know that John is a very clever one.
Winter is my favorite time of year.
I'm a little more than a little bit screaming.
Eren was so tired, she went to bed early.
I don't want you to do that.
Japan is his second home.
He kissed his daughter on the forehead.
His pessimism depressed the people around him.

When did you return from Germany?
Close the book.
Tom was grounded.
My kids love animals.
Meteorology reports say it's supposed to snow tomorrow.
I should have taken the money.
If I were you, I'd do the same.
I'll always be there for you.
I got stuck in a traffic jam.
I'm learning Chinese and Spanish.
How did you find Tom?He has a very nice voice.Only the voice is nice?He's not so special in appearance, is he?So, I think he's very cute.

I like spending time with you.
She's been dyeing her hair black for years.
Tom's mother was a devout Catholic.
I slept a little during the lunch break because I was so tired.
I made friends with him when I was in Taiwan.
I explained the process to him.
She fell asleep with her caterpillar.

I discovered a book written by my father the other day.
Give me some of your cake. I'll give you some of mine.

French isn't that good yet.
He's taller than any other boy.
He wants to be like me.
He tells delicious jokes.
Tom found the letter that Mary had hidden.
I heard about the accident in the paper.
Have you called her yet?
She put on her sweater.
He has three brothers.
Tom has narrow shoulders.
Excuse me, could you lend me a pencil?

The woman knows where I live.
A primitive people lived there.
Tom didn't believe me.

I'm trying to make it clear.
That's right!
She was wearing a nice dress.
He was wounded in the war.
The bicycle squeezed and stopped.
There are different kinds of politics.
I wrote a love letter last night.
I got my wallet stolen yesterday.

I'm not an artist. I never had the stuff.
He'll be back in a day or two.
Tom pretended not to know the answer.

We wiped out the mice in his house.
We had a quick lunch at the cafe.
Is that beautiful?
Can you play the organ?
Tom lives in downtown Boston.
He only used up as much as he drank.
Write what I tell you!
Don't waste your time and money.
Thank you, that's all.
You are idiots.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He doesn't live here anymore.
I'm a grown man.
What he said is not true.
He failed because of a lack of experience.
I met him on the way home from school.
Ken complained of headaches.
We can't prove that.
Tom said that it was the first time he had eaten such a fine meal.
When will you be back?It all depends on the weather.
I'm ploughing this country for the first time.
️We do not accept a tip.
Tom is in a bad mood.
He's running very fast.
How many Chinese friends do you have?
What did you do in Boston?
Tom can't draw as well as me.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You're absolutely right.
I have to go now.
If you want to be good at school, you have to study hard.
When I think about what I've done, I feel pathetic.

How was your summer?
Tom got into the car.
Jim is not coming today.
We were surprised by the dramatic increase in import volumes.
Why can't I sing like they do?
She heard him cry.
The man on the opposite side is the owner of the store.
This crow flew away.
Are you a member of this society?
You must take the 8:15 train to Paris.

Find the equation of the parable that you get when you move the parable y = x2 − 4x + 7 in x direction by 3, but in y direction by −2 parallel.
The floor broke.
I'm having a little fever.
She ran after me and her hair flew in the wind.

The girls were talking non-stop.
How do you eat that?
This way we waste a lot of time.
My brother went to Fukushima yesterday to help the residents.
I'll call you back later.

Where did you make so much money?
We got lost in the fog.
I realized she was an intelligent student.
This isn't Tom's suitcase.
Silvio Berlusconi is an Italian politician, the current Prime Minister of Italy and a successful businessman.
He can sing well.

Stay the way you are, Tom! You're the way I love you the most.
Don't lose your temper!
I said, get you out.
She can't do anything alone.
Tell me when he gets back.
I usually walk to school.
I felt her hand touch me.
Takeuchi was the only one who didn't accept the invitation.
What did you do last night?
He'll probably stay in Tokyo for a few weeks.

He cheated on the exam by copying his friend's answers.
Mining is one of Chile's main sources of income.
We couldn't convince him.
He rang the door.
He's one of the most famous minds in our country.
Shouldn't we go dancing?

Tom came home completely devastated.
Have you ever written a Wikipedia article?
Get out of bed with you!
Tom was silent.
Can I eat this bread?
I was taking a shower before breakfast.
I learn from time to time.
The paper says he committed suicide.
New York is worth a visit.
️Antiquity carpets are especially valuable.
When can we eat?
I like love stories.

He turned down my offer.
She likes to write poems.
I'd rather be killed than live in shame.
She asked for a raise.
Alex is actually a woman I thought it was a man
Can you read the kanji?
Jane went with her dog Gassi.
The train arrived in Kyoto on time.
Tom has blue eyes.
Get an ambulance.
Tom walked around in underwear.
Don't play in this room.
Where should I sit?Wherever you want.
When you go to the movies, take your sister with you.
Who gave you this?
Tom only counts on a pretty face.
I'll love you till I die.
We spent our summer holidays on the coast.
I have a pain in my back.
Tom couldn't go to the concert because he had to work.
I'm tired!
If you want to lose weight, you have to eat right and exercise a lot.
Are you in a hurry?
Jessie praised Charles for his foresight.
He seems to have been rich.

I think you should eat more, Tom.
Are you planning on eating all this alone?
He can barely speak.
30:00, I have to go!
The situation has changed dramatically.
You saw the game?
Tom, can't you show Maria how to use the scanner?
He noticed I was there.
I have a lot of money in my savings book.
I was in a traffic jam.
Tom refuses to eat his vegetables.
I can't stand him.
I'm going to the same high school as Tom.

Tom's study room points to the garden.
People here have fine taste. A restaurant with bad food, however cheap it may be, can close again!
It's already 11:00.
I'm looking for a job.
She has to study science.

When I hear this song, I think of you and miss you.

He likes watching TV.
I'd like some tea.
He grew up in an artistic family.

I've inherited a considerable fortune.
I am third generation Japanese-born Brazilian.

Have you got a room?
The family seemed damned.
He talks a lot.
The bridge is being repaired.
Get some rest.
You look busy.
I haven't eaten since breakfast and so I'm very hungry.
She got sick, but she recovered soon.
George will surely come.
Now I'm all alone.
Why do you insist on paying your own tuition fees when your parents would love to support you financially?
Don't say anything to Daddy!
Tom has gone bankrupt.

Can you drop me off at the bus stop?
I have a headache.
I plan to go with Tom.
He grew up in Australia.
I can't stand the noise anymore.
The secretary wants a promotion.
He takes care of his family.
Why do you speak English so well?
I've been waiting for you the whole time.
Is it far to town?
I can't help but think of him.
I watched the game from start to finish.
She asked the police for protection.

I don't want to watch TV right now.
Which is your guitar?
I got there before the others.
I want to eat something sweet.
I'm the only one laughing.
The Schrödinger equation describes the time evolution of a quantum mechanical system.

I'm really hungry!
Tom is taking a shower.
I believe in the innocence of my son.
I don't think Tom would mind.
He threw a stone into the lake.
He played his trumpet.
I'm learning Korean.
That's ironic.
You should know.
Can you make jam?
He's not a man who breaks his promises.

Have you got a favorite actor?

Yumi will use this camera tomorrow afternoon.
I shake my head a few times.
The evening was coming.
He broke into a house.
I bought a house with the money I inherited from my grandfather.
She greeted me with a smile.
He tried to get up early.
I'm not allergic to penicillin.
We all know that nobody's perfect.
Go whenever you want.
I don't mind being criticized when I'm wrong.
He learned to swim.
Yesterday it rained lightly.

I had to stay in bed all day.
The old man sat in the chair with his eyes closed.
Who did you vote for in the election?
Can I have alcohol?
I'm adding that I wrote off in my book. I can't step under my readers' eyes anymore.
Tom says he needs a nap.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The wide river flows slowly.

He went to stay with a client.
Oh, what a freak I was!
I make lunch every day.
Were there many people in the park?
It's really amazing that you can buy a 64GB USB stick for only 16 euros today. -Also, in ten years it's probably only going to cost a fraction of that.
I got a letter from her yesterday.

arans are sweeter than lemons.
Never seen Tom so mean.
I couldn't use the faucet because it was broken.

Have you invited Tom to dinner without telling me?

I don't speak French today.
He made them know his plan.
I love you!
A lot of time was wasted.
It stopped raining.
He has little chance of winning.
There's a butterfly!
She bought her daughter a computer.
He's changed.
Muammar al-Qaddafi escaped unhurt.
She traveled all over the world.
Among us, his way of thinking lacks depth.
I have a chicken to rip with you.
Suddenly she burst out laughing.

Without me, you'd be nothing.
Please step aside.
I'm glad to help you.
I've met him before.
There is a silly mental disorder called Paris syndrome.
I bought a red tie.

They've been looking for the missing dog everywhere.
I bought a pencil, but lost this one.
Eye is a window that looks into the heart.
Can you hear me?
I like blue.
My mother is an Ikebana teacher.
Tom was drunk.
Happy New Year!
I loved my life and my money.

That's exactly what I wanted.
She watched him fight his way through.
Please excuse the circumstances I've been setting up.
How old are you?
What are you wearing to your graduation?

Friends invite me to dinner.
He's wrong, to be honest.
He was sitting on the floor.
He lived alone all his life.
Look at this building.
This is gonna be a house.
Tom's parents both died when he was very young.
What a douche! The change was 256 yen smooth!What's smooth about that?Na, that's two high eight!
We live near the big library.
Let me know.
I'd like to paint the fabric.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Don't worry about it!
Tom helped Mary get up.
I can understand why you don't like Tom.
I like to swim, but I don't want to be here.
Goro was so kind to take me to the hospital.

I came to Japan two years ago.
We're sorry we couldn't help you.

Don't you think elementary school students are pretty big these days?
I can't understand his feelings.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

She said she was twenty years old, which was not true.
I told you not to smoke in here.

Don't ask me that.
It's not clear when he got here.
Everyone was invited except me.
I live for the sub-rent.

You look tired, you must have worked your way up.

She commands her husband around like a servant.
I prefer to travel by plane.
She showed her talent.
Jack may speak Spanish.
I'm always surprised by his behavior.
The black is mine.
Tom is a bus driver.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Call me at the office.
I'm glad to hear your voice.
Rainbow has become a symbol of hope.
Maria is tall.
When there's something I need to do, I get the urge to do something else, unnecessary.

I'm good at math.
The discipline at this school is rather lenient.
Have you mixed the margarine with butter?
I bought the car with a 10% discount.
You can do whatever you want with your time.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money in bed.
Fireworks were stopped 30 minutes after the start due to a thunderstorm.
I can't imagine a life without you.
I eat a Nashi pear.

Are you not afraid?
July 11th is World Population Day.
He's still mad.
As far as I know, they always keep their promises.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The phone rang while I was showering.
What a terrible weather.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
She looks happy.
If I knew his address, I'd write him.
The order number of iron is 26.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I put my hand in the pile and felt a soft cloth.
He barely escaped an accident.
Mathematics is her weak spot.
I'd like you to go to the concert with me.
She bought two pounds of butter.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
If it's not you, who am I supposed to show them, the plum blossoms, the color and the scent, how few know?
Neither Tom nor Mary speaks French.
Ah, I forgot to buy tofu.
He's a high school student.
Love  you know what that is?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom caught a shark.
I saw you, that alone makes me happy.
If you don't go skiing, then I won't go skiing.
The older we get, the worse our memory gets.
You wanted to, didn't you?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You can't bribe that judge.
I'm going crazy with her.
Wood is on fire.
Hotel
Which search engine do you usually use?
I don't have time.
Can you please?
You and I have nothing in common.
Tom, are you okay?
Why is life so full of suffering?
Maria has a little pimple.
I cook better than I play tennis.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You must learn much more diligently.
No, I don't know.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The meeting starts at 3:30.

As a high school student, I often stayed for long periods.
We knew it from the beginning.
He wrote the report.
The train station is ten minutes away by car.
So far, so good.
I'm invited to Claudius' party tonight.
Tom is American of German descent.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Can I take this bag on the plane?
I guess you're right, Jane.
I want to live a happy life.
Mignon, a poem by Goethe, is widely read in Japan in the glamorous translation of Mori Ōgai.
The amount of time a person is willing to spend on a particular thing shows how important it is to him.
She's supposed to be a famous actress.
He just left.
I don't feel like going out right now.
As far as I'm sure, the lake is deepest at this point.
I'm a student.
I didn't see anything.
He gets along well with his classmates.
It's incredible that he did something like this.
I don't care much about that.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I gave a speech at the wedding party yesterday.
Maybe you're right.

Take good care of yourself.

I made my own doghouse.
Bus arrived ten minutes late.
I don't like the way Mr. Mueller teaches.
He left the room.
Doctors told him he could see, hear, and taste again.
What is that?
Make a paper on writing English essays.
Kyoto is dependent on the tourism industry.
You respect him.
I went to bed a little later than usual.
I'm busy right now.
Fan asked for his autograph.
Rock impact is a danger to climbers.
Life is beautiful.
Rex was a huge dog.

I didn't mean to hurt you.
How about we go to the movies?
Let's go for a walk.
I can't think of a solution to this problem.
There's something I'd like to show you.
I'm the one.
She's not tall.
You always ruin everything.
He quit smoking.
There's only a small crew aboard the tanker.
He worked too much and ruined his health.
Tom couldn't swim.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You must learn with all your energy.
I avoid air travel if possible.
I think Tom is afraid of snakes.
When she learned that he had suddenly gone off the rails, she was surprised.
He got divorced from his wife last month.
Today is your birthday, Yuri.
Tom, I need to talk to you about something.What?Something serious?Already a little.
I don't want to eat only tomatoes anymore.

Tom sings almost never.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
Crying is an expression of grief.
Have you ever seen a whale?
Tom sat nearby at a table.
He described exactly what happened there.
As far as I could see, I saw nothing but corn fields.
Maria was wearing a black sweater when I met her.
Did you feel an earthquake last night?
Complex numbers make up a body.
My nose has become long
I like that about you, Tom.
I'll pay you back the money today in a week, which means July 21.
I'm also glad we could meet.

I know the city as well as my pocketbook.
Do you know what Tom did yesterday?

Once upon a time, near our village, in a place called Nakayama, there was a small castle, and there was a prince named Nakayama who lived there.
Can you show me on the map?
Tom loved to sing, but nobody wanted to hear him sing.

Tom is too fat.
Passport is something you can't get into another country without.
Tom has a girlfriend whose father is an astronaut.
This is none of your business.

She's poor, but happy.

The gang planned a break-in.
️Don't get involved in my business.
She's still poor.
The doctor examined Tom.
Don't you want to come?Yes, I would!
We need to gather information.
London is a happy place.
Can I call you later?
I read.
I think Tom has a secret admirer.
She kindly showed me the way.
The ruling party now has 50 seats in parliament secured by 5:00.
Tom knows who I am?
I turned down the offer.
If it's nice, let's go for a picnic.
What's going on?The key's gone.What key?The bike key.
Tom explained to Mary in detail how it worked.

She greeted me with a friendly smile.
The older you get, the more quiet you get.
This is an important decision.
Let me fix it.

Do you have any questions?
We sell silk materials.
House of wood burn easier than houses of stone.
Are you Japanese?
She died at the age of 54.
She ran down the hill with him to bet.
Among the industrialized countries, only Japan has an even higher proportion of the population of the elderly than Italy.

He crossed the street.
I got sand in my eyes.
Who's gonna take care of the baby?
I want to know more about you, Tom.
You must keep your room in order.
She practices on the piano every day.
Aluminium is a metal.
He's someone who's done it by his own power.

I have one more question.
Tom worked for a construction company in Boston.
Tom fell down the stairs.
He invested his money in stocks.

Tom held his hands off the radiator.
Show me another watch.
Bill got up early to take the first train.
Clean my kidneys and my heart.
Ever since then, we haven't seen him.
Did you practice piano this morning?
There's nothing worse than war.

The boy put the money in his pocket.

Tom won't have known about it.
Tom saw a man with a hat standing next to Mary and wondered who that might be.
I saw him again.
Who's the goalkeeper?
The brain is in the head.
Fuji is the symbol of Japan.
Had I noticed, I would have told you.
We agreed to his plan.
I asked her to wait a while.

I need a pack of eggs.
A dog can't climb a wall.
It was foolish of Tom to lend Mary money.
I can't imagine a life without you, Yumi.
Tom wants to be an interpreter.
Why did you do this?Because I wanted to.

Have you ever taken a trip abroad?O yes. My first trip abroad was to the American West Coast, to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon, which I always wanted to see.
I would have liked to have bought the book, but I only had 200 yen.
Tom grabbed me by the arm.
You're a real bitch in this game.

Tom is an interpreter.
I'm sorry, I didn't explain it right.
Have you ever eaten anything that Tom cooked?

That's not particularly polite.
Tom learns French every morning.
When I was young, I was thin.
I put something sweet in my mouth, and I felt better.
I dreamt of you tonight.

I know that Tom lied.
Tom said he cared about Mary.
Do you really like him?

This lid is too tight. I can't get it off.
Have you been to Europe?
Tom replied, he's sorry.
Have you ever flown to Europe?
Can you play my guitar?

All right, thanks.
The more you know, the less you understand.
He's usually a rambunctious English teacher, but in reality he's a CIA agent.
I still caught the train.

I wish I'd read this book.
Tom, I'm going shopping.
How's the soup?

We all like you very much.
Pork is usually cheaper than cattle.

Tom wants to be an interpreter.
Maria bought this skirt when?
I love little kittens.
Tom was a pretty good basketball player in school.
I am still a beginner in Esperanto.

Now that he has only five hours left until the exam, Tom finally gets on the road.
What did Tom do in my room?
Papa gave me a new filler.
What's up?
Have you ever been to the diner where Tom works?
upa je još uvijek vruta.
The man sitting there is a familiar.
The man behind the man up there looks like a yakuza.
Who's the goalkeeper?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Who's the goalkeeper?
When Tom asks me specific questions, I never know what to answer.
It's so cold in here.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Do you often argue with Tom?
You really think Tom likes Mary?

Get plates from the kitchen!
Tom had forgotten to thank him.

I can't see apple juice anymore.
The apple tasted very good.
When you whine like that, it's stuck in your throat!
I'm glad to hear that Tom is doing well.
Tom lives next to Mary.
What I just said is just a guess.
Is my sentence correct?
Thank you for everything you've always done for me!
Have you ever been to Europe?
Is that Tom's son?

Tom and Mary put on their furry suits and became Ryō and Rin, a dog and a fox.
I love Turkish languages.
I go for a walk every day.
I like Japanese dishes.

Make a sentence with each of these words!
Tom is a fox named Neon.
I like Japanese dishes.
Maria is not my daughter, but my wife.
I want to stay in Australia for three days.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Let's go to the kitchen.
I can see why you love this place so much.
We need more beer.
I just got back from work.
My mom always loved me.
I love the smell of coffee in the morning.
Tom wants to learn Serbian.
Get the dishes out of the kitchen!
Never heard of this actor.
What language do you want to learn?
I think it's all right, but I'm not sure.
You know how to spell it?
Tom always looks very good. Don't you think so?
I think you should take Tom to the hospital.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom immediately noticed the error.
I'm going to get coffee.
This lid is too tight. I can't get it off.
When I was playing video games in the living room, my mother came and asked if I would go shopping with her.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I agree with Tarō and Ayumi's suggestion.
I know that Tom is a painter.
These oaks are over a hundred years old.
I think it's my fault.
I changed the sentence.
Let me think about it. I'll call you later.
When does Tom come back?
We all like you very much.
The phrase is a bit strange.But I got it from a native speaker!
Tom goes back to work.
Tom is a translator.
I am still a beginner in Esperanto.
Don't bother me now!
I was awake.
I had absolutely no desire to go to work yesterday.

Dear passenger, this is a non-smoking area.
Thanks, Tom.Thanks to you, too, Maria!
I saw Tom crying.
Do you want me to make you a coffee?
It was all difficult.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Are you still playing Pokemon Go?
You're friends with Tom, right?Jo.How is he?
Bus goes to Tokyo.
I've seen something I wish I hadn't.
The child fell asleep.
Tom loves his father very much.
What did you put in there?
Why do you hate Japanese?
Do you want something from me?
Have you ever been in a long distance relationship?
Sometimes I get sad.
I don't like Tom's new hat.
Have you ever visited someone in prison?
I want to stay in Australia for three days.
I'm burning my tongue with chili flakes.
You should not have trusted Tom.
I've been doing a lot of things lately.
The only animal that can laugh is the man.
Tom replied, he's sorry.

I have a beautiful gold filler.

I bought a new filler.
The question surprised me a bit.
The brain is in the head.
I don't like to speak in public.
I don't know why Tom did that.
I have to keep you from it.Why?
Tom waits for Mary in Boston.

I'm eating here for the first time.
Tom spent a few weeks in the hospital last year.
Have you ever been to France?
The dog barks at strangers.

There are as many women as there are stars.
Have you ever visited someone in prison?
We're not foreigners.
Hang up the laundry!
I don't like to diet.
I hope Tom gets better soon.
Winter I don't want to go out.I understand.I'd love to roll on the kotatsu.I don't want to get out of bed.

Tom played hockey.
I know that Tom can swim.
Tom likes our dog.
There's a lot more to life than work.
Tom is a raccoon.
I didn't have anyone to talk to.
He was a hard man.
Speaking of Maria, I haven't seen her in a while.
Do you sell strawberries?

He's going after the problem.
Don't you go to work today, Dad? Are you free?It's a holiday.
Do you really like him?

Maria is slimmer than me.
I want to learn the lesson.
Too many is happier.
I'm afraid to drink that.
I should have kept my mouth shut, right?
Why didn't you have breakfast?
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
Let's put this in the vault!
I dreamt of you tonight, Takashi.
