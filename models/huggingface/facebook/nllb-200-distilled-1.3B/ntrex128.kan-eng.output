Welsh AMs are worried about 'looking stupid'
Some AMs are concerned about the suggestion of changing their titles to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The problem arose from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum have expressed concern that the decision could be ridiculed.
"It rhymes with Twp and Pwp", a Labour AM said, causing concern in their group.
For readers outside Wales: twp means foolishness in Welsh and pwp means stool.
One Plaid AM said the group was "disgruntled" and suggested alternative names.
One Welsh Conservative said his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but said it was just another form of being a Muppeteer or a fool from the MWP.
In this case, Yorkshire pronounces the Welsh letter w as u is pronounced in English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to change names, said: "The details of what members of the Assembly should be called will have to be decided by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017, authorised the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June the Commission published a public consultation on the proposals, which showed strong support for the legislature to be called the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission was in favour of the designation of AMs as Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the name MWP had the most public support.
As AMs suggest alternative options, but making a consensus decision could be a headache for current chair Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft of the legislation on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the Legislative Assembly, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the structure of the committee system.
AMs have the final say on the question of what to call them when discussing legislation.
Macedonians vote to hold a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether or not to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece over its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has also insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents sovereignty over its territory and has consistently objected to its efforts to gain EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President György Ivanov, who opposes the vote for the name change, said he does not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayyev, argue that the name change is the price of EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells are silent as Harlem churches struggle.
Mr. Adams said, "The elderly people I spoke to say that historically there was a bar and a church on every corner".
"Today, there are neither".
He said bars can understand the concept of Maya.
He said that nowadays people interact with each other in different ways.
Today, bars are no longer the comfortable neighborhoods that people regularly visit.
As for the churches, they think that the money leaders who sold property will not last as long as they think, and that they will return to where they started their journey, not today, but tomorrow.
He further said that churches can be removed and apartment buildings with condominiums can be built and people who are not inclined to help their neighbours can live in these buildings.
He said that most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white and they want the day to come when these churches close together soon, because it is a long way from people coming to live in these condominiums becoming members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white religious groups before Harlem became a black capital - that is, before it became a metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martins decades later.
The original white Methodist religious group left in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a religious group of blacks who were worshiping nearby.
A black religious group led by Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martins. Reverend John Howard Johnson led a struggle against retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main street, who refused to hire or pay blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939. But since Father Johnson's parishioners had plans to rebuild the building, Carillon took over the job.
Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called Carillon "the poor man's bell".
In July experts who played the carillon called it by different names: "cultural property" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
It was also the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Diniscio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church 18 years ago to play an even larger carillon, said University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng.
According to the late Meriwether, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The situation at St. Martin's over the past few months has been one of complexity for architects and contractors, some of whom were called by lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The Vestry, the governing body of the parish from lay leaders, expressed its concern in a July letter to the diocese, saying that while the Vestry had no responsibility for hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese, the diocese was instructing the Vestry to pay its own costs.
Some parishioners complained that the role of the diocese was not transparent.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark while diving in California
A 13-year-old boy who jumped into the water to catch a lobster on the opening day of lobster season in California was attacked and injured by a shark, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego, Chad Hamel said he heard a boy screaming for help while diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday morning and went with a group to the boat and pulled the boy out of the water.
'At first Hamel thought it was the enthusiastic cries of a boy holding a lobster, but when he listened carefully, he realized that the boy was screaming in pain, 'I've been bitten!'
I was bitten!'
When Hamel went to the boy and saw him, he said, "The whole neck bone was torn out".
"I shouted out, 'Everybody out of the water!' 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was flown by helicopter to Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical, the hospital said.
It was not known which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
Speaking to the media, Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed that it was not a dangerous species.
Gillis further explained that the victim had traumatic injuries on his upper body.
For investigation and security purposes, the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamis in Escinitas was closed for 48 hours by the authorities.
There are 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not considered to be endangered, Jails said.
SenseBris plans to tap into the UK cosmetics market
It will compete strongly with its department store-style beauty eels with skilled assistants for boots, super drugs and debonams.
The company, which is entering the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market after falling sales of fashion and homewear, will test its large beauty aisles in 11 stores across the country, with the aim of opening more in the coming year if the test is successful.
The investment in cosmetics is being made in a context where supermarkets are competing to use space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and homeware for cosmetics.
For the first time, ScienceBaris plans to offer 3,000 beauty products including brands like Revlon, SC, Tweezerman and Dr. Papa.
The current L'Oreal, Mabeline and Burt's Bees products will also have the same brand status as store-bought products like boots.
The supermarket is also rebranding its boutique makeup range with a view to selling more vegan-friendly products.
In addition, one of the two Sainsbury's stores in Croydon, South London, opened last week and the second one in Selly Oak, Birmingham, to open later this year, the perfume retailer Fragrants Shop will offer discounts.
With the increasing trend of online shopping and buying small items from convenience stores on a daily basis, there is a lot of work to be done to convince people to visit supermarkets.
Mike Coop, chief executive of SenseBury, says that their outlets will often look like department stores and that the supermarket chains will compete with competitors Aldi and Lidl, which are discounting by offering more services and non-food items.
SenseBris has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced many habitats, both of which were purchased two years ago, which has increased grocery sales and thus generated more profit from the purchase of stores.
Previously, the supermarket's efforts to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical divisions had failed.
SenseBaris started a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration between them ended due to an argument over how to share the revenue from the drug stores in its supermarkets.
Sense Barris developed a new strategy after selling its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy stores, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds said it would play a key role in the project by adding more luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Weishee in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at SenseBaris, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty salons to further enhance the store environment for our customers.
We have also invested heavily in specialised training for our colleagues who are always available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to meet the needs of everyone and with the enticing atmosphere and convenient locations, we have emerged as a destination for mind-blowing beauty products that break the old shopping patterns".
'Scarred' Peter Jones for leaving the £11 business of Holly Willoughby
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has been relieved of her £11 million lifestyle brand business deal with Peter Jones of Dragon's Den fame in order to handle her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for his Trolley brand of homeware and accessories.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of this morning's show has announced on Instagram that she is withdrawing from the deal.
Jones is angered that Holly Willoughby pulled out of Peter Jones' lucrative lifestyle brand business deal with Dragons Den fame at the last minute to focus on her new bumper leases with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious after she told a crucial meeting at Jones' business office in Marlow, Birmingham, on Tuesday that she could not give time to Jones' homewear and accessories brand Truly due to her new £1.5 million business deal.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was estimated to increase Willoughby's assets by £11 million pounds.
After announcing on Instagram that she was leaving Truli, 37-year-old Willis Jones, her mother-in-law, left Britain and travelled to her holiday homes far away.
According to one source: "Holly always gave Truley first priority.
It would have supported her fortunes for a long time and kept her popularity alive for a few more decades.
Her decision to withdraw from the contract was a surprise to all concerned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, because the launch was the next day.
The warehouse at Marlowe HQ is packed with ready-to-sell goods".
Experts believe the departure of one of Britain's most popular stars, the host of This Morning, will cost the company millions and further delay its launch, as the company has invested heavily in clothing and homeware products ranging from cushions and candles.
And this can end a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have known Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
He co-founded Truely in 2016 with Willoughby & Cap, and Jones, 52, became chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Aunt Mac Partlin as host of the upcoming show I'm a Celebrity M on ITV.
"We don't like to comment on his business activities", a person close to Jones said last night.
'Then we started to fall in love'
He joked that the news media would criticize him for making a comment some consider unsuitable for the presidency and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said sarcastically in his "newscaster" voice
"I have left nothing behind".
He said he was interested in meeting Kim for a second time after his first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a big step towards making North Korea a nuclear-free nation.
But the talks to denuclearize have stalled.
Three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yang Ho told world leaders attending the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the US had not "responded appropriately" when North Korea had previously decided to take arms embargo measures.
Instead, he said, the US aims to increase pressure by imposing sanctions.
Trump expressed a more optimistic view in his State of the Union address.
"Our relations with North Korea are very good", he said.
"We were thinking of going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were dying.
Our relations are in excellent condition now".
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results, including an end to rocket tests, facilitating the release of hostages and bringing the remains of American soldiers back to their homeland.
And he supported his unusual behavior when talking about his relationship with Kim.
Trump said, "It's very easy to be president, but instead of helping 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded space, we want to allow about 200 people to stand there".
Indonesia A tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds.
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, they were told that foreign NGOs were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was evacuated, no national disaster declaration was made, requiring international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not need international assistance, so it is a bit of a challenging matter", Mr. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is uncertain if staff from abroad will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopoora, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said: Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation to see whether or not international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Although Indonesia is routinely hit by earthquakes, it is clear that the country is not prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami housing has been built in Aceh, but is rare in coastal areas.
Although the tsunami was expected, the lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu meant that casualties could not be avoided.
In normal times, travel between many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters complicate transportation even more.
The hospital in Lombok has travelled to the port of Palou to treat the earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Joko is running out of money to run for re-election next year.
Joko has also been facing sectarian unrest in Indonesia, where many Muslims are following a narrow view of their faith.
More than 1,000 people have died and thousands more have been displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other improvised weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a spectacular goal against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge avoided a loss to Liverpool's Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute in the Football Premier League final at Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
If it was a 1-0 goal, Stridge's side were about 30 yards out of Chelsea's goal and accepted a pass from Jer Don Shakiri.
He tapped it to his left before scooping the ball to the far post.
His jerking caused the ball to bounce higher than the box and fall towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed over the head of Kepa Arizabalaga, who was jumping to stop it, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get control of the ball by standing in a proper position and players like Shaq always play the ball as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible", Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Canté coming, but I touched him once and then I wet the ball".
Chelsea scored 1-0 at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
Matteo Kovacic threw the ball towards the Blues striker before he went to the midfield and ran towards Liverpool Pool.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go in midfield.
He then made the ball fall into Hazard's box by throwing it beautifully.
Hazard also went to the end of the post-net and hit the ball with his left foot to pass Liverpool's Alison Baker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videotone in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
The 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday produced waves as high as 20 feet and trapped many people under rubber piles of collapsed buildings, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was littered with rubber waste from collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman died from a knife wound.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman's body was found near Grayson Muse at 7.55am on John Street with stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the latter.
The police have asked people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages, although I would ask that you contact us if you see or hear anything suspicious in John Street, Birkenhead.
Also, the main thing we ask from taxi drivers is that they may have captured something in the dash cam footage of their vehicle that could provide key information in our investigation. So contact us.'
The woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found within the boundaries of a property, police spokesperson said.
Friends of the deceased woman arrived at the scene this afternoon and are asking questions about where the body was found this morning.
The police said that the investigation is continuing and the police have made efforts to inform the close relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver in Grayson Moose tried to enter his flat but no one was allowed to enter or exit the building, police said.
He knew what had happened there and did not say anything.
Residents are expected to be allowed inside the building in a few hours.
I heard a police officer tell a person that the whole place is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman arrived at the scene in tears.
'This is a terrible thing,' she keeps saying.
By 2 pm, two police vans were inside the cordon or police fence, while another van was parked outside.
Several police officers inside the cordon were patrolling the blocks of flats.
Anyone with information is requested to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 by entering log 247 of 30th September.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament is a recent monument to the controversy of 'making new history'
The boycott would do justice to many of England's cultural and religious artifacts destroyed by Cromwell's crazed Puritan followers in Taliban-style fashion.
But the Cramwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to distort history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cramwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would discuss whether the Oliver Cramwell statue outside Westminster Palace would be the subject of controversy.
Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out the sculpture-making operation during the English Civil Wars.
Cromwell's ancestor, Thomas, may have been a victim of unnecessary sacrifice for his actions in the last century.
Sir William Hammock Thornycroft represented Cromwell as a mirror to 19th-century popular opinion and is part of a personality historiography that many believe can still be revered today.
"In the latter part of the 19th century Cromwell was held in high esteem compared with today", said Mr Goldsmith in the Sunday Telegraph, "for his efforts to protect Parliament from the external pressures of the monarchy.
But whether it was accurately represented in its entirety is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century led to the further development of our nation, and the only fact is that Cromwell is the only known figure to represent one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector should be celebrated and remembered".
The Chinese farmer was bitten by a killer pig.
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, who was found in a pool of blood in a market pigsty in Lupang Shui, Gizhou province, was identified only by his nickname "Yuan", and his arteries were severed, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a farmer was preparing to vaccinate all the pigs in a pig farm.
According to a report, he came to the market on Wednesday from the neighboring Yunnan province with his cousin to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his brother's relatives saw him dead and saw the doors of the adjacent pigsty open.
He told me that the big male pigs in the pigsty were bleeding.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig bit the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and were deformed", said a relative of the deceased, who was nicknamed "Wu", to the Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
An hour later, his body was found.
The animal that killed Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that while the police were laying evidence at the scene, the pig was restrained from attacking anyone.
The report said that Yuan's family members and marketing officials have been in talks to compensate him for his death.
Although such incidents are rare, there have been previously recorded cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their garden and inflicted severe injuries on the man's face.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig farmer in Wales was trying to injure his tractor when his wife scared him off.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually prone to attack, but the taste of blood can "trigger" them.
"They are playing.
They are like little children, very curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
If you show proper respect to them, they will be treated with respect".
Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring heavy rainfall across the southwestern US.
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening in the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall across northern Mexico and the southwestern US in the coming days.
As of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph, and was seen as far as 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is taking a ring shape over the Pacific Ocean and heading eastward toward the west coast of the US. It will approach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, penetrating the southwestern US and pushing tropical moisture northward.
Rosa is expected to rain up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humidity reacting with the approaching cyclone will bring widespread hail in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall falling in the desert creates dangerous avalanches, leaching of waste and landslides.
Extreme tropical humidity causes 2 to 3 inches of rainfall per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, mainly over much of Arizona.
The rainfall in the tropics can be very high and can cause flooding due to erosion.
It is very dangerous to walk in the desert because of the tropical rain.
Heavy rain turns deep ditches into flowing rivers and locally strong winds and dust appear from cyclonic rains.
The approaching spiral storm will bring locally heavy rainfall to the Southern California coastal region.
A little more than half an inch of rainfall can cause some debris to leak and make roads slippery.
This will be the first rainfall of the monsoon season in the region.
Some tropical showers will move into Arizona on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, then spread throughout Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rainfall in all four directions will start on Tuesday and continue till Wednesday.
Arctic cooling in October will cause temperature fluctuations throughout the US, but warm weather will continue in the tropics.
Sometimes this will cause a lot of temperature changes in short intervals.
Several temperature variations were seen across the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the summer heat will continue and spread widely.
Central and eastern parts of the US start October with hot temperatures and are expected to experience temperatures of 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City will reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees above the average temperature.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that temperatures are likely to be above average in the eastern US in the early days of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kevano court case
The thrilling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his 1980 sexual assault accuser Christine Blasey Ford was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political row continued by blocking broadcasters from airing the trial that was set to end on Friday: the result of Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI to hold a week-long hearing on the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was 100 percent true that Kevano grabbed her drunk and tried to strip her during a high school party.
In his strong testimony, Kevano said that it was 100 percent true that it did not happen.
It is likely to have been seen by more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which aired the evidence, did not have the figures immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has a little trouble counting the people watching in offices.
In a way, the audience for the hearing was the same as the audience for a football game or an Academy Awards.
Several people at Fox News Channel expressed support for Kevano's appointment, Nielsen said, leading all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day of court hearings.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest of the people after the hearing doubled.
Flake was the focus of the fight on Friday.
After a statement from the general Republican office that he would vote for Kevano was released, he was targeted by CNN and CBS cameras as he entered the elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday morning and opponents shouted slogans against him.
He was humiliated on CNN live and did not look up for several minutes.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said a woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "When so many women are weak, you are strong".
Flake said a statement was issued from his office and that he had much to say at the committee hearing before the elevator doors closed.
Cable and broadcast networks then carried live coverage, during which the Judiciary Committee was voting on the subject of Kevano's nomination with the intention of sending it to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominees next week at the request of the minority Democratic Party.
Flake was partially persuaded by the words of his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After speaking with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was strong, as it was clear that Republicans could not vote to approve Kevano until the trial was over.
President Trump has assigned the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kevano.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing a political game" against the backdrop of her plans to leave the European Union, regardless of Britain's future and national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Convention in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In her interview, published alongside May's interview on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said that May's statement that the Chequers had a Brexit plan and that Britain and the EU should collect their tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wade Sims shooting case: Police arrest Deaton Simpson suspected of killing LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the case of 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims, who was killed in a fatal shooting at LSU.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the collision between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims lost his glasses during the collision.
CBS affiliate WAFB reported that police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson confessed to shooting and killing Wade after being questioned, police said.
According to the lawyer's report, his bond was worth $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office, which released an initial report on Friday, said the death was caused by a bullet passing through the head and entering the neck.
The department also congratulated the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and citizens of the area for their cooperation in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Aleva, LSU athletic director, thanked law enforcement in the area for "diligence and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, said the team was "shocked" and "in shock" by Wade's death.
"You're always worried about this", Wade said.
The ash from the volcano is being poured over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it saw increased activity in the craters and 183 gas emissions and ash over a 24-hour period.
The centre was monitoring many sounds and vibrations.
Images on social media showed layers of thin ash coating on car windshields in Xochimilco, a city near Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police in Barcelona on Saturday, and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatists intercepted by riot police threw eggs and powdered paint at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The clashes started again when the police used their batons to control the riot.
For several hours pro-independence groups shouted "Forget not, forgive not", while the unionist protesters chanted "Long live Spain".
According to local newspaper reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protest.
Tensions have risen in the pro-independence region a year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but separatist Catalans celebrated.
The voters chose to be independent in large numbers, although the number of people who came was very small, as the anti-separationists largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups had been positioned late Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The exhibition was successful but it had to take a different path.
Narcis Terms, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about the chances of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we witnessed one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they were able to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite Labor's victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties are struggling to maintain their momentum this year as many of their prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, and said he believed the clash was instigated by politicians on both sides.
"It is getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the oppression in democratic values and the oppression we face from the Spanish government", he said.
London Derry: People arrested after car broke into home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly slammed into a house in Derry, London.
The incident took place at Balinagard Crescent at around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Debt inspector Bob Blemings said that the gates and building were damaged.
At one point, a CDB may have been fired at the car.
Minga Strike won 1-0 against Rangers for Livingston
Daly Menga's first goal for Livingston scored the winner.
The promoted Livingston surprised Rangers by surrendering Steven Gerrard to only the second defeat in his 18 games as manager of Ibrox Club.
Daly Menga's strike made the difference as Gary Holt's team tied Hibernian for second place.
Gerrard remained winless in the season premiership and next Sunday they face leaders Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have extended their unbeaten run in this division to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against tough interviews
Holt's team had to be ahead before he scored, because his straight walk was causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but struggled in his attempt when the goal was scored, then Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his effort wide as he slid across the goal to block Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, as they knew they could disturb the visitors at other times.
And the decisive goal came in the same way.
Rangers gave up a free-kick and Livingston scored an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson rallied to face Minga, who took the touch and scored from the middle of the box.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the parade but the home defense was invincible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untouched,
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos grabbed a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied a chance by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Leith Go flicked wide from another Livingston set play.
Crosses came constantly in the Living Stone box and were constantly cleared, but two penalty claims - one after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton and one after a handball - were moved away.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - An Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony MacArthur Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
For a man, he was excellent, and he continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
His style of play and staff have not changed since he returned to the top flight, but Holt has to be congratulated for the way he has equipped the team since he arrived.
There are many heroes there.
Captain Halkett was immense, he led the best of the best organized defense, but the manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Voral busy all the time.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although he sometimes played as well as he did under Gerard, he was below those standards.
They were missing the final ball - they had only broken through the home side once - and this was a wake-up call for Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for lunch in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), there were smiles and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at mending relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne for the inauguration of a massive new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Despite the police citing security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, enough supporters gathered to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - expressed their protest, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
These dual protests reflect the division of the audience, which is hailed as heroic by some German Turks and vilified as dictatorial by others.
Deep Ford Road Accident: Cyclist killed after colliding with car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, on the southeastern side of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and the man died at the scene, although paramedics took care of him.
The accident follows the death of another cyclist in a hit-and-run accident a month ago on Childress Street, a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
He said that Metropolitan Police is working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Road closures and bus turns have been put in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officers were injured in the incident at the high security men's prison, the prison office said.
The chaos broke out at around 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to control the riot, which involves eight prisoners and one ward.
The officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Specialised trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and they will spend even more time in jail".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison governor was reportedly treated in hospital after being assaulted by a prisoner.
And riot officials were called to jail in October last year when staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa poses flash flooding threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (poor areas may benefit)
Tropical depressions are rare to hit Arizona, but this increases the risks of flash flooding as Hurricane Rosa is likely to drain its remaining strength into the Desert Southwest next week.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood observations for Monday and Tuesday in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah from western Arizona, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is projected to hit Phoenix directly on Tuesday, arriving late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet: "Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or airstrip status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ boundary".
Recent National Hurricane Center models estimated 2 to 4 inches of precipitation with isolated amounts of 6 inches on the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches, with isolated amounts likely to be up to 4 inches.
For those outside the flash flood risk, the area being a drought-stricken area can prove to be a blessing in disguise.
While flooding is a very serious concern, this rainfall may be of some benefit as the South West is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drift Monitor, 40 percent of people in Arizona are experiencing at least severe drought, the second highest category", weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will cause a landslide on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which was still in storm strength with peak winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is facing cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore its strength is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening in tropical storm strength.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Three to six inches of rain are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and it could be as much as 10 inches", weather.com reports.
Rosa then moved north across Mexico before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical storm, and it moved through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause deadly flash flooding and cause debris to flow in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Mid-Summer Norton attack: Four arrested in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and another 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in a summer set.
A teenage boy was found in an injured condition in the Excelsior Terrace area of Mid Somers Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he was said to be in a "stable" condition.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the area of Rodstock last night.
The officials have requested anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh felt the "corruption and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and extremist tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh felt the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his candidacy.
Kavanagh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the allegation that a man named Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at his trial about his allegation.
The President said on Saturday that the Americans witnessed Kavanaugh's "wonder and quality and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal experts of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant record in public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President indirectly mentioned Kavanagh's nomination.
"We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
I am not running, but I am really running", he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for the best candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats aim to "opposed and deter".
A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote of the Senate session on Kavanagh's nomination is expected to take place later on Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami and the death toll is expected to rise.
At least 384 people were killed and many more washed up as giant waves washed up on the beaches when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the beach at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still active on the beach and they didn't run immediately and they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come by itself, it pulled cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami travelled at 800 kilometers per hour (497 mph) in the open sea before hitting shore.
He said that some climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors that followed the earthquake continued in the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
A statement by Indonesia's Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said the geography of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Ngroho said that the area of Donggala, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, near the epicentre of the earthquake, could be the most deadly and damaged.
"Communications are completely weakened with no information from Donggala", said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse", it said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for not reporting that Palu had been hit by a tsunami, but the waves struck as a warning, officials said.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of the building can be heard loudly shouting warnings about an approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, and this made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations by cutting communications around the palace.
The army has started sending cargo flights to Jakarta and other cities to provide aid, officials said, but the evacuees are in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief operations only and will remain closed till October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami casualties are more than 800.
This is very bad.
World Vision personnel from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu where the employees have been sheltered in tarpaulin shelters set up in their office premises and have seen devastating scenes as they have been en route, said Shri Doseba.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
Some complained that even though relief groups had started serious disaster relief work, foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from travelling to Paluk.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign aid, supplies and personnel can only be allowed to enter the disaster area if it is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Alia Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government said 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we could open up for international help but there is still no position on it".
As the second night on the cusp of Friday's earthquake and tsunami comes, friends and families of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones may be miracles blinking the lines of the dense story of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the mudstone next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendhen Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had been training two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The people trapped at Rowa Hotel, including Shri Mandgi, are his students.
"As a veteran in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled that within hours of the news of the Rowa Hotel collapse spreading in the paragliding community, he sent WhatsApp messages in a frenzy to the Palu competitors attending the beach festival.
His messages, instead of a pair of blue check marks, turned into just one gray check mark.
"This means the messages have not been delivered", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refill at Levi's in Newport
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's workers while refilling an ATM in Newport.
The driver of the car was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more cash, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was engaged, another man "ran from behind the employee of the brink" and stole the bag of money intended for delivery.
According to a press release, witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "I am officially called Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Yea for a while and used that name for the title of my eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to introduce her new album Yandy.
The creators of the show said that she is a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for emotional reasons.
In addition to being a shortened form of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'yea' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year on radio host Big Boy, discussing the title of his album.
"So I am you, I am we, that is us.
It's gone from being the one, the only, to the only - and it's a reflection of our good, our bad, our mess, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are".
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West organizers, Jay-Z, have also added hyphens and capitalizations or are running without them.
Amlo, Mexico, vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of its bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tletelolco Plaza on Saturday that "the military will never be used to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, during the height of left-wing student movements across Latin America, soldiers opened fire and killed 300 people during a peaceful demonstration in the plaza.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract youth towards criminal groups.
US should double AI funding
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field.
The notes come after various parts of the US government made AI announcements, even though the US does not have a formal AI strategy overall.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: It aims to become No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget is a good start as all other countries are far behind the US and we are exploring the next innovation in AI", Lee said.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being in the US.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has also invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the American Othello Player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has hosted past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next inventor.
Lee said researchers in the US would have to work harder to win government grants.
"It's not China that is taking the educational leaders; it's the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired scholars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy will also help the US to boost its AI efforts.
"I think that PhDs in AI should be given green cards automatically", he said.
China's State Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Li said that while China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the US provide funding to US researchers, the quality of academic work in China is poor.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which was intended to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of an AI Select Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation seeking to create an artificial intelligence national security commission has seen no progress in several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked membership efforts for the European Union and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbor as a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gorz Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, raising doubts that the boycott campaign will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum is: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by ratifying the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Joran Jave, argue that it is a price to pay to enable Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the repression of Yugoslavia, to gain access to institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, to enable young Macedonians to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this is the foundation of a safe life for all of us", said Oliveira Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
While not required to do so by law, many MPs have said that they are committed to making the outcome of the vote decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no irregularities were reported as of 1 pm.
However, the turnout in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjos Tanjevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Joran Jav, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small platform and laying chairs in front of tents set up by the boycottors of the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door", Kavadorkov said.
"We are a poor country but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia as part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Jev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour of it, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", said Jev after casting his ballot.
He said the result of the "Yes" vote was "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters participate in the referendum - less than the required voting.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of people plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
A referendum needs 50 percent of the people and one vote to succeed.
The failure of the referendum represents the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through the full Brighton defence for the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dusted off Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it very easy to see in his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before attacking in the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He went around a defender and then overtook even more people at the Brighton box end.
Then when he pushed the pass to the left, there was Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch at the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to trick Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and hit him to the right of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing him 55, 60 minutes.
Now it is.
He was lucky to score in that moment".
But it was Stirling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent a beautiful throw ball along the left flank to Leroy San.
San took a few touches before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blue forward, shortly before falling down, put the ball into the net.
City will play Hafenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sin-Schim, Germany.
Spoiler versus. Scherzer wants to play the Rockies
With the Nationals out of playoff contention, there was little interest in another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to fight the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, on the condition that the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, have playoff implications.
The Rockies have earned a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to win their first division title.
Even if we're just playing, with people who know the atmosphere of Denver, and can rub their fingers in the rubber, and other teams might be playing at the highest level I can face this year.
Why Should I Not Compete?
The Nationals have yet to announce another starter for Sunday, but, in such a scenario, it is likely that Scherzer will be allowed to pitch.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, started the bullpen session on Thursday and will take a normal rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump leads in West Virginia
The Supreme Court has indirectly referred to the controversy over his choice of Brett Kavanaugh, the president, when speaking about the importance of Republican votes in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done will bear fruit in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lifetime.
This is very important. I am not contesting this election, but I am contesting the election. That is why I am fighting for the candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You're looking at a very horrible situation, you're looking at a bunch of hateful Democrats.
They are ready to seize power by any means, even the meanest.
They ride on anyone they want to get pain, power and control, they just want power and control, but we don't give them that power.
He said the Democrats are using a "resistance and disruption" tactic.
"You have seen in the last four days" Democrats are "angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest".
He also mentioned the name of Sen. Diane Feinstein, a Democrat who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you had a record leak?
Oh, what the hell.
No, no, no, her body language was worse than that.
Labor is no longer a large church.
If they speak their mind, it becomes intolerance
When the activists of my local party, Momentum, voted for me, it was a real surprise.
I am the latest addition to the list of Labour MPs who have pushed us away for speaking our minds.
My fellow MP, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way for speaking out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor position criticized me for having a disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy had disagreements with previous leaders on responsible economic policy, national security, European importance and other issues.
Nottingham East Labour's Friday meeting notice said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
The GC meeting on Friday night was as I have seen it in the last eight years as a local Labour MP.
Sadly, the congregation today has not sounded like most other congregations. The promise of "a mild, peaceful" politics has been forgotten.
The situation in the Labour Party is becoming intolerant of dissent, and each opinion is considered on the basis of whether it is in line with the party leadership.
It's starting as Jeremy becomes the leader, whether it's national security or the EU single market, everything, I, my colleagues who previously shared a similar view, now expect the stance to change.
Every time I speak, every time I speak in public, there is a barrage of insults on social media, saying that I should be abandoned, that I am harming the politics of the Centre and that I should not be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues that the comments made about me are politically motivated.
I am amazed at the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues who face sexual or racial harassment every day and are not discouraged.
The most tiresome thing about politics in this era is that the low rate of violence has gone naturally.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, we don't have that broad mindset yet, and we're getting narrower with every "disbelief" attitude or policy change.
I have received a lot of advice in the last two years to keep my head down, not talk too much and I have to have an "all is well" mindset.
But I have not come to politics for this.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, I have opposed the Thatcher government's negligence that has ruined entire classrooms, and it has played a significant role in providing better public service to those in need, whether they are local councillors or government ministers.
I have not hidden anything in my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is in any way confused about my policy stance and my differences with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to those who supported the Friday stance that the country is moving towards Brexit, which will affect families, businesses, and our public service, and therefore I see no need to spend my time and effort to show my sincerity to the Labour Party leaders.
But I am not a Nottingham Momentum, but rather a message to the people of my constituency, whether or not I am a Labour Party member: I am proud to serve you and no option, no threats of cancellation or political advantage will deter me from working as I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
AIR 38 - 17 Merlos: Undefeated AIR lead
The delayed two attempts seemed to have some impact on the final result, but there was no doubt that AIR deserved an unprecedented win in the Premier Day match of the amazing entertainment Tencent.
They are the only ones who have not lost in the top ten.
In the end, it was his aggressive defense and chances-taking that kept the home side and coach Peter Murchi happy at every turn.
"We have played till now but we are not defeated. I am happy", he said.
"Congratulations to AIR, they have taken better chances than we have", says Robin Christie of Melrose.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute effort was converted by Frazier Klimo, sending A.Y.R. forward. However, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes turned the game around for Warrior, allowing Melrose to make the numbers, and Jason Baggott received an unconverted try.
Klimo made a penalty to A.Y.R., and converted a solo try to make A.Y.R. 17-5 at the break before the interval.
However, Melrose started well after the interval, and Baggott converted Patrick Anderson's try to close the gap by five points.
After playing for too long, Rourke Nutt was injured and was stretched off, and when it resumed, AIR took the lead via a Stafford McDowell try converted by Climo.
AIR's interim captain, Blair MacPherson, then received a yellow card and Melrose had to pay extra man-to-man due to Bruce Calvin's unconverted try at the end of the re-stress.
McPherson was blocked from carrying the AYR lead from the penalty line when Strawban gave a yellow card to Hutchin-Sun to trap Climo without the ball.
Klimt converted the box kick of David Armstrong, as he did when Kyle Rowe sent Greer Henry to the flanker for the home side's fifth try, and from the restart.
The still game star is looking forward to a new opportunity in the restaurant industry
After learning that he has been named a director at a licensed restaurant company, Still Game star Fort Kieran is looking forward to stepping into the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, for which he wrote the screenplay and starred alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have already announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last, and it looks like Keiran is thinking about her life after Craigslist.
According to the official record listing, he is a director of Adrift Morn Ltd.
Although Scottish Sun sources have said he wants to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant trade", the actor has declined to comment on the news.
'The sea is ours': Bolivian island hopes court can reopen road to Pacific
The Navy is waiting to guard the Naval Headquarters at La Paz.
The navy blue flag is flying over the government buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are committed to the motto: "The sea is ours.
It is our duty to withdraw it".
The island of Bolivia ceded its coastline to Chile in the 19th century war. Thus, the desire of Bolivia to sail in the Pacific Ocean is still in force.
After five years of trial, Bolivia is looking forward to the ruling of the International Court of Justice on October 1.
"Bolivia has a spirit and a mission of integrity, and therefore, we expect a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
People in Bolivia will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country. Bolivia hopes that the tribunal in The Hague will deliver a ruling after decades of negotiations that Chile should negotiate the transfer of maritime jurisdiction to Bolivia.
Bolivia's popular president, Evo Morales, who is seeking re-election next year amid a contentious fight, also has high hopes for Monday's decision.
"We are close to the process of withdrawing the Pacific Ocean", he said last August.
However, according to some analysts, the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia and if it does, the change is very small.
The UN Council in the Netherlands has no authority to decide on the Chilean territory and cannot predict the outcome of any negotiations.
As the ICJ's decision comes six months after the final argument, Chilean international law expert Paj Zarate said: "This case is not complicated".
The situation in the last four years has not been conducive to Bolivia's mission.
"The Bolivian government has hijacked the problem of access to the sea", says Zarate.
She says Morales' statements have lost the respect that remains for Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks in one scenario, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
The Bolivian representative at The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltje, has rejected the accusation that the court's decision-making process is speeding up questionably.
"The verdict on Monday will provide an opportunity to forge a new relationship with Chile and end 139 years of mutual discord", he said.
Calzadilla denies that Morales, still the most popular president in Latin America, is using the ocean for political purposes.
"Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean will never be given up", he said.
"This verdict is an opportunity to right the wrongs of the past".
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament is impossible without trust in the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong said that our country would never destroy a nuclear weapon without first trusting Washington.
Ri was addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the US to follow through on the commitments made by the leaders of both countries at their meeting in Singapore.
The statement comes as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he expected the resumption of nuclear diplomacy three months after talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was only a dream that North Korea could be defeated by the US's objection to the posture of ending the Korean War while continuing the embargo.
Pyongyang does not disarm first, Washington is wary of announcing a treaty
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But Pyongyang, which believes that its security is only about weapons, is widely believed to be rebuilding its weapons.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Coming to your nearest high street is a charming headdress unveiled at the Paris fashion show.
If you need to change your hat collection or to avoid sunburn, do not look back.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown have unveiled their unique large-size SS19 collection in a stylish set at Paris Fashion Week.
The most bizarre hats were popular on Instagram this summer and caught the eye of designers, including Cat Walk.
Valentino has a design that resembles a blanket with a wide circumference like a wing that decorates the models' heads.
Other larger-sized accessories include fancy turmeric, a lizard hat, and a pineapple. However, they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown has also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the attractive masks are lip-stitched and look more like Hannibal Lecter than a Hatte Cocher.
One is a creation that looks like scuba diving gear, with snorkels and goggles, and the other is a mask that looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're a fashion lover, you can find your favorite here.
Fashion lovers have speculated that it will attract you to the nearby high street because of its attractive bonnets.
Large-sized hats are in the La Bomba style. The two-foot-wide brimmed straw hat can be seen on everyone's head from Rihanna to Emily Rathke Jovski.
The unrealistic cult label hat has been a hit on social media, and has also been featured on Cat Walk. The straw beach bag is as big as the model in the swimsuit.
The Burnt Orange Raphia Bag features a Raphia fringe and a white leather handle. It is the exclusive product of the Jacques La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells Femme: "I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the high street by next summer. Designers have made such a huge impression that the demand for large-size accessories cannot be ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are needed for global citizenship
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence and, with the addition of another unique test result in 2018, are further empowered through individual and cumulative success in sport, the arts, music and other community contexts.
With 30,000 children in Scotland, these schools are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and strive to provide the highest quality of service to their children and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare children for higher education, careers of their choice and to grow as global citizens.
In the educational sector, which designs and implements the school curriculum, we can see that modern languages are constantly gaining popularity and are a subject in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to someone in a tongue, you speak to his heart.
It reminds us that when we want to build relationships and build trust among people of other countries, we should not rely on English alone.
From the recent test results this year, we can see that languages with the highest pass rate in independent schools are the most prominent.
68% of the children who studied a foreign language achieved an A grade above.
According to data collected from 74 member schools of the SCI, 72% of children studying Mandarin have achieved the highest A-grade, 72% of children studying German, 69% of children studying French and 63% of children studying Spanish have achieved A-grade.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland are undoubtedly encouraging foreign languages as a key skill for children and young people in the future.
Languages are now considered as subjects of choice in the Independent School Curriculum and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of people who struggle to fill jobs lack language skills.
Thus, more and more language skills are essential for young people to shape their careers.
Language skills are becoming a necessity in a globalised world where more jobs require them.
Regardless of profession, if someone chooses to learn a second language, they will have the real benefit of having this kind of lifelong skill.
The ability to interact directly with people from abroad will naturally put a person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of them cannot speak a foreign language when conversing, and only two percent, or 15 percent, speak French.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for today's children.
If there are multiple languages in developing countries, it will provide a better opportunity for children to find better jobs.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
While many schools focus on classical modern languages, as of 2020, other schools teach languages of great importance to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your children's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools and there will be teachers who are specialized in them.
Scottish independent schools are specialised in providing learning environments and they build environments where, whatever their prospects, they develop the skills needed to succeed and prepare children.
There is no denying that language will continue to be a key factor in the global business environment and this must be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages are truly international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and expertise to Scotland's young people.
This is the way it should be.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is set to make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
Fans' expectations for LeBron James' first game at the Los Angeles Lakers are finally over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is yet to be decided.
"It's probably more than one but less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James could play for a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked what his plan was for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
He said, "At this point in my career, I don't need Pre-Season Games to be ready.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has opened campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, with stops in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump now intends to seek support as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the midterm elections are held in November.
What is the time of Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
The time of Trump's West Virginia Wheeling rally is 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via a live stream on YouTube.
This week's Supreme Court nomination Brett Kavanaugh is likely to be mentioned at a Trump rally, a sensitive issue that is expected to hold up Senate confirmation votes for those being investigated by the FBI over sexual misconduct.
But the primary priority of these rallies is to encourage Republicans in the November election.
So the five rallies next week are seen by President Trump's campaigns as an incentive for volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the Republican majority in the Senate and Congress.
Since controlling the House is at the top of his agenda, Trump wants to enter as many states as possible, keeping him busy during the campaign season, a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The tonight rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could also invite Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and receive Pittsburgh media coverage, West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump is visiting West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, after winning the state with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump has sought to help defeated West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morris.
Simon Haider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said that Trump's appearance as a campaign incentive was not a good sign for Morris, Reuters reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has struggled to hold on to expectations, facing Sunday's singles
After three convergence sessions, the Saturday afternoon quadruple was needed for the Ryder Cup.
The pendulum-like situation of running had completely changed the sport, but this was the race that the athletes really believed in and competed in.
So, which way is the wind blowing now?
"They were six points ahead, but now it's down to four, so we're just a little bit ahead", Jordan Speith said.
Europe is certainly ahead by four points and still has 12 to go.
According to Speeth, Americans, who have low airflow rates on their side, feel encouraged by many things. Speeth and Justin Thomas were all day, each down four to three points.
Speeth has played as a tough-tackling midfielder from tee to green and is a leading model.
The match went into a complicated stage in all four rounds when he and Thomas were down two after each other.
His put put made the same scream as the win in Game 15. This indicates that the US team did not leave.
This shows that you are more concerned about your match.
That is why all the players have left now.
There are now 18 holes to be completed.
The only players to score more than Speith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird but favorite couple is four by four and they can do no wrong.
The only couple not to shoot a Saturday afternoon bogie is Bollywood, who have left the bogie on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and returned at nineam on Friday.
That run and the energy they have suggested that the players will win the match on Sunday, and that the public is supporting it. Europe's victory is more apparent than Fleetwood or Molinari's when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
In different holes at the same time.
It is not right to talk about European victory now.
Sergio Garcia's short work on the morning four-ball hero Sergio Garcia while playing with Alex Noreen is done by Bubba Watson and Web Simpson.
A bogey and two doubles in the front nine encouraged the Spaniard and the Swede to the hole as never before achieved.
On Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
Four balls and four sums are very attractive to watch because the communication between the pair and the advice they give and the advice they don't give and the changing strategy is important.
Europe played well as a team and took a significant lead on the final day. However, this Four-Sum Session showed that Team USA has the ability to make a fight that was doubtful.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe has gained a healthy lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after taking a 10-6 lead over the United States in the Four Balls and Four Sum on Saturday.
The pair, encouraged by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, have now reached four points at Le Golf National, with two wins against Tiger Woods, who are trying to match Talley.
Thomas Bjorn's European is trying to regain the trophy after losing at Hazeltine two years ago. The series is 3-1 due to the USA missing the morning fours ball.
The U.S. showed more resilience in the Four Sum, winning two matches, but they were unable to make up the deficit.
The Jim Furyk side need eight points to hold the trophy from Sunday's 12 singles match.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, known as the "Mollywoods", became the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup after a spectacular weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid at the Four Balls, American rookie Bryson DeChambeau and Woods were defeated by an even more impressive 5-4 to the Wildcats.
Woods, who lost two matches on Saturday, was often a prolific player. However, he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in the Four Balls and Four Sum and has lost seven in a row.
After resting in the morning Four Balls, Justin Rose, Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson came together in the Four Sum to defeat Brooks Koppka 2-1 and he is ranked first and third in the world.
The road to Europe was not smooth, and he lost in Paris-Sud-Ouest.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas set a milestone for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
He won 2-1 against Spain's John Ram and Lan Poulter in the Four Balls and then defeated Poulter and Rory McElroy 4-3 in the Four Summon after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup has the team been four points behind in singles, with a draw for Furyk to keep the trophy.
After being the second favorite in two days, every attack on Sunday seems to be more than this.
North Korea has said it will not destroy its weapons for any reason without confidence.
The ban has exceeded their trust in the United Nations and it is not possible for their country to voluntarily destroy nuclear weapons in such a scenario, the North Korean foreign minister said at the UN on Saturday.
Speaking at the UN Annual Meeting, Ryong Ho said North Korea had taken many "good steps" in recent years, including halting nuclear and missile tests, shutting down a nuclear test site and suspending nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we have not received any response from the US on this matter.
If we have no confidence in America, we have no confidence in our national security and we will not spontaneously destroy our nuclear weapons first.
Ri spoke of North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to its proposal to phase out its nuclear weapons, noting that it was not as opposed to doing so as it had been in the past.
Citing a joint statement issued by current US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, Ri said that Kim had made a commitment to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and that Trump had said the US was committed to North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States demands that Pyongyang destroy its nuclear weapons first.
The United States has refused to lift tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US is encouraging nuclear disarmament first, but increasing pressure through prohibition to achieve their goal, and the US is objecting to ending the war, Ri said.
It is the dream of those who do not know about us that we will be on our knees because of the ban.
But the problem is that the continuation of the ban is increasing the trust gap between us.
Ri made no mention of a second meeting between Kim and Trump, as cited by US leaders at the UN earlier this week.
Highlighting the highlights of three talks between South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and Kim in the last five months, the Minister said, "If South Korea had been the main player in this denuclearisation proposal and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a complex stage".
However, Ri's tone this year was quite different from last year's speech at the United Nations, where the UN was caught in a dilemma when President Trump called Kim "the evil rocket man" who was about to commit suicide after North Korea targeted the United States with its rockets.
Trump, who said last year he would "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim at the UN this year for his courageous efforts to destroy the nuclear arsenal, but said there was still a long way to go and that the ban would remain in place until North Korea was destroyed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying it would take two years, three years, or five years.
China and Russia have argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must be vigorously enforced until we fully, finally, know about verified nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but this last trip was not good for him.
Within hours, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, as he was denounced for making "pirate-like" demands on North Korea.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to demolish the missile site and nuclear complex if the US took "appropriate measures".
Kim said that Trump's security promises in Singapore were in addition to what he had said about "appropriate measures" he was looking forward to and that he was interested in continuing a good relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest
A new course is starting this year at Harvard University to counter the growing macho culture in undergraduate studies that is being overly sleepy due to caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'.
Students educated at the best university in the world do not have a basic understanding of how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Seisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first time the course has been offered in the United States.
He was inspired to take this course after giving a talk on the negative impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, a girl asked: 'Why am I being told this after all these years, when I am a senior?'
I was surprised when she said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, will explain to students how good sleep habits can help with academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the school's health services, said the school decided to introduce the course after seeing students being sleep deprived during the week.
Long-term courses include interactive activities.
One section features a picture of a dorm room where students click on coffee makers, screens, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insomnia affects sports and the importance of bedtime.
Another section discusses how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the premises with interactive signs encourages participants to think about the routine.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
We believe that just as you have a right to know about the consequences of choosing to smoke, you have a right to know about sleep", said Prof. Sisler.
While a culture that prides itself on reading all night still exists, insomnia is a growing problem due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students.
He said good quality sleep should be the secret weapon of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, and also help them avoid weight gain, which is a constant hunger as insomnia makes the brain hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Seissler design the course and took one of his classes during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course was eye-opening and inspired him to start courses across the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same programme of study before joining a competitive institution.
Students should set an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of bluelights emitted by electronic screens and LED lights. These lights will emit your circadian rhythm from the kilter, thus causing sleep problems, Professor Seisler recommends.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Minga goal defeated by Gerrard's team
The series continued with Steven Gerrard's Rangers losing 1-0 to another goal from Daly Menga in the game at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were attempting to record their first win since a 4-1 February victory at St Johnstone, but Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games was inflicted by Gary Holt's side, who lost to their team-leading Lady Boroughs Premiership side Hearts by eight points.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers, playing without inspiration, did not seem to equalize at any moment.
Rangers are now down to sixth, while Livingston have moved up to third and are only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
Line man Calum Spence suffered a head injury from a long-range throw, which is another shock to the Rangers.
Gerrard made eight changes to the squad which led Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, kept the same Levi's 11 that he had scored a point from Hearts last week. He was pleased that his well-prepared team had beaten the opponents at every stage.
Although Rangers dominated the ball, Livingston made the most of the opportunity.
Menga had only two minutes to score when his first lay-off sent Scott Pitman through Alan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs got a free-kick after skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only hitting at the back post.
Although the Rangers retained control, their final third game looked more promising than believable.
Alfredo Morelos felt that a quarter-hour mark penalty should be given due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thompson did not consider Colombia's requests.
Rangers only managed two first-half shots but were hampered by Former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's Lasana Cowlibaly's header and Ove Azaria's strike.
Livia's 34th-minute opener could be against the running game, no one can deny he deserves it.
Once again, the Rangers failed to counter Jacob's deep set-piece.
Scott Orfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher slashed the ball to Scott Robinson, waiting for him to pick up the manga for a simple ending.
It had an immediate effect as Gerrard switched bowling for Ryan Kent during the break and the winger slammed into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to play a game that audiences loved with Lithgow and Halkett with big big shots.
Holt could have taken the lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up to deny Jacob before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim from a dispute with Jacob but Thompson again walked away.
Calendar: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday morning calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiser was born in Germany.
He invented a method to detect and measure geyser radiation, eventually this device became known as a geyser counter.
Since then, the mainstream science of the Geyser Counter has also become a pop culture reference, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring the Kafkaesque scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the molecules emitted by the radiation in the minerals.
"I'm not going to lie to you", he says.
"Hans" Geiser died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
And this invention has kept his name alive.
A new cancer vaccine may boost the immune system to XC1R cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to kill XC-RG cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system identify malignant cells
This method involves removing immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory
Then they can re-inject the normal protein XC2 into many cancers.
The trial vaccine is showing promising results in cancer patients.
A woman who received a vaccine treatment that teaches the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory so that they can be given a common protein called HER2 to multiple cancers, and then re-injected.
'The results show that we have found a very promising vaccine,' said Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "causes the progression of a number of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Jay Berzofsky explained.
Learning how to take immune cells from patients and target cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Support for Trump from Kane West, who wore the mega hat after SNL.
It wasn't good.
The incident came after viewers attacked West for praising US President Donald Trump during a live broadcast on Saturday night and telling him to run again in 2020.
After performing his third song at night, he wore a Make America Great cap at Ghost Town, satirized the Democrat and expressed his support for Trump.
'When I talk to white people, they ask me many times: 'Why do you like Trump, isn't he racist?'
If I was concerned about racism, I would have left America.'
SNL began with a skit by Matt Damon in which Hollywood star Christine Blasey parodied Brett Kavanagh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was investigating allegations of sexual assault by Ford.
Although not a broadcast, West's satirical video was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock tried to mock West by posting.
He also said that West is finding it difficult to defend his hat in the back.
''They bullied me behind the scenes.
He said, 'Do not go on stage wearing a hat.'
I was bullied!
He said that I was not in the right mood,'" he said, according to The Washington Examiner.
West also said: 'Do you want to go on stage in the same mood?' 'You can't tell me whether or not to wear this Superman cap, I asked if you want me to continue.
Love and see.'
His statements were abused by the audience at least twice and embarrassed SNL cast members. According to a Variety report, one of the cast members said: 'The whole studio surrendered to silence.'
West took the stage as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Dressed in a Perrier bottle, West surprised many with his song I Love It.
The conservative group TPUSA supported West. Cadence Turner tweeted: 'For the brave souls: Thank you for performing at the group level.'
But Karen Hunter tweeted, "Simply put, West was as good as he was".
'But I do not believe in supporting a person who has an idealism that is harmful to my community (buying their music or clothing or supporting their 'art').
They are free.
We too, he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter, "I've changed my name and my name is now officially Kane West".
He was not the first person to change his name in this way. He was also the first to change his name like Didi, Puff Daddy, Puffy or P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Leon. Similarly, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then reverted to his former name Prince.
The Belfast restaurant was charged with murder.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident took place in Bellihakamore, police said.
The accused will appear in the Magistrates Court in Belfast on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will review the allegations.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington sparked a fight against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington, best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has been vocal about the concept of macho hero, saying that because of such roles on screen, boys often face a situation where they think that they will only get respect if they are tough.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that she felt 'something was wrong' and that action was needed against toxic masculinity in today's #MeToo era.
Kit, who is married to his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, said she intends to voice this issue.
He said that although he personally felt strongly about this, there was something wrong with masculinity.
'What are we teaching our boys as they grow up?'
He said that television is the reason for the rise of toxic masculinity and the male characters in it.
He went on to say: What is inspiration and what is learning?
What is it about TV and street information that makes young boys think they are men?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time. How do we change this?
The truth is, something is wrong with the young boys.'
He has said in an interview that when the sequel ends next summer, he will not be thinking about any Game of Thrones, saying that the battlefields and horse scenes are boring.
From November, Kit will star in the next installment of Sam Shepherd's True West, a story about a filmmaker and his bandit brother.
He has said that he would like to meet his wife Rose to get out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show, so in this way it provided me with my future family.
The role of Rose Kit was played by the love interest Wigrit in John Snow, a fantasy series that won an Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China has seen a 14% increase in AIDS cases
China has increased the number of people living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
Officials said that more than 8,20,000 people are living with AIDS.
More than 40,000 cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The significant change was that the majority of cases were found to be due to sexual contact.
Traditionally, blood transfusions have been the cause of the rapid spread of HIV in China.
Chinese health officials in Yunnan state said the HIV epidemic had been virtually eliminated.
Year-on-year, the number of HIV-AIDS cases in China has increased by 100,000.
In China's LGBT community, sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem.
Although homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, discrimination against the LGBT community continues.
Studies show that about 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Diseases are spread by not using proper protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, China has provided universal access to HIV medicine to eliminate the problem.
GOP senators say they have not leaked information, Maxine Waters, lashing out at 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy allegations'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday lashed out at allegations that one of her staffers posted personal information on Wikipedia pages about three Republican senators and laymen.
He said right-wing pundits and websites are spreading propaganda about it.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter, "Lies, lies and more ugly lies".
The information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Arin Hatch are both from Utah.
The information was discovered online on Thursday by an unknown person posted during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill.
The leak came shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
According to conservative sites Gateway Pandit and Red State, the IP addresses suggest that the source of the posts was the Water's Office and that members of the Water's staff may have posted the content.
'This anonymous allegation is completely false and malicious,' Waters said.
"My staff members, their identity, their security, all of this is exposed due to this fraudulent and false allegation.
He said, "This unknown allegation is a complete lie and malicious".
Waters' statement was immediately met with criticism online, with former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher among those who criticized it.
'This rejection is outrageous,' wrote Fleischer.
This shows that Waters is not eligible to be a member of Congress.
If someone is falsely accused, they do not need to be angry about it.
They don't have to be so aggressive.
He does not have to say that the accuser has malicious intentions.
They should be calm and patient.'
Fleisher seemed to be comparing Waters' response to a Democrat criticism of Justice Kavanaugh to that of Kavanaugh, who appeared to be furious by Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to impeach Waters in the midterm elections, shared his thoughts on Twitter.
'If this is true, it is big news,' he tweeted.
The authorities and law enforcement agencies have been informed about the fraudulent claims, Waters said in a statement.
'The identity of the perpetrators will be revealed,' Waters said, adding that 'those who have taken actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff will be held accountable under the law.'
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Spy film by Rowan Atkinson
The British cinema has been a major contributor to the genre since the early 1990s. The comedy series Johnny English, which began in 2003, was reborn in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it ironic self-parody that we have obviously done poorly as the nation's new export driver?
In any case, Johnny English, a pop-eyed, rubber-faced invalid, has a second license to update his stuff - a name that suggests that he designed the comedy structure for non-English speaking cinemas, above all.
He is of course a Daft Secret agent who has a bit of a knack for glamour despite his bizarre pretenses, his first contribution being the chorus of Mr. Bean and a note of the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was originally an international figure of the now-forgotten Barkley Clackard TV commercials, who had caused a stir among the public by waking up.
There were one or two happy moments during this recent JEE tour.
As I approached the Johnny English helicopter, I really liked to see him wearing a medieval suit and a rotor blade hovering near him.
Atkin Sun, gifted with physical gestures, was now shown to be comic, but the comedy seemed powerless and bizarre, especially compared to "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible, which now exactly contribute a piece of humor.
I think the humor in it was aimed more at children than adults and I felt Johnny English's Illucila's villains were not creative and focused and focused on the perfection of Bean's personality in the way Atkin Son's silent film did.
The more topical premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret web network, revealing the identities of all of Britain's agents in the field, much to the chagrin of agent officials on duty.
This will be the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and courageous individual, already suffering from a complete meltdown from political infamy: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Theresa-May role but there is little more to work on the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since each secretary has compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
The main point is to confuse Johnny English, who now works as a schoolteacher at some luxury institution, but to give him undocumented insights into how to operate in secret: some of the best jokes are to provide a school like the rock-type academy of English espionage.
English is brought back to the White Hall for an emergency presentation and is joined by a longtime sufferer of side kick bow, again conducted by Ben Miller.
Beau is now a married man who has hit on a submarine commander, a joke-hockey-sticks character, in which Vicky Pepper's dick is a bit of a waste.
Haggy Batman and Robin make terrible mistakes at Her Majesty's Secret Service, where they face off against Olga Kurylenko's beautiful feminist Fate Tale Ofelia Bulatova.
Not only that, the Prime Minister is in danger under a powerful tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: Sinister Jason Volta, managed by Jack Lacy.
English and Beau begin their act of satirical hi-zinks as waiters who set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle in Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure chaos to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with Volta's home interior.
The last sequence, of course, takes all the stops, but it's friendly and lively.
It's a moderate enough thing.
And I couldn't think of any other Johnny English film that the British film industry couldn't really do justice to Rowan Atkinson's talent.
Britain is planning to work four days a week but pay five days, but workers are rejecting it.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons work four days a week - but be paid for five.
The party wants company bosses to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees an extra day off.
This is where you see employees enjoying three days-a-weekend - yet taking home the same amount of pay.
The idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favour of workers, the sources said.
The Trade Union Congress has approved a shift to four days a week to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'Such work will not happen overnight but the four-day workweek is the Party's approach to balancing the economy on behalf of workers and is an aspiration that fits with the overall industrial strategy of the Party.'
As the Green Party pledged a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign, Labour would not be the first to endorse such an idea.
However, this ambition is not fully endorsed by the present Labour Party.
As one Labour Party member put it: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called a labor conference last week to work out a vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that the decision was made to return power to the 'faceless directors' and 'beneficiaries' in utilities.
Shadow Chancellor schemes may not get current shareholders in water companies their full stake back, as the Labour government can make 'cuts' based on perceived wrongdoing.
He secured a plan to include workers on company boards and create exclusive ownership funds for private sector firms to hand over 10 per cent shares to employees who will pocket annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Grahame, John Kennedy says, "60 Minutes", about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change his mind.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, and the bureau's findings have raised the question of whether any Republican senators can be persuaded to draw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Sense if the FBI could catch anything that would make John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"That is, no", said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to trial, I spoke to Judge Kavanagh.
I called them after it happened, and the charge came out, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, unwavering".
However, Graham's resolve was as firm as a rock.
"My mind is formed on Brett Kavanagh and it takes a dynamite charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it, referring to Christine Bresley Ford.
"And everyone they named was not verified by them.
It is 36 years old.
I didn't see any new change".
What is a Global Citizens' Festival and have you done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York hosts the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event that features a star-studded showcase and an equally impressive mission; to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Civic Festival will take to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also raise awareness about the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, announced in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive free tickets to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerts had to complete a number of tasks or volunteer, email a world leader, phone a call or anything else that would help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has global civilization been in 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the thought process of rewarding people with a free concert the real way to convince people to call, or another case of what's called "click vision" - do people think they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or being sent a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Civilization claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, which have different goals.
These actions have helped to motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth $37 billion, aimed at impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030, it said.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that safe-haven funds have so far directly affected around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments from Nutrition Nutrition, a Russia-based partnership that promises to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, include:
"With the support of the Russian government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracy Ullman, Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
After the Russian government took more than 5,000 steps to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions, the group said.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "How do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens Answer: "It's a very long and difficult road - sometimes we stumble and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Card B, Janelle Mooney will perform at this year's event in New York, which is hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as "blockade" to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
As the Washington Examiner reported, Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington would use its US Inland Navy to "necessarily" disguise Russian power in markets, including the Middle East.
Ginkke has alleged that Russia's involvement, mainly in Syria, is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government - a pretext to explore new and powerful markets.
"Because they are in the Middle East, I believe they want to be a mediating force in Eastern Europe, in the south-central part of Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"With our navy, the United States has that ability to ensure that sea lanes are open and blockade if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Mr. Zinke was addressing the participants at an event organized by the Consumer Power Alliance, which describes itself as the "voice of consumer power" in the US.
He went there to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, which he said were effectively the same.
"The economic option over Iran and Russia is more or less, to regulate and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as "a smart horse" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration has replaced Russia with the intention of exporting its liquefied natural gas to Europe, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that effect, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, will try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, was Berlin's "hostage" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is merely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe that we share the view of Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak that after his meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russia cannot be a tool for applying pressure and consumers will be able to choose suppliers.
The US stance has been met with a backlash from Germany, which has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading business organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to distance itself from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I had a big problem when a third state interfered in our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Confederation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator says Elizabeth Warren had "hard work" when running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would face running for president after the midterm elections on Saturday with "hard work".
At the town hall in Holyoke, Mass., Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and include the issue of women having a better position", she told the Hill.
"After November 6, I will work hard to run for president".
During the town hall Warren pressed President Donald Trump, saying, "He's taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has spoken out against criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote".
The poll, released on Thursday, showed that a majority of Warren's units do not plan to run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Center for Political Research/Boston Globe poll, fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters have stated that a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported such a contest.
A poll of the race by former Governor Deval Patrick showed high support, with 38 percent of people having a potential drive and 48 percent support.
Other top Democratic names discussed in connection with the 2020 eventuality include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Tracking Palin's PTSD at a meeting with Donald Trump, Sarah Palin called out from power.
Track Paulin spent a year in Iraq after joining on September 26.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"I can relate to what my own son is doing, what he's doing after he returns, other families who are experiencing the severity of PTSD and families of our soldiers who have returned injured", she told the audience at a meeting for Donald in Lusa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his detention "the elephant in the room", and of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back with a firm mind, they come back with a respectful wonder about what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military has contributed to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, domestic violence against a female, interfering with a domestic violence report and seizing a weapon during a domestic violence report and rape, according to a spokesman for the Das Bennett Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support for new asylum policy challenge
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy of denying asylum to those fleeing robbery or domestic violence.
Friends of the Court filed a brief petition Friday in Washington, D.C., with representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia to challenge the policy and support asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
The full name of Grace v. Nancy Plaintiff. The suit of the session filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
She told her partner and the children of his violent gang members that she had been abused, but US authorities denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for states supporting Grace, including El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, explained that this creates a high number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as the nations face widespread problems with robbery and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants who did not flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"All claims to asylum must be determined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances under federal law, and such a list would violate that principle", the court's amicus brief stated.
Lawyers briefly argued that the policy of denying immigrants entry would hurt the U.S. economy, saying they were likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply needed workers".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judge to no longer shelter victims fleeing domestic violence and mass violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said of the June 11 policy.
Ashlam will never be able to solve all the problems faced by people all over the world every day and even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue efforts on the part of the race to find survivors double the death toll.
For the survivors, the situation was more dire.
"It's very stressful", said Reza Kusuma, 35, a mother, comforting a feverish son at an evacuation centre in Palu city.
"Ambulances are bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is very scarce".
The residents returned to their destroyed houses, picked up their submerged household items, and found out if anything was worth using.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals flooded by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including Dwai Harris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors due to lack of space.
He told his wife and children that the earthquake shook his fifth-floor hotel room, and his eyes filled with tears.
"We don't have time to defend ourselves.
I got caught in the debris of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, saying his family had gone to the town for a wedding.
"My wife begged for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' through propaganda ads
After a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US daily describing the benefits of China-US trade relations, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to achieve its goal.
A paid supplement to the U.S. Chinese daily appeared in Iowa's best-selling daily Des Moines Register on Wednesday, which President Donald Trump accused of being an attempt by China to influence the U.S. congressional elections that begin on November 6.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the US election was part of an effort to pressure China.
It is common for foreign governments to advertise in newspapers to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war and have moved to act by raising taxes on goods sold to each other.
Chinese and American manufacturers say China has imposed tariffs on American manufacturers in a way that gives a boost to exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party.
According to Terry Brynstad, US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, who is also a major agricultural exporter to China, China has targeted American workers, farmers and businesses.
According to Brian Stad in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now trying to cook its own beans by advertising in our free press".
"The tradition of free journalism in the United States has allowed China to be a bear", writes Brian Stead, "as evidenced by the advertisement in the Des Moines Register".
"In contrast, if you visit China at a newsstand on a street in Beijing, you will not find any comments against the economic hardships there, where the media is run under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
"One of China's leading newspapers was reluctant to publish my article", he said, without naming which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans who are alienating women voters over Kavanaugh case
Analysts have warned that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault allegations, will face fierce opposition from voters, especially women, in the upcoming midterm elections as he is defended by several top Republicans.
The sentiment is high, with most Republicans saying they want to vote.
There is no going back on those things", said Grant Recher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Senator Jeff Flake said he doubted that the FBI's last-minute attempt to investigate would be enough to anger angry voters.
"Women may not be able to forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or in November", said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group, MoveOn, to the Washington, D.C. Daily on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters demonstrated in the Senate's lobby chanting "November is coming!" and yet the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is unprecedented", said nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
"The people are saying that this is already the case.
But it may be higher, especially among women who change their party and young voters aged 18-29 who live in the suburbs, who don't like the president and often don't vote".
Analysts had said before Ford made a public statement about the sexual assault allegation against the Supreme Court nominee that Republicans could face stiff public opposition to pursue the nomination.
"It's complicated for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets to be on the bench, but how the Republicans handled the issue and how they looked after her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told a news channel.
The American public seems a little confused by the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, and most seem to be a little more pro-Ford.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41 percent of respondents said they believed what Ford said, while 35 percent said they believed what Kavanaugh said.
In addition, 38 percent thought Kavanaugh had lied during his trial, compared with 30 percent who thought Ford might have lied.
Ford's allegations are currently being investigated by the FBI after Flake's case was brought forward. Several other allegations against Kavanaugh were also made by another woman, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford has been accused by the Senate Judiciary Committee of sexually assaulting Ford while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh displayed his penis when he attended a party while they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Google and Facebook are the world wide web search engines
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is set to launch a new startup to take on Google, Facebook and Amazon.
The new project of technology legend Lee is to build Solid, an open source platform called Inrupt.
Solid allows users to control where data is stored and who can read what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the ultimate goal behind Inrupt is to rule the world".
"Let us do this now", he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
Using solid technology, people can create their own "personal online data store or pod".
It provides contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It works like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. It's all here in one browser at the same time.
The unique aspect of personal online data store is that who should use what is entirely user related.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
According to the company CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, methodology and skills to make Solid available everywhere.
The company currently has a community of developers hired to work on the security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking about Facebook and Google suddenly introducing a way to change their entire business.
"We don't have to ask their permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee said that the aim of Inrupt is to build a commercial power and operating environment that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid.
He revolutionized the Internet in 1994 with his invention of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become a very influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said he is very optimistic about the next era of the web.
Bernard Van: Memorial to the priest who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The priest, who was a recipient of the Victoria Cross as a soldier in World War I, was commemorated in his birthplace on his 100th birthday.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded the Victoria Cross for the raids on Bellingly and Leighcourt on 29 September 1918.
He was shot dead at close range four days later. He did not stay to enjoy receiving the Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration.
His grandchildren unveiled the memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
Michael Van, one of his grandchildren, said that it is truly symbolic to have the monument erected in his memory 100 years after receiving the Victoria Cross.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van moved his battalion into the Canal de Saint Quentin, where heavy traffic fog and enemy machine guns were screaming for uncontrolled fire".
He later showed great bravery on the battlefield, going to the front of the battle and single-handedly repelling three enemy guns with a field gun.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of World War I.
"I can't repeat what my grandfather did in life", said 72-year-old Michael Van, "but I can be very humble about it".
After the military drill, he laid the foundation stone with his brother Dr. James Van, organized by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
"It is an honour to be here", said Mr. Van, adding that "the hero's bravery has been so warmly supported by many people".
MMA fans who waited all night to see Belator 206 got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you have been up all night watching Belator 206, but you cannot attend the main event.
Bill of San Jose had a total of 13 fights, including six on the main card and was shown live on Channel 5 all night.
At 6am, Gerard Moussac and Rory MacDonald were set to perform, but when the Peppa Pig show was replaced by coverage, UK fans were shocked.
It was only natural that some of the spectators who had waited until morning for this fight were angry.
A fan on Twitter was furious about the children's cartoon show being aired, saying, 'This is a bad joke.'
"The 6:00 a.m. fight show was not appropriate for government broadcasting policy, so they had to air a children's program", said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator.
"Peppa the Pig", yes.
Scott Coker, Chairman, Bellator Company, said that he would be planning the event in the future with the UK audience in mind.
"Perhaps I think we can set the replay time to suit the UK", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning there", he said, "but we can't make it to our Sunday time, their Monday time.
However, we are trying to fix this.
Yes. When we had to stop broadcasting, they were all angry. There was a barrage of messages.
We are working on fixing this, we thought it might be a technical problem.
But this is not the case, they are following the instructions of the government.
I can only assure you that this will not happen next time.
He said that we can bring it up to five fights instead of six fights. We were doing five fights before.
This is an unfortunate situation", he said.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's contempt for sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he feels inferior about his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to do it and what led to his success.
It was not until he was 24 years old and in high school that he realized that everyone was different.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He said that being a parent has made him less concerned about the Olympics.
Kirsty Yang, who regularly took care of the show, took several months off.
Daily, who appeared as a cast member on Laverne's show, said that while she felt inferior, liking boys and girls was not considered normal.
"To this day", he says, "feeling inferior or different has given me the strength to succeed".
They wanted to create an environment where they could achieve something and show off, and no one would feel anything even if they knew about their sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist, she became a high-profile LGBT campaigner, this time urging more countries to decriminalize homosexuality during the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he was happy to be living in freedom and would work to inspire hope in others.
It was a surprise when she began to fall in love with a man in 2013. This man was US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daly married Oscar winner Lance Black, who was 20 years her senior, last year, but felt that the age difference was not a big deal.
"I was very young", he recalls. "When I was 14, I won my first Olympic medal. Three years later, my father died of cancer.
The couple became parents to a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley. This development completely changed the customs of Daly's lifestyle.
"If you asked me last year, I would have talked about winning the gold medal.
"You know, there are bigger things in life than winning Olympic gold.
Robby, my Olympic gold medal".
He named his son Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
According to Daily, his father Robert did not want to die. He always asked if he could get a ticket to sit in the front row at the 2012 London Olympics.
"But how can I tell you that you can't be in the front row", Daily asks.
And I held their breath in my hand, and thought, They shall live until their breath cease; but I perceived that they shall not live for ever.
The following year, Daley won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"My whole life I dreamed of diving for my country in front of spectators at the Olympic Games. There is nothing more exciting than winning a medal".
This was the inspiration for their first song choice, Heather Small's Pride, which resonated with the Olympic preparations and was a thrill.
Desert Island discs are on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Ryder Cup rest for Michelsen on Saturday after losing rhythm
American Phil Michelson was due to play his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he needs to get back in the rhythm if he is to make a milestone.
Michelson, who is participating in the biennial tournament for a record 12th time, was rested by team captain Jim Furyk on Saturday in the Four Balls and Four Sums.
The four-time major winner, who has been a standout performer for the United States as well as a Ryder Cup star, spent the day as a cheerleader and focused on improving his game.
The 48-year-old, who was not known for straight achievements even at the peak of his career, was not a role model for the National Golf Course, which penalizes long, rough, faulty shots.
While the course is not as challenging, Michelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, having won all four of his matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
The Americans, who have started 12 singles matches four points short, will see Michelson's match as a hot start.
Furyk said nothing but expressed confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood what his role was today. He patted my back and said he was ready for tomorrow's match using his arms around me", Furyk said.
"They are very confident in themselves.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past.
I didn't think he would play only two matches.
I thought I could win more, but it happened this way. We thought it was the right decision.
They want to be here like everyone else".
Michelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This marked the end of his Ryder Cup career, which did not match his personal record height.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although his presence has brought some ambiguity to the team, Furyk said.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny. He likes to make fun of people, and he's a good guy on our team", she explained.
The younger players were having fun going to him, and even this week, I think it was fun to watch.
They offer more than just a game.
Thomas Jorn, the leader of Europe, said that the large-scale lead will soon disappear.
European leader Thomas Jorn knows from experience that a key lead in the singles match on the final day of a Ryder Cup tournament can easily turn into an unpleasant ride.
Dan made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had scored five points over the Americans but only got the finish line to their nose at the front by narrow margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2 to win.
After watching the Class of 2018 come out with a 5-3 win on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead in the National League Golf Championship, you'll remember that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but not just", said Jorn.
So history shows that for me and for everyone on the team, this is not over.
Tomorrow everyone will be very bored.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus will stay.
I said everywhere, I'm focused on the 12 players in my squad, but we know very well what's on the other side - the best players in the world".
He said that he was happy to see how his players performed on the tough golf course.
Tomorrow will be different.
The upcoming solo shows tomorrow, and that's another thing to do.
It's good to be with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're out on your own, your ability as a golfer is put to the test.
The message is that you have to reach out to the players, you will get better results from them tomorrow.
Let your companions go for now and they need to go and wish them well".
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk was performing better than his players as a partner, while Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself is at the end of both legs of that last trade, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser as Europe came out "in Medina at Medina".
"When I asked Ben Crane Shaw, who was captain in 1999, how he got his players together for the last day, I remember every bad word of it", he said.
"We have 12 major games tomorrow, but you want to start fast like you saw at the Brook Line, like you saw at Medina.
When it's fast that way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle fights.
We'll set up our line-up accordingly and train the boys in the way we think, you know, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter facing other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this move because I think it's going to be covered in every way", Jorn said of his singles choices.
The German new battleship was delayed again
The German Navy's new fleet was supposed to be deployed in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and snowball costs, local media reported that it would not be possible until next year.
According to the Direct newspaper, citing a military spokesperson, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, the "Rhineland-Pfalz", has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but some post-delivery issues ruined the prospects of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, ordered back by the Navy in 2007, will replace the Bremen-class battleships.
They are known to include powerful artillery, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some secret technologies such as low radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other key features include long maintenance periods, i.e. the possibility of deploying new warships from major local ports for up to two years.
However, due to the constant delays of the state-of-the-art warships - which are said to allow Germany to power projects abroad - they will already be outdated by the time they enter service, says Direkt.
The F125 was reportedly refused to be kept as an official ship of the German Navy last year and was returned to the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This will be the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reason for the withdrawal, but German media cited several critical factors as "software and hardware deficiencies" that would render the warship useless if deployed in combat.
The Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by about 120 Navy sailors, so software deficiencies may be a major factor in part - half the manpower used here compared to the older Bremen-class battleships.
Also, the ship is overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have risen from an initial €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
These difficulties are especially significant in terms of acquiring new warships under recent warnings that the naval power in Germany is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of Germany's parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the navy was in fact "leaving behind deployable-capable ships".
The official said that over time the problem has grown like an iceball as the old vessels were cancelled but replacement vessels were not provided.
He regretted that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigate could rejoin the fleet.
The National Trust's surveillance of the secret lives of bats
New research is underway at the Scottish Highland Estates, aiming to reveal how bats use the land for their hunting for food.
It is believed that research on the behaviour of unique flying mammals will shed new light and guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland followed common and soprano pipistrels, including brown long-eared and dubent bat.
Special recorders are placed at key points of their movements to track the activity of bats in all seasons.
NHS staff and volunteers are also conducting surveys on mobile phones using handheld filters.
From all the recordings, expert voice analysis confirms the frequency of the bats' cries and what species are doing.
A habitat map and report are made to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information helps to determine the benefits of habitat management activities such as grassland creation and better knowledge of how to manage wilderness for bats and other related species.
Bat populations have declined significantly over the past century in Scotland and across the UK.
They are endangered by building and development works, which affect poultry and habitat loss.
Some chemicals can cause damage to fly paper and building materials, as well as wind turbines and lighting can pose a danger to pets.
Bats are not really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to identify errors and obstructions in their flight path.
NTS takes bat care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
It has ten trained specialists who conduct surveys, inspections and sometimes defence on an ongoing basis.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only reserve of bat conservation at the Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to the estate's manager, David Thompson, the estate is the ideal area for them.
"We have a good area for bats in Thrive", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and all the good habitats.
But we don't know much about bats, so we're working here and helping to understand more about what they need to do to thrive in other places".
He stresses the importance of testing bats before conducting site management, as 400 female species and younger generations were wiped out without adequate maternal care, possibly leading to the extinction of entire populations.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their offspring.
Elizabeth Farrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
As he says: "We still have to learn about our bats and many of our generations don't know how their populations are moving".
Ronaldo's rape claim was dismissed as a lawsuit was filed by lawyers against German Mag Jean.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the claim of rape against him "fake news", saying people use his name to "promote themselves".
His lawyer is ready to sue the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorca in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was alleged to have paid $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Speaking in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers just hours after the claims were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo said it was all "fake news".
"No, no, no, no. I was just saying,
He said today that he was a fake news, a five-time Ballon d'Or winner, in front of the camera.
"They will do all this on my behalf, " Jesus said.
It's common.
They're famous for using my name, but that's part of the job.
I am very happy and everything is fine, just another player has joined, he laughed.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel, which they have called "unacceptable reporting on doubts in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Skirtz is seeking compensation for moral damages in the amount "commensurate with the violation, which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada reported that Ronaldo and Mayorca went back to the player's room, where he raped her.
After the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell at my feet and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good man".
Ronaldo confirmed the couple had a sexual relationship, but it was consensual, according to records.
Mayogra went to the police and gave them photos taken of her injuries in the hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she was in shock over the alleged incident and was now trying to cancel the will.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged move and agreed a €100 million deal for Italian giants Juve this summer.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK "will forever regret" losing its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Barnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a no-deal Brexit event on a border delay could cost jobs.
The Bernaston plant, which makes Toyota's Yaris and Avenis, produced around 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain is hit by the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the EU without any deal on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has said it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The carmakers' concerns are that there are risks to supply chain issues in the absence of a deal in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "time-only" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU.
The industry says that if the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border due to delays and spare parts shortages.
Toyota said it was impossible to keep a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, and thus production would be halted.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's Checks Plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need to make a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows us to enjoy the current success, as I say", he told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we must be fully capable of maintaining highly successful supply chains".
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately hurt jobs.
Peter Tsouvaleris, who has worked at Barnaston for 24 years and is a United Union convener at the plant, said his members are more concerned: "In my experience once these jobs are lost, they can't come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
As the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "pushed back another week", the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special counsel investigating contacts between Trump aides and Russia and obstruction of justice by the president, due to Russian election interference.
Washington aired news for months about whether Trump would take on the deputy attorney general and jeopardize Mueller's freedom for it.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he went to the White House last Monday, even as there were speculations that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "would not prefer" shooting Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of sexual abuse, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "There's no date set for it, it could be this week, I could see pushing it back another week given all the other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press updated".
Some reporters contest that proposal: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reason for the lack of press conference was not a lack of interest in attention. Rather, he explained why: "I don't disagree with their point".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press should be increased.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president", he said, without citing evidence, adding: "We've seen such numbers".
Briefings still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press is allowed to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's infinitely more than talking to me".
We try to do a lot of the same thing and you've seen us do a lot of that over the last few weeks and when you talk to the president of the United States, it's going to be in the press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
One-man press conferences are very rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated with perhaps freewheeling and sometimes bizarre-looking reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working on Scotland's NHS to express gratitude for the country and that he wants to be in a post-Brexit position.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter from the UK less than six months before the EU withdrawal.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its enhanced public services.
In her letters, Ms Freeman wrote: "As the summer is over, talks between the UK and the EU on withdrawal are continuing, moving towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government is stepping up its preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That is why I would like to emphasize how much I value the contribution of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare will benefit colleagues across the EU and beyond, as well as the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we would very much like you to stay here".
Kristen Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie was hit in the head and underwent emergency surgery following a 31-27 loss to the Wonderbuilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred before halftime.
"They came to the party, what a mess", Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by coaches and medical staff before he was placed on a stretcher and returned for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Wanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris "has no details yet on the extent of the injury", and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Harris "has no details yet on the type/scale of injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Under the new Tory schemes, foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK with extra money used to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of the drive by Corbin to attract young voters.
Stamp duty increases are charged to non-taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - the extra money being used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide affordable housing to young voters and target higher income earners.
Stamp duty will be increased on individuals and entities who do not pay tax in the UK, the government is moving to charge additional money on those who do not.
Additional charge - This includes higher levels and opportunities to buy in second homes introduced two years ago, in addition to the current stamp duty - may be three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million annually with this move.
Non-UK residents are buying 13% of new properties being built in London, which is driving up prices and making it impossible for first time homeowners to afford their own shelter.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" as large numbers of foreign buyers spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
She accused big construction firms of driving up property prices by taking land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to abolish the quota for affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing disgrace".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and ending "no fault eviction".
He also demanded that councils be given more powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to restoring British love - to make life better for each new generation.
This means that we have to fix our affordable housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be said that buying homes is as easy as it is for hardworking British residents who are not resident in Britain and foreign-based companies.
For many people, homeownership has become a distant dream, and the poor life of sleeping on the streets continues to be a harsh reality".
Jack Ross: 'Managing Scotland is my ultimate ambition'
Jack Rose, the head of Sunderland, said it was his "ultimate ambition" to be Scotland manager at some point in his life.
The 42-year-old Scott, who has eagerly accepted the challenge of reviving the North Eastern club, is currently third in League One, three points down from first place.
He returned to the Stadium of Lights this summer after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and it was like this", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sport Sound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland with my father in Hampden ever since I was a child, and it's always something that binds me.
I will get the opportunity only if I manage the club successfully.
Previously, Rose was managed by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alowa Athletic chief says he had no qualms about joining such a large club in the line-up of established names. He had previously turned down offers from Barnes-Lay and Ipswich Town.
"The only criterion by which this time is measured is how I can take this club back to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that this is a Premier League club.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I feel I've succeeded here if I can get the club back there".
Rose has had a management career of just three years. He has served as assistant head coach at Dumbarton and on the coaching staff of Hearts for 15 months.
He then helped recover Alloa, who had slipped to third place. By the following season, he had transformed St Mirren from relegation to Championship title winner.
Rose says that she now feels more comfortable than she ever did before at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a really confusing time", he recalled of his time in Aloha.
"I honestly believed that management was better for me than playing.
It's weird because I've done it right, I've earned enough, I've reached a lot of heights.
But playing is really hard.
There are many things you have to do once a week.
I cannot escape it in terms of work pressures and stress, it will continue.
I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it. I feel that this is the most comfortable thing I can do in my entire adult life".

The best time to drink a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., says the survey
The summer heat wave has boosted sales of Britain's struggling pubs, but at the same time, has added pressure on the restaurant chain.
Sales of pubs and bars rose 2.7 percent in July - but sales at restaurants fell 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the data, said: "Due to the continued sun and England's longer than expected attendance at the World Cup, pubs were up 2.8 per cent in July on the previous June pattern, but restaurants faced even more difficult days.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant turnover in June was further intensified in July.
Pubs and bars, which are primarily beverage-sales, have performed better than restaurants in terms of business.
Even at festivals where food is the main dish, the sun's heat has affected the restaurant owner less severely.
It seems that people want to go out to drink.
Sales of alcohol in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent month on month, while food sales decreased by three per cent".
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analyst firm `RSM's says: "These results are part of a continuation of the trend we have seen since late April.
When it comes to sales in the open or outdoor market, the influence of weather and major social or sporting events remains the biggest determining factor.
It is not surprising that restaurant conglomerates continue to struggle, because, while sales are falling by 4.8 percent year on year, on the other hand, operating costs are rising.
The long summer should not have come on days when food-centric restaurants are struggling. Time will tell if the moderate temperatures we experienced in August provide the much-needed relief".
Total sales growth of all pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened in July, was 2.7 percent, reflecting slowing product launches by brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 management teams with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, is now an established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that their parents do not know about
The survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - is secretly creating social media accounts without adults knowing.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had maintained a "main" account, which was "pure" and "clean" and had private accounts.
According to a mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret location, the teenager had been urging her on social media to "rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headteachers and Headmistresses Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
"It is alarming that so many teens are being lured into creating online places that parents and teachers cannot find", says Mike Buchanan, head of HMC.
Eliud Doyle is the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eliud Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Body's Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most popular track and field athlete. Appreciating the selection process, President Ian Beatty described it as a great opportunity to leverage the vast experience of Elid at the international level over the past decade to guide the sport.
"Elid is held in great esteem by the whole athletics community in Scotland, UK and the world. I am confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely by bringing him on board", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I am excited to serve as a voice for athletes and feel I can really contribute towards guiding sport in Scotland".
The American, who won four gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, is now a regular on the BBC, but has been unable to walk since suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke on this day a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I made a full recovery. I learned how to walk again. Today I do agility exercises.
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Pro-opposition to a breast pump advertisement that compares mothers to sisters
Both have expressed opposition online to a breast pump company's ad comparing mothers to their mothers.
Consumer tech company LV has launched the world's first silent wearable breast pump. It also released a music video that shows how the new pump gives mothers a way to express themselves.
The special feature of this video is four mothers dancing in a hay shed: Yes, my milk is calling, "But you can't see any tail. If you think these are her scratches, you're wrong. These are my breasts".
The lyrics go like this: "Pump, pump, I'll give the children milk... pump, pump, pump, call the women milk".
The advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has caused a lot of controversy online.
The video has already been viewed by 77,000 people and has hundreds of comments. Viewers have had mixed reactions, saying it makes fun of the "terrible" dairy industry.
"It's a poor decision to use her for this breast pump commercial.
And again, "Their daughters are pregnant and giving birth to babies. Their calves are being carried away like calves".
The LV breast pump is concealed inside the bra of the nursing mother (LV/mother)
Another commented: "I know it's hard for both mother and child.
But why not use this breast pump for baby-sitters?"
Another said: "A headless advertisement".
Inaro defended the ad. One woman commented that the song was actually "funny".
"This is a common idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one of these.
It is true that you may feel faint during pumping.
Advertising may seem a little crazy, but it's also a little true.
Inaro wrote that this is a genius product.
Another commented: "It's a joke on mothers who get the feeling that they're actually a bitch by pumping (in workplaces and toilets)".
This is not an advertisement to praise or flatter the dairy industry".
Finally, the dancing women in the ad show themselves wearing a breast pump inside their bra.
The principle behind the campaign is the insight that many mothers who use a breast pump think they are a bitch.
The LV pump, however, works completely quietly, has no nozzles or tubes, fits comfortably inside a breast-feeding bra, gives women freedom of movement, picks up babies, and can even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balerin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product that needed a bold and provocative start.
We wanted to talk about breast pumping and its challenges by demonstrating equality between women expressing and dairy cows, and how the new pump can make you feel independent by telling it in an entertaining and relevant way.
This is not the first time that LV pump has been in the headlines.

Hundreds of children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The Trump administration's strict administrative measures have made it difficult to provide parents for refugee children, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of children detained at border crossings in the month, despite the same number of detentions.
Traditionally, those who want to raise such children are themselves refugees, and their lives are insecure, and the desire to raise such children makes their existence in the country more insecure.
The risk increased further in June, when federal authorities made it mandatory for individuals or families who wish to raise children to provide fingerprints, so that such fingerprints can be provided to immigration officials later.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albens testified before Congress that his agency and dozens of others had been arrested for attempting to care for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested in this way had no criminal background.
"80% of the individuals are either sponsors or family members of the sponsors who are here illegally, most of whom have criminal records.
So we are trying to catch these individuals", Albenz said.
To speed up the process of resolving the children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring that they appear before the court within a month of their arrest, up from 60 days earlier.
Most of them do not have to appear in person but instead appear via video call to present their legal status and are heard by an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for exemption will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are in custody, the more they become anxious and depressed, leading to violent emotions and a tendency to escape. Shelter workers have also reported that this has happened.
Advocates say that such facilities are more likely to be large, and that the number of children in need is too large to care for.
The workers feel that moving the children to the tent city without giving them any time to prepare emotionally and finally to say goodbye to their friends will only add to their pain.
Syria says US, French and Turkish troops have withdrawn
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'lem has called for the return of Syrian refugees as the war enters its eighth year.
Mauleem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally based on Syrian soil and fighting terrorism is only a pretext for them and warned against taking action against these forces.
"They should come out immediately and unconditionally", he said.
According to Mauleem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where 360,000 people have been killed and millions more have fled their homes since 2011.
He said that the Syrian army will continue its fight against terrorism and illegal foreign troops until Damascus is taken over by the Syrian army.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training Kurdish and other Arab forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French soldiers are stationed in the war-torn country.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Mauleem said that now is the time for all of them to return home. He said that some Western countries are creating unnecessary fear and preventing refugees from returning home.
"We call on the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate such returns", he said.
"In fact, they are also making politics on issues that are of concern to humanity".
The United States and the European Union have warned against any help in Syria's reconstruction unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN ambassadors expressed hope that the talks on the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels between Russia and Turkey, would create the right environment for the start of political talks.
The pact between Russia and Turkey avoided the possibility of an attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the state, which is home to millions of people.
The agreement has a "clear deadline" and the Syrian offensive will be against all jihadist groups, including the al-Qaeda-backed Nusra Front, and will be aimed at their complete destruction, Maulom said.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura is optimistic about the formation of a new committee, made up of members of the government and the opposition, which aims to draft a post-war constitution in Syria and pave the way for elections.
The Syrian government's participation in the committee was subject to conditions, and the purpose of the Constitutional Committee should be limited to review the provisions of the current constitution.
Trump will be president again, how?
It is not a good idea for Trump to lose the presidency through a series of scandals or promises. This logic is that Trump will be the president of the United States again in 2020.
So this will be the most dramatic presidential election fight ever!"
There is no reason for viewers to be upset about this.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's has tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers, according to Nielsen, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" received 3.5 million viewers and became the top show.
"It's a monster that attracts people. We don't understand what it is", says Neil Baer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor".
But that is not the case with Nell Scovel, a senior humorist and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club.
He recalled the cab raid before the 2016 Boston election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why? "Neil asks.
He said, "They laugh at me", "Mrs. Scovel told me.
There is a fun part to this chaos.
Of course, more than anything else on TV, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Rowe, whether immigrant families can reunite, or whether the global economy can recover.
Change is a luxury that can only be achieved by the most privileged.
Yet watching experts discuss on TV Paul Manafort's $15,000 oyster leather jacket (Washington Post called it Garment Thick with Hubris)... watching the impact of the Storminian Dales' description of Trump - that's not enough information for us.
I can't even see Super Mario the same way.
According to Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment, author of 'Pavn Stars,' it feels like there's a reality show every night. Trump is feeding into the debates, whether it's a conflict with the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un.
He feels that if you miss one episode, you are far behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Flea's this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was taken inside to watch MSNBC while CNN was recording.
They can't face themselves, so Brett Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court's future can be balanced against facing the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"I remember we were doing all those amazing shows and people were telling me, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but then I felt like they were doing the right thing".

Tight midterm election house races are a waste of money
It's no surprise to see Pennsylvania's 17th cash flow, thanks to a reorganization of congressional districts that dropped two contenders for a single seat.
This recently re-created suburban Pittsburgh district pits Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb - who last won his seat in another district in a special election.
Lamb is currently running against another seat, Republican Keith Roth Fuss, who represents the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were recreated after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered on behalf of the Republicans.
The new 17th contest touches on the campaign finance slugfest between the major party financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania after being widely watched in a special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The Republican had contested that seat for a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats some gravitas.
USL San Salvador fined for supporting China, then backed
The diplomats noted that Beijing in Washington had already identified with the Dominican Republic and Panama.
Mr. Trump held an intimate meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
"State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama regarding further decisions to recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine was only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and proposed visa restrictions, will hurt the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, officials in North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year, a step in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But by mid-September, he made clear that the conference of top executive officials should continue, effectively ending any consideration of a fine to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence now addresses a conference scheduled for mid-October, diplomats said, as a sign of the importation of administration sites.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the discussion, three US officials, including two diplomats, explained, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
His accounts were confirmed by outside analysts close to the administration and spoke on condition of anonymity.
History of the study
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's obstruction of justice may be the next target, of which there is now ample evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly changed his investigation to see if the Trump campaign has colluded with Russia in the attack on our election.
As Mr. Trump prepares to go before voters again, Congress needs to change hands and ultimately his peers' verdict is final.
That was a lot of things, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable or that there is no equivalent in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices to make that will affect how long the fight can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, with only the Westerners opposing them and supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next massacre.
The course of history revolves around such reflection points and the inevitability of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these conspiracy elements.
What should we do if Mr. Trump takes on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Last year, Rosenstein has been in the limelight since the paper reported that he had asked the president to record in secret and determined he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account is incorrect.
"How do we respond to the newly requested F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh's investigation was not complete or legitimate or confirmed him to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?"
And above all, will we vote in the interim for Congress to hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in such tests, democracy will be in chaos for a long time.
But I think the lesson I learned in Prague is that we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had occupied my embassy.
She survived, then immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that desk with the swastika.
Like my heritage, can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Before the Rapid Vienna Clash, Rangers Graham Dorrance was an optimist
Rangers' win over hosts Rapid Vienna, the Austrians, on Thursday puts them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League, after an impressive performance against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from tying Villarreal 2-2 for the first time but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for more.
"It's a joy for us because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and got away with it.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but overall, a draw is probably a fair result.
They probably played well in the first half and we came out in the second half and were a better team.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it was a tough game and they had a good result in their last match but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can go on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with my injuries and everything that happened with the changes at the club now having an emotional element about the place.
The team is great and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is great.
Hopefully, we can now move forward, we may have beaten us last season and now we have a chance".
Women are losing sleep for fear of savings during this retirement
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of themselves, few people talked about it with their family members.
He said that half of the individuals in the nationwide study were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they have talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them but they're not taking steps to engage in the dialogue", said Holly Cinder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not give your congratulations ahead of time, your family will not be prepared.
Talk with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as such options can play a major role in determining cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you by suggesting ways to pay for such expenses.
Your provident fund options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy, to help you save on these expenses as long as you have the money, or to help you self-insure your property.
Get your legal documents out: Face legal battles at the pass.
Get a healthcare proxy to find out about your medical care so you can assign a trusted person and make sure that your professional follows up if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.
If you cannot afford to make financial decisions and pay your bills, you can choose a trusted person.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your aging parent needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
You can prepare by giving these details in writing.
"It's not just a game of money", Martin asks, "but who are the doctors?"
"What are medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put that one idea into practice".
In Lifracombe, a man shot several times with an air rifle
A man was shot several times by an air rifle while walking home at night.
The victim was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Livercombe, Devon when he was shot, and was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Officials describe the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the man who attacked him.
His injuries were not life threatening and police have called for witnesses.
The earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
Due to the damage to communications, relief officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongola Regency in the northern zone of Palu, the area near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu since the disaster.
Some highlights of the island of Palu and Dongola in Sulawesi are:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a steep bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
The regency, called Dongola, extends for more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwest part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, the administrative region at the bottom of the region, was estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic backbone of Central Sulawesi is fishing and agriculture, which is the main occupation, especially in the coastal area of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important in the area, but it is mostly specialized in Morowali, a coastal area opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Relief and Relief Agency, the last 100 years have seen multiple tsunami attacks in Palu and Dongola.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in Dongola due to a tsunami and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami caused nine deaths in western Dongola in 1996.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an earthquake zone, so it is always affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of North Sumatra in the Aceh region of Indonesia on Dec. 26 hit 14 nations, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coastal region, more than half of whom occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, killing about 700 people in a tsunami that hit the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits the Mentawai Islands of Sumatra, creating waves 10 meters high, destroying dozens of Gattale villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: As people remember from the devastation of the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami, an earthquake once again hit the PD Jaya Regency, causing devastation and panic.
No tsunami this time was a nuisance, but over 100 people have died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, mostly in the northern part of the island, killing more than 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily disrupted thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, have been arrested on assault charges.
A man named Pauline 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when the woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away from her.
Palin is being remanded to the Mat-Su pretrial facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "definitely, not guilty" when his appeal was heard, the network reported.
Pauline faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This was not the first time that Pauline had faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Paley, was charged with assault.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and being a drug addict in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior led to PTSD arising from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
384 people have been killed in the earthquake that struck Sulawesi, Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communication network has been cut off with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake struck in Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Influencer videos are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu city, when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspect in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York have sentenced Saifullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, to death - a rare sentence not carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Sipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental truck to raid a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent seeking the death penalty, filed in the New South District.
According to court records, both counts carry the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of robbers, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and proactive preparation", with prosecutors describing the approach taken in Saipov as "cruel, brutal and fraudulent".
"Sifulo Habillavich Saipov inflicted injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelín, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decadut, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, and to the families and friends of the victims of the shooting".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last tried a death penalty case.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a New York federal case was executed was in 1953 when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed two years earlier after plotting to run a church for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair.
A resident of Saipav, Uzbekistan, showed a lack of compassion in days and months, according to court records.
He said he had a good feeling about what he did, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipav told the authorities that he was inspired after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He also pleaded not guilty to the charge number 22.
According to David Patton, one of the representatives of the Federal Public Defender representing SaiPav, he is "clearly disappointed" with the decision of the lawsuit.
"The death penalty instead of life in prison without the possibility of parole would drag on for a long time for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipav's detention team had earlier asked the judge not to impose the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit
During a protest at the Tory Conference today, he vowed to Nigel Farage to 'mobilising the people's army'.
Theresa May's MP - who said she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU - said politicians should 'feel the heat' from Eurosceptics, according to former UK leaders.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have already left if Farage had not been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Ms May faces is different, she stressed, with the separate struggle being waged by those who want to stay in the city amid the ongoing anti-Brexit movement.
The Prime Minister is struggling to track down his Chequers compromise plan amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and Europeans.
The Allies insisted that she move forward with an agreement with Brussels despite heavy opposition - and urged Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bonn said he wanted to do 'Chuck Checkers' at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull.
He suggested that Faraz should be made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If they had taken charge, we would have left already,' he said.
Wellingborough MP said: 'I stand for Brexit but we need to check the checks.'
He expressed his opposition to the European Union, saying: 'We did not fight happily in the world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our country. '
Bonn dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay without Brexit is completely false.'
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, telling reporters: 'I have a little advice: Prime Ministers, listen to the people.
'Checkers are not popular in the public sphere, the opposition does not vote for them, it is not popular even in our party and our worker circle, really these activists fight in the streets and choose us first.
Please drop the checkers and start asking.'
In a message to Mrs May, he said: 'When Prime Ministers keep their promises, they keep their position.'
Farage said that if the politicians running the rally were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should be 'hot-wired'.
"It is now a matter of trust between our people and our political class", he said.
'We are here today to make it clear that they are trying to betray Brexit and we will not let them do that.'
Addressing the cheering crowd, he said: "I want you to warm up our political class who betrayed Brexit.
'We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us victory over Brexit and will never rest until we make our country a proud independent, self-governing United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Activists blew Tories against Brexit banners after the group started this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked Conservatives on the party app about the security problems they experienced as the conference opened.
"These people will tell us that they can have IT systems with Canada etc etc and have all the technology with Ireland, such as a no-conflict border and open border for free trade etc", he said.
'This is a complete travesty.
There is no better thing than Brexit", he said.
Warren plans to make 'hard decision' to run for US president
"I will make a tough decision to run for president", said Senator Elizabeth Warren after the U.S. election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future moves at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Jeff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is the focal point of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting Trump held with the units using the town hall format since taking office.
People attending the meeting asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in high office", Warren replied.
The LSU team's Sims murder - the killer arrested
Police in La Baton Rouge announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of a man named Dayton Simpson 20 at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
He had released a video of the shooting of the murder on Friday, asking for help identifying the man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wade Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and was ultimately pronounced dead", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, 247 Sports reported.
Wade had come forward to save his friend and shot Simpson.
Simpson was questioned about this and admitted that he was the one in the scene with the weapon and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Raised in Baton Rouge, the 6-foot-6-inch Sims played in 32 games, including 10 starts, last season and averaged 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes the World Championship round after a win against Sebastian Vettel after team order
It was clear from the moment of qualifying that Mercedes team orders would play a bigger role in the race than that of Valtteri Bottas over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday.
From the pole, Bottas got off to a good start and defended his position in the first two turns, nearly preventing Hamilton from scoring any points, thus inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pits first and let Hamilton drive in traffic behind the group, which was crucial.
Mercedes then pitched a lap and Vettel came out behind, but Hamilton went ahead with some wheel-to-wheel action that allowed the Ferrari driver to pass unwillingly from the inside after a double move to safeguard the third corner freely, thus putting him in danger of being ejected.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He led for the majority of the race as he held on to his tyres to finish the race quickly and push Kimi Räikkönen into fourth place.
He finally got to the pit on lap 44 but could not pick up speed for the remaining eight laps as Ryukonen was fourth.
It was a difficult day because Voltaire did all the work brilliantly over the weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a two-out", Hamilton said.
It's really bad sign language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feynes-Tayne at a rally on Saturday for insisting that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had not leaked a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford accusing her of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president responded that Ford did not directly address the evidence he gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead showed people what was happening in the Senate as "selfish and disgusting and false".
"One of the things that has been happening in the Senate for the last few days and the beautiful thing is what it feels like when you see anger, when you see angry and mean and disgusting and lying people", he said.
"You see the release and the leak and then they're like, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it".
Do You Recall?
Diane Feynman, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I was just...
I did not leak".
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't", he added, adding the impression of a senator.
A letter explaining the allegations against Kavanagh was sent to Feynman in July by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feynman denied that the leak came from his office.
"I'm not making accusations against Dr. Ford, I'm not leaking her story", Feynes told the Ten Committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as she asked".
But his refusal does not seem to have caught up with the president, who responded at a rally on Saturday night: "What I'm saying, that's really bad sign language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst sign language I've ever seen".
Defending the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually assaulting three women, the president accused the Democrats of using the allegations for their own purposes.
"He has decided to withdraw power by any means necessary.
You see the selfishness, the ugliness in them, who they hurt, who they don't even care who they drive to gain power and control", the president said, Mediate reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win against Bell Fast Giants by 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars won the return match in Dundee on Saturday by 5-3 to avenge their Elite League defeat against the Bell Fast Giants.
The Giants took an opening two-goal lead with striking strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulieu.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney helped their team to even the lead of the Dwyer Giants.
Two Lucas Lundwald Nielsen goals were equalised by François Bouchard Dundee before the victory was secured.
This was Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat of the season after coming from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in a game at Bell Fast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the opening goal with the help of Kendall McFall at 3:35 of the fourth minute, before Bouvillier doubled the lead when David Rutherfurd provided an assist four minutes later.
Sullivan brought his team into the fight at 13:10 in a tight opening period. Cooney then tied the score at 15:16 with Matt McVard.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead to the first half by scoring the second goal of the night late in the first period.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard added another point with a power play goal in 27:37.
Together, Cooney and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and secured the win in the final period, halfway through their team's fifth period.
Now having lost four of their last five games, the Giants will face Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies while trying to save hundreds of people on a plane from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now being hailed as a hero for sacrificing his life to help hundreds of passengers get off the ground safely.
More than 800 people died and nearly a dozen are missing after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The city of Palu is in a state of chaos and most of the people are still trapped under the rubble.
While all his colleagues fled in fear, 21-year-old Antoine Guenavan Agung, who was reeling from the earthquake, did not leave the control tower at Sisi al-Jufri Airport, Muthiar's main airport.
He was still in the tower to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was flying up the runway at that moment, would take off safely.
He jumped out of the tower, thinking it was going to fall.
And he died in Asphad.
"His decision saved the lives of hundreds", said Johannes Sirit, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, as reported by ABC News of Australia.
We brought him by helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, and arranged to transfer him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him earlier today before the helicopter reached the port.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this news", he said.
Meanwhile, access to the towns of Dongola, Sighi and Baotong is limited, the country's disaster management agency said, with officials expressing concern that the death toll could reach thousands.
"Many bodies are still in the rubble, but the number is believed to be at risk of increasing as many are not reachable", said agency spokesman Suutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves of up to six meters have devastated the portion and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing relief and relief supplies.
"Ambulances are bringing bodies every minute", said Reza Kusuma, 35, who told Sky News.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini markets are being looted everywhere".
The head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, John Gelfund, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross rescue workers are rushing to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already proven to be a disaster, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at the base on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to the construction.
Are you ready?" he said, CNN reports.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea says one person is missing after Laguna plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean encircled area of Micronesia has now officially said one person is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
As of Saturday afternoon, it was not possible to count the male passengers, Air New Guinea said in a statement.
The airline said it was trying to locate the man with the help of local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger's age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Seven people were admitted to hospital, officials said on Friday.
Six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them are in stable condition, the airline said.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and what happened.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon area just behind the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jans said the plane had come too low.
"It's very good", said Janes.
Janes said he and others managed to run through waist-level water to find an emergency exit in the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were scared and screaming, which caused a minor head injury.
The Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the wharf also rushed to the rescue, using an inflatable boat to push people ashore before the U.S. aircraft sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The figures from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in a PNG registered airline crash in the last two decades but Air New Guinea is not named in any crash.
An analyst tells the time of night when the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors who tried a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 on Saturday reserved his argument.
Forensic analyst Paul Roulett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of U.S. intelligence analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used cell phone records to record the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers (the victim) on the night of Jessica's death.
Roulett claimed that he had received location data from several cell phones, which showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of the murder, which contradicts what he had said, The Clarion Ledger reported.
The accused claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, but the data shows that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time, when police went to question Sanford.
Sanford came to testify on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors heard Tellis say he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford lied because my truck was in Nashville that night".
Another irony is that Tellis Chambers said that I had only met him about two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records suggest they only met a week ago.
After Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone, Roulett said.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense has decided to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The trial is expected to go to the jury after that day, the judge said.

Another black man?!
A New York nurse sued a couple who texted about "racial"
A New York nurse received a message that she mistakenly received from a woman who claimed it was a discriminatory message.
The couple have denied the accusation that they are racist and likened the lawsuit to "bribery".
When new baby-sitting dad Giselle Morris arrived at her first day of work in 2016, two mothers, Lindsay Plasco-Flexman, were upset to learn she was black.
"No, another black man", Mrs. Plasko-Fluxman texted her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Morris.
After realizing her embarrassing mistake, Placebo-Flex fired "shame-stricken" Man Morris, accusing the nurse, who was African-American, of doing a bad job and sending her home, and that she was expecting a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Morris was paid for a day's work and then sent home at Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for racially harassing messages and even seeking compensation of $350 a day for six months, without a contract, as she was a live-in gigger initially hired to work.
"I want to show it, look, you don't do that kind of thing", he told the Post on Friday, "I know it's racial discrimination".
By saying that it was a reasonable thing to fire Morris, the couple adhered to the statement that she was a racist, accusing her of being untrustworthy after being insulted.
"My wife sent me a text message that I couldn't tell her.
She's not a racist.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post that we are not racists.
"But would you entrust your children to the care of a woman who would behave rudely?
What about your newborn baby?
Please tell me".
Describing the case as a case of "selling out", Plasco said his wife was only two months away from giving birth and "she is in a very difficult situation".
"Do you trust such people and follow them?
It is not such a good thing", said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing in court, the court of public opinion is at the forefront of condemning the couple on social media, with the number of those blaming them for their behavior and logic increasing by the minute.
The publisher of Paddington feared that the idea of a talking bear would be difficult to accept, a new letter says.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was released, wrote in her letter: "It is very difficult to play each other, I read this book for the first time before it was printed.
It is truly amazing to think now what is the secret behind Paddington's tremendous success".
She said that before she wrote the children's book, she had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, inspired by a bear toy. She kept her faith in her work even though her book was rejected.
Apart from Paddington, she says Paddington is also "like an honorary member of our household", as she talks about its amazing success.
She also said: "He was the most quiet person I ever met. He never boasted about his accomplishments".
"But Paddington was a real person to him. It was like, if you had a child who was a successful person in front of you, like: You're not proud of what you didn't do, the same way.
I think that's how he saw the success of Paddington.
Even though it was his creation and his idea, he would give all credit to the padding ton himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
As soon as she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors' efforts to save her life were unsuccessful.
"Nad was calling repeatedly. She didn't expect to get the call, to say it was really serious", said Mrs. Ednan-Lapperhouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I will join you soon, I said.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to pump her heart slowly ran out of steam and she abandoned her body.
She had died a short time ago and the body was neutralizing.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all predetermined.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because of the situation surrounded by my family members and others.
I really had to hold it together".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Lapperhouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - forgetting the ordeal she was experiencing.
"No one knows", she replied.
"I bowed my head, and I cried all the way through the journey.
It's hard to explain, but it expressed this indescribable sympathy for Nad when he was in flight.
He needs my guidance and love.
I know how much he loved her".
Posters of a grieving woman on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Two women, Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys, are posting inspiring messages on Welsh Bridge, as well as giving a phone number for anyone who needs help or comfort to call.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, began to suffer from depression when he was 13 years old.
"I request that no parent should feel the pain I feel every day", she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, of Lidney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious sense of humor.
"Everyone was captivated by his smile.
His smile would brighten any room".
But before he died, he had abandoned his work, thus "going into the dark places".
In 2014, Tyler's older brother, then only 11 years old, was the brother he found after he had given his life.
"I was always worried that something bad would happen", says David.
Mrs. David created the cards because, "No matter how sad you are, you have people to talk to, share your pain with, and you have a friend.
Don't sit alone and be silent - you must speak now".
Mrs. Humphries, Davis' girlfriend for several years, his partner of 15 years, has lost Mark, following the death of his mother.
"She never told me that she was depressed or sad", she says.
"We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Chris Moss.
He was in Rome at Christmas - when the children opened their Christmas gift boxes, he didn't even look at them".
She said that her loss was a shock, but she tried to cope: "It was a big blow to her family.
It made us different.
But we accepted it and fought".
If you are experiencing any sorrow or depression, please call 116 123 (UK and Ireland) or email jo@samaritans.org.
The FBI continues the investigation, so Brett Kavanaugh's future is on hold.
"In my opinion, we get a little bit of what he's asking for - investigation time, scope is very limited. We can bring some unity", Mr. Flake said.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican friends want an FBI investigation?
Their hesitation is due to the present time.
The midterm elections are scheduled for November 6, which is only five weeks away - and as expected, Republicans will not get the result right. They will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the person they want to the world's highest court.
George W. Bush called to call the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom we met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The Senate currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
I still don't understand. Mr. Cavanaugh must get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, so who allowed Mike Pence, the vice president, to end the tie and tell the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors under Kim's administration is 'low'
A South Korean lawmaker says that since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, the number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has declined.
Park Byung-seog, South Korea's unification minister, also provided additional figures. He said that the number of defectors in 2011 was 2,706, up from 1,127 the previous year.
Park said this was due to the tight border zone between North Korea and China and the double the fees charged for human trafficking.
Pang Yong has not made any official statement on the matter.
Most of the people who have fled North Korea have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that some 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the 1953 Korean War.
Most people have fled the country through the Chinese border, which shares a long border with their country, rather than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats those who have escaped as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and in most cases they are extradited back to North Korea.
North and South Korea are still technically at war, but relations between the two have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks on nuclear disarmament.
The development follows a historic meeting in Singapore in June between Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump, during which the two discussed how to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho condemned the US contribution to development.
"Without the trust of the United States, we cannot move forward with the unilateral disarmament of our national security", Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "insane" and thus unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and took the view that he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but notice that when a woman ever behaves like that, they call her 'crazy,'" Pelosi said Thursday, responding to Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the allegation that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
He denied the allegation that the abuse took place when Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford were both teenagers.
He explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against them "a vicious and organized character assassination" staged by liberals. He expressed outrage that this was why Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her belief that Cavanaugh's testimony had proved the view that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it highlighted that he was biased against Democrats, her view.
"Because of those statements and his statements about Clinton and the Democrats, I think he's disqualifying himself", he said.
Pelosi was disappointed when asked if she would seek impeachment if Kavanaugh was confirmed and Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, they're not only not going to be able to appear in the Supreme Court, they're not going to be able to be in court right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said she was concerned about the Affordable Care Act as a Democrat or the rulings of Cavanaugh against Roy V. Wade because, according to her, Cavanaugh is a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions on whether he would revoke some of the judgments given in the Supreme Courts.
"This is not the time for a maniac and a biased person to go to court and say, 'That's not awesome,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It was the word of a righteous person's anger, and even after months and years that anger comes out, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", 45-year-old Steinem told me later.
"I don't think this is unusual, do you?"
She continued, "One female officer helped me a lot, she also said that she would cry when she was angry, but she developed a technique that means that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "I'm crying because you might think I'm sad,
I am angry".
Then she continued.
And I thought it was amazing".
Tears have been seen as a way to vent anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my earliest memories of working in a male-dominated office is that I once cried in unexplainable anger when an elderly woman grabbed my collar and pulled it.
"Don't let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know if you're angry.
They know you are sad and they can rejoice in your sadness".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when she was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called the Hart Monkey Business and walked away from this embarrassment, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, thus finding that she had no reason to withdraw from the presidential race.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said with a smile after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
She had been behind in raising funds. She had promised to raise $2 million. She had even said that if she did not, she would withdraw from the contest.
It was a losing battle.
She learned that some of her supporters had given $1,000 to men and had given her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she spoke to announce that she would not start a campaign, she was overcome with emotions - thanking the people who supported her, raising money and reaching her goal would be very difficult. She expressed frustration with the system. Representatives are voters, and anger over sexism - choked her.
"You might think I had a breakdown from nervous weakness", Ms. Schroeder recalled, describing how the journalism responded to her.
"You thought Clenx was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what they might write on my grave?
"She is a witch"?""
How the U.S.-China trade war has done good for Beijing
The trade war between the US and China is not sounding today, and experts have expressed the opinion that a rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, even if the war is far away.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important development is that tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods will be affected this week, effectively putting half of the tariffs on all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has also retaliated each time, most recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to join the US in the fight, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to shrink much anytime soon.
To push back on Washington means to be a target for demands, but to bow to America in public is very embarrassing to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Yet, experts say if Beijing can play its game right, the pressure of the US trade war will support China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"Experts believe that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would cripple the economies of both countries, which is more dangerous than previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank that monitors Asia affairs.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, foreign minister says
The government, committed to rebuilding the country after seven years of prolonged war, has asked the refugees to come back voluntarily and help.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mawelem said that the situation in the country is now improving.
"Today, the situation is very stable and secure, and I thank you for the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The Government will continue to work to bring back to normalcy the areas devastated by terrorism.
Now is the time for people who have left the country to risk their lives and livestock due to terrorism and one-sided economic policies to return voluntarily.
According to the United Nations, an estimated 5.5 million people fled Syria in 2011.
There are six million people living in this country who will need our humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moallem said the Syrian government welcomes those who help rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not accept help from countries that helped his country's coup or provided conditional aid.
The European team that won the Paris-Ryder Cup
At the 2018 Ryder Cup, Team Europe defeated Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 in the final at Le Golf National, on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Danish-born captain Thomas Jørn's team regained the European crown as they reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the USA team.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled without form for much of the tournament, submerged his tee-shot at the par-3 16th hole, which he lost the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds, becoming one of only 1 in 4 players to achieve 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
Jordan Speith of the United States was eliminated in the 5th and 4th rounds after losing to Denmark's Thorb Jørn Olesen, the lowest ranked player on the European team.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson, who played perhaps his final Ryder Cup, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia is the all-time winner of the European Tour with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry but today I couldn't stop myself.
It's been a kind of tough year.
Thank you Thomas for trusting me.
I am very happy, very happy to win the Cup again.
"I am happy, I am happy to have contributed to the team's victory", said Garcia, who was emotional about winning the European Cup.
He handed the puck to fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Wood 2-1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm really incredibly proud. I can't believe I beat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It's really strange that Tiger Woods, who has won the most major titles since Jack Nicklaus, has 14 titles.
The American team was highly criticized this weekend, but only Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau played their best game of the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk, speaking after his team's disappointing performance, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought well.
We gave the Europe team a little heat this morning.
But we ruined it.
Thomas has a hatsafe.
He's a wonderful captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 players and proud to serve as their captain.
I greet you.
We played well".
