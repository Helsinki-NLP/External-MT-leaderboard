I'm not sure what to do.
Don't get in the way of my work.
Is there anything else to say?

I don't know where they are.
I don't know who won.
I don't need anything.
I don't speak Japanese
I don't trust him.

I know you're gonna tell me no.
I'll be very careful
I'll leave this time.
I'll start this soon.
I'll get off at the next stop.
I'm hungry again.
I am learning Burmese.
I'm not allowed to do that here.
I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
I'm really sorry about last night.

It's not my fault.
I made a mistake, even if I didn't want to.
I have never been to Japan.
I got it.
If I were you, I wouldn't go there today.

My father falls asleep looking at a mirror
My head hurts

The elderly walk slowly
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

Ram came to the bath.
It's the evening reading.

She was breathing cold air.
The younger ones are not born.
The Bible says that "they will not be ashamed of themselves".
She was sitting at the table.
The cat was frightened by the fog .
She's not a doctor.
He's not home anymore.
She has been teaching music for thirty years
He's on his way to school.
She was terrified.
Show me where the pain is.

This sock is not washed.

It's not a sentence.
I was so hurt.
This plant has some burnt leaves.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Tom was washing his hands with fever.
Tom washed his pair of glasses with hot soap water and put them on the skin.
Tom was very scared.
Is it really that bad?
It is better to leave yourself alone
We made it happen.
We don't understand French.
We haven't slept in days.
Shabash, you put this toy right!
We need money to do whatever we want.
We should hire trustworthy ones
We played basketball yesterday.
We must get rid of ourselves
We want to hear
What are you doing tomorrow, Tom?
What are you saying?
What were you talking about?
What were you talking about?
What else would I miss?
What does it mean to play without a license?
How much is the book worth?
What time is it now?

What time is it now?
How much room do you have?
How long has it been?
What are you getting?

Where did you put my book?
Where is Mary?
Where's your boy?
Where words cannot speak, there music speaks.
Which color do you like , blue or purple ?
What's your pen?
Who are we ?
Why didn't you get ready?
Why haven't you slept yet?
Why can't giraffes sing?
Why did you call me?
Why did you lie to her?
She opened the door with her heart beating
Wrong
You can do it
- Is that right?
You're a little fat.
You can eat in this room.
You need not be ashamed.
You have to come once.
You can go swimming or fishing.
You must speak up
Stay where you are.
You seem so happy.
You're coming so soon.
