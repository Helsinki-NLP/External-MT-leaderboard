Tom was poor, although he could have been rich.
Come right now.
Can you find it?
Perhaps the musician Jean-Louis Aubert was right when he said: "If you have passion in your heart, you will be able to enjoy happiness". So, a rich man, no matter what happens, will find it never easy; he will have to take a little bit of trouble. This is what is called a fool.
Are you sick?

We are rich.
I'm not Tom's mother.

As another friend has pointed out, translation is not about taking the place of a language with others. It is about elevating it to a higher level of knowledge, to increase its prestige, to increase its success. It is worthwhile to open our eyes: there is a huge difference between a translated language and the use of a foreign language, even if it is for that purpose.

My dear friend...

If I were you, I'd go home and get a good rest.
Some of what you say is nonsense.

You are part of the problem.
Stop whining!

Get out of the way!
I was a little surprised to see Tom there.
They were careful.
Let's hear this!
They built it.
You should never forget that.
I can't see her.
They're all together.
Tom thought Mary might have been brainwashed.
It seems as if Tom doesn't care about Mary.
Tell me again who will help us.
Tom stopped reading.
You should be careful of them.
Aren't you in Tom's age group?
Sometimes, just a nod of the head is enough to prove that you are listening carefully.
Tom attended the party yesterday.
Ayako, lower your voice a little.
How deep is it?
Bless you!

Eat something!
Did you see a movie or not?
I should probably go now.
Tom threw Mary's sunglasses out the window.
Can I talk to you alone?
Who is ready to apply?
I want to play my bagpipes.
Tom is very strange to me.
We are starving here.
Sami will cry like a baby.
Tom and I love each other.
My late friend betrayed me.

Your eyes are watering.
Let me out!
How does that sound?
Sami was reading a newspaper.
I took a yellow one.
She called him.
You guys!
Hit the ground!
Tom threw three punches at Mary.
Don't stop eating if you don't feel like eating.
Tom was angry with Mary.
Someone stole my money.
This one, please, is a little more expensive.
Tom doesn't seem happy.
The computer is new.
Treat him like a dog.
Patients need medical supplies.
Tom never asked me.
Are we sleeping?
When will we do it?
Tom should buy Mary a ticket, too.
You are crazy.
Is there someone here?
Can I go home now?
She is a woman, not a girl.
Sami told me you were in the hospital.
You will be hungry.
I continued to work.
Shut them down.
Someone is following us.
I moved here last October.
Will you walk with me?
Tom wants to work.
Tom became Mary's friend while living in Boston.
You have no idea.
Tom is much younger than I am.
I finally visited Boston last October.
Let's run after Tom!
Please let me out.
Tom is not a Pokemon.
Someone has invited you.
Hurry up!
This is the truth.
I forgot everything about you.
I love you both very much.
I know these people.
Everything is fine with you.
I want to dance with you.
Have you read this before?
Tom didn't think I would do that.
Tom and I went out together.
Are you okay?
Take this.
I'm not your friend.
I hate coffee.
She teaches English.
Do you think I can be seen?
Leave it to us.
I was sent a message.
Be yourself!
It makes no sense at all.
Ask someone else.
I won't let you pay.
I need to be alone to think.
Walk with caution.
Did Tom believe that?
These birds eat.
Someone is watching you.
He is a congressman.
Tom didn't agree to be here on October 20th.
You are all crazy.
Is something bothering you?
Tom ate a bowl of spaghetti.
Is Tom still crying?
I think it's not true.
Get out of here!
Jaffar is a mess.
They missed the train.
They are dead.
He danced.
This is my opinion, not yours.
They were armed.
Please be quiet!
Tom is anorexic.
The storms began to fall in October.
Go for it!
Tom was angry with Mary.
Go and change your clothes.
The mountain turned him into a pearl!
Someone else has already done it.
Tom couldn't help.
Good luck with your new job.
He hates the Algerian culture.
Go to the house.
What's the problem?
He is gone.
Is there anyone there?
Can you find it?
You could be a writer.
I saw you in my dreams.
You tried it.
Do not make mistakes.
Answer them.
Tom seems busy.
I learned that from you!
I still love Tom.
Get up !
I don't know how to answer your question.
I told Tom not to tell Mary.
He is blind.
Think about it again.
In the silence there is power.
Please do as I say.
You are part of the problem.
Are you blind?
Whose is it?
You drank a cup of coffee.
Can you see?
How long have you been studying?
When did you first go to Australia?
Tom is cheating on Ken.
Tom took the tray out carefully.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
You stayed at home.
Another question.
Tom smiled.
I remembered.
Tom likes to watch Mary dance.
I was wrong.
Someone is watching Tom.
I eat bread.
They answered.
My uncle hurt me.
No matter how tired he is, work awaits him.
You are finished with the murder.
He only takes it for the songs.
"A dog that bites a dog is a fox", says a friend.
She died.
He built it.
He just arrived.
Have you read?
Call me tomorrow.
It is snowing.
You'll see Tom soon.
Send this letter by air.
Tom will accept.
Someone is coming.
He deserves a car.
They were all happy.
The first weapon of a people's pride is its language.
Let go of me!
Just look at my new car.
Read to us.
Where did you find him?
Tom was sitting under a tree.
You can use my computer if you want.
Don't worry about it.
Catch up with Tom.
No one can understand.
Please help me with my homework.
You shouldn't stay here.
The Kabyles love their language.
I have no other choice.
Where were you?
Tom has a new boyfriend.
You want to spend Tom's money.
They all nodded their heads.
She swims well.
She loves to read.
Tom looks scared.
I'll tell Tom you said that.
He gave us all what we wanted.
Tom hated Mary.
What will you do if it rains?
Our teacher hates being questioned by his students while he is teaching.
Just look at my new car.
You are a brave man!
No one saw.
Tom does everything by himself.
He easily burns the grass.
Are you from Tibet?
Follow your foot.
Stop dreaming now.
Have you had dinner yet?
She doesn't smoke.
Tom seems happy.
She loves you very much.
You write very well.
We hope that many of you will come.
I met Tom in the car.
Are you guys from the Czech Republic?
Go and get dressed!
Were you at home?
I met her only once.
Please have his phone.
Did you hear what they said?
The Kabyle culture is beautiful.
Tom was Mary's high school sweetheart.
Is anyone here?
Just let me in.
Eat slowly - Millions of people eat slowly.
Stop the car!
What were Tom and Mary arguing about?
Let her go.
I want to kiss Tom.
Tom and Mary are about to leave.
Have you seen the new movie?
I found your wallet.
He was seduced by her beauty.
I play Chopin.
You look very happy.
He was born rich.
Please pass me the black tea and the black pepper.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
You should try to meet Tom.
I know Tom is a fool.
Tom needs about a dozen eggs.
I was told that Tom was still in Australia.
I'm going to eat at the Chinatown restaurant tonight.
Tom speaks French.
Tom won't talk.
Now that I'm a teacher, I think differently.
Mary likes to buy clothes.
I don't know who killed him.
Sami is six years old.
Stop teaching!
You have to tell Tom the truth.
Someone killed Tom today.
I want you back today.
Get out of here!
Hold him down!
Has anyone mentioned me?
You look European to me.
Someone came to our house.
I want you to tell me the truth.
No, thank you. I'm finished.
Let me explain.
This boy is crazy.
What a fool!
Jeff steals jewelry.
Ask one of the first kids you see.
When was the last time you were drunk?
Someone is home.
In a fit of rage, Tom ran into the barber shop and knocked down some bricks.
The trash is gone.
My wife thinks I'm a fool.
He just talks, not thinks.
I wonder when I'll be at your Halloween party.
Help me out here!
I know this is a long trip.
I have a cold.
Please wait.
I don't know what you like.
French is not only spoken in France.
Stay still and don't move at all.
Take this table.
She is surprised.
Go and have a good time.
Are you new here?
It's a small dog.
What kind of food do you eat?
Anyone can stop me.
Keep your eyes open and close.
Look around again.
Either Tom or someone else said that.
He is tired.
Tom seems to be ready.
You piece of shit!
I didn't know you had a brother.
Speak up!
Shut up!
Tom is unstoppable.
Get down!
Where does Tom live?
Let go of me!
Have you read this book yet?
Tom nearly killed Mary with a gun.
We are on the verge of bankruptcy.
You're not sick, are you?

Tom didn't help Mary.
Is French easy?
Close the door.
I didn't read it well.
Tom didn't want to get married.
She admitted it.
Is he dead?
You are our prisoner.
I was very worried.
You saw Tom do that, didn't you?
Tom didn't raise his head.
None of my relatives can speak French.
There is no excuse.
Today is October 20th.
My younger brother was raised by his grandmother.
I know.
You are really great!
I'll eat it if you eat it.
Stop being angry.
It has value.
Is that really true?
Tom was forced to resign from his job.
Someone else has called.
Tom dressed up as a girl for Halloween.
Tom was robbed last night.
What is your philosophy?
Am I wrong about this?
I won this one.
Where are you living now?
Sami seems to have lost his mind.
You are welcome home.
I'm tired of writing with you.
The truth is more important than anything else.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Someone is calling me.
We picked up the bags and went straight to the market.
Are you still alive?
Tom arrived before Mary.
Sami went back to work.
Do not move.
Are you at home too?
It's like living by a lake.
Tom came alone, Mary didn't.
You're writing.
Try to find a cure.
You had better cut your hair.
Yes, please.
I'm not good at swimming.
Kiss and smile.
Is Jesus really the Son of God?
Say something.
When did you get to Boston?
From now on, we will only speak French.
Sami felt as if he knew Layla.
I just left the tavern in Ukfadu.
This is my favorite dish.
I hope no one saw you come here.
Is that wrong?
You shook me.
Our food is all rotten.
Do good to those who hate you.
No matter how fast you go on the train, you'll never get there in time.
Show me exactly where he lives.
To learn a language, you must know the grammar.
They are all dead.
I hate to work.
Hold on to yourself.

As soon as I was old enough, my nephew passed away.
Can you finish this?
Tom wasn't here last week.
Where is your grandmother?
I believe everything we're told.
She never laughed.
Let them help you.
We heard the door open.
Are you mad?
Are you worried?
There's someone out there.
Sami and Layla are arguing over the value of a four-dollar bill.
They want something to sleep with.
We read these books.
Who are your parents?
They put another cookie in it.
Tom is a man of honor.
What should we say?
How many pounds did you make?
French is difficult.
He walks slowly.
I think they're watching me.
They are smoking.
People are dangerous in Australia.
How strong you are!
Tom likes to do things.
You are a problem.
You are the star here.
I'm always proud of you.
I think you're being deceived.
Hello! How are you?
Tom used to cry a lot.
Tom said he'd never planted a cabbage.
Are you busy now?
Where did you buy your clothes?
Be strong and strong!
You should always have a dictionary in your hand.
Put your clothes on!
I hope you understand.
We left early.
You are our prison.
Tom has more money to buy Mary anything she wants.
Tom agreed to it.
Tom is shy.
Come on in here!
Sami's car was very nice.
You are welcome.
Love is alive.
Close your eyes.
Is there anyone you want to see?
How can I explain it?
Tom left on October 20th.
Are you blind?
How much?
I want someone to talk to.
I don't want to watch TV this afternoon.
Tom and Mary are helping each other.
Sami was busy with his family.
I have a strong desire to make this happen.
Tom and Mary got married in October 2013.
Stay with me for a while.
Go shower in cold water.
October 20, 2013 is Arim.
Tom finished.
Hold them up.
You look European.
This view reminds me of Italy.
It's the third of October.
He is a little boy.
Snow is white, and snowballs are black.
Nobody cares who you are.
Your writing is terrible.
I have a lot of fun.
Someone stole it from me.
I'll wake you up first thing in the morning.
Who is the best footballer in the world?
You don't have any real hope.
To your health!
You must have eaten a lot.
Murder is the crime of the people.
Does anyone in your group speak French?
Will you study today?
It's our turn!
We eat meat.
Tom drinks twice as much as Mary.
I want to know who's next.
Do you want anything else?
Just talk to them.
You can milk cows.
Get out of the way!
You just took them together.
She is angry.
My life is in your hands.
I'm looking for one.
I hope no one sees you like this.
The fairies!
Tom will always remember Mary.
Tom doesn't know Mary.
Tom walked.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
What is your view of what happened?
I am getting dressed.
I was hit by a train.
To be honest, I don't like chickens.
His father has never been abroad.
How many books have you read?
You sound just like your mother.
I'm worried about Tom.
Are you Ukrainian?
It doesn't matter.
It's good that you're starting right now.
What is the tallest tower in Boston?
I studied.
When will you eat?
I listen to music.
I'll call you this afternoon.
Someone put out the fire.
I'm glad I didn't know.
Tom had someone come to his house last night.
Tom didn't nod his head.
I'm not tired today.
Do you like Tom's cooking?
Tom said he didn't want Mary to win.
Try to convince Tom to leave early for this.
Keep the oil out of the fire.
Everything is going to change.
Tom fought Mary in front of everyone.
You have another one.
If you need me, call.
They don't help.
Don't hurt my head.
Can you fix this?
Tom is down.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
I think Tom is tired.
He pushed her so hard that she broke.
We got married on October 20th.
I'm sure they were wrong.
I want to eat the oatmeal.
Tom shouldn't know where Mary lives.
Do you like science fiction movies?
They speak French.
It's better if you tell the truth.
Close the window!
These songs are boring.
Tom is the smart one.
It's not working!
Are you guys talking to me like this?
No one knows what the future holds.
There must be someone who will do it.
Tom gave the apple to the teacher.
Are you asleep?
Tom looks strong.
Everyone was happy that Tom was arrested.
Did you learn to cook or something?
The color of the flower is pink.
I wonder where they are.
I understand
I am in reasonably good health to do that.
Tom doesn't live in Australia anymore.
You are at home.
Run fast, or you'll miss the train.
I met a man who knows Tom.
Look at the cork.
I like pop music.
No one said that.
They all smiled.
This article is a stub.
Do you go to school by train?
Why do people lie?
One day I'll buy the machine that makes my grandfather's camera.
Do you think we'll win?
Try again.
There is no wolf inside.
I said good night.
Tom will stay here.
I think his opinion is valid.
Just look at my new car.
Stop whining!
This table is taken.
Water, please.
This will make you stronger.
Sami is quick to respond on Facebook.
Someone broke this plate.
She didn't study music.
I don't know where he is.
I got caught in the rain.
I know.
Which paper do you want?
She is dreaming.
Does Tom work in Australia?
They are dead.
I can't write this right.
Your father is very strict.
Tom sat in the kitchen next to Mary.
Phrases like "Muslims love Jesus and Moses,... or they love me" are obviously a direct comparison between the hatred of these and the hatred of the Orthodox and Christians. It was only when I saw their TRUMP that I understood them: because they understood, our "community" had learned the lesson of the voice. The fact that the USEKM is only a source of support for those who have come to understand the threat of terrorism and the irresponsibility of the Kamasutra.
Where is your grandmother?
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
Are you Anna?
Please, find him.
Stay here and wait until Tom comes.
Have you seen your desk?
Are you Hungarian?
Look, that kid, he's about to wash himself.
My food is here.
The desk is now open.
I've already been invited by someone.
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom was in a hurry.
Tom came to visit Mary.
Who spoke?
There is no money left in my purse.
The animals are terrified of you.
Tom is honest.
You fell in love.
Everybody knows her.
Please help me open this door.
Can you show me the door?
Get your hands off me.
You expect too much of him.
I probably shouldn't have asked Tom that question.
Stop your whining.
It's all right.
Are you waiting for someone?
This girl is drunk.
Stop fighting each other.
Please come in!
Hurry up.
This happened on October 20th.
How old are you?
You're a great writer.
I love my brothers and sisters.
Don't use this machine in front of the water.
I hope you always come this way.
It's very difficult to find out what this is, this monster.
Stay with us.
Tom left them.
I hope it will always be like this.
Keep your feet here!
I want you to read this letter.
You are wrong.
Tom is smiling.
You heard him, didn't you?
You are dead.
I know that Tom is a student.
We bought a bottle of water.
Keep your head up!
Somebody has to do something.
He left everything.
I can teach you how to read.
He is one of my father's students.
I am very hungry.
You should apologize.
Sami had a bad day.
Sami noticed that Layla's voice had changed.
Do you eat well?
Can you hear me?
We are lucky.
Tom is going to pack everything.
We forgot about it.
Tom is going to Nîmes tomorrow.
Mary bought her children a Halloween costume.
How long will you be staying in Boston?
Why does the Koran say that non-Muslims should be killed?
You are the love of my life.
I hated him, too.
Tom sat down next to his daughter.
Take whatever you can get.
You see? These are the names of the farms in the village of Yssarijen.
They all played.
I don't want to live with you.
Tom seemed to have turned his attention to me.
Please bring us two cups of coffee.
They sent me a word.
Don't you think you speak French better than me?
The dog can walk.
He was allowed to do it.
Tom likes to read.
I told Tom where I wanted to go.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to win.
Tom was looking for Mary.
They left.
She writes poetry.
Stop crying!
I think about it day and night.
The party was so much fun. I wish you were there.
Hold on to yourself.
You are witches.
Where is your uncle?
You couldn't stop the spell.
The rain is too late for the sun.
I'm sure we will.
Bring a weapon.
I like cars.
I always told Tom that Mary wasn't here.
Tom is all wet.
There's no one in this room.
He is very, very kind.
I bought some pizza.
Tom and Mary said, "You don't have to do this by yourself".
Jaafar is imitating his parents.
I can't read.
Can you swim?
I can't sleep with my right eye.
Everybody has to stop.
I hate work.
I need someone to help me do that.
They are very close.
They poisoned him.
You know I can't.
Someone stole my money.
"Do you like snakes?" "Obviously not".
I need to know who.
Stay with me!
Keep it in mind.
Tom wants to annoy Mary.
I have a guitar.
We'll see you in October.
Have you eaten enough?
Send me a letter, please.
Look around you.
Please stop.
Why don't you go to school?
How did you make them laugh?
He is a singer.
Will you let me go?
The Kabyle people are a ethnic group of Kabyle people in northern Algeria.
Tom said he wasn't talking to you.
Are you foreigners?
Your love is not as big as mine.
She loves you very much.
He walked outside.
Tom wasn't anywhere I saw him.
Go and change your clothes.
They all laughed.
I listen to music.
They weren't a disaster.
Wow! Just as she came, she came.
Please look ahead!
Come on over here.
Such a lucky day!
Read it.
I don't know this one.
Tom really loves Mary.
You are worried.
Tom has done that many times before.
Stay away from me.
There is someone there.
I like to read stories to children.
They went to Boston.
Please get up.
Stop the car!
Someone must have stopped you.
This book is important for many reasons.
Is that all?
Maybe later on.
Give me the brake.
Do that!
Hold him down!
Aren't you happy?
Will you let us go now?
Give it to him.
I really love you.
Are you hungry?
Have you seen Tom in Australia?
It's been raining for two days.
No, I don't know your brother.
I'm afraid I'll forget your name.
It's going to be day soon.
I like to swim.
Tom is swimming.
Leave Tom alone.
If the guitar had not been so expensive, I would have bought it.
Tom hasn't seen Mary.
What makes you sad, makes me sad.
Whose are these books?
Why do you want a car?
You didn't leave me!
I hope no one saw you.
I was hungry.
Three days later, Tom died.
Give it to whoever you want.
Are you alone?
Do you want me to open this now?
Take off your hat, you winner: go and get lost!
No one can understand me.
Put on your clothes!
Have some tea.
What do the geeks eat?
I threw them all out.
I'm getting ready for the party.
Tom will miss.
You are a fool!
I'm too old for this.
He'll come to you tomorrow.
Tom is afraid of the wolf.
We are broke.
Now get ready!
Keep your heads up!
Mary likes to go out with her friends.
You shouldn't be sitting here.
This world is a river of tears.
What French dictionary should I buy?
Will you be back later?
Did he use them?
Do you hate Tom?
He will give his opinion either on the rejection of the novel or on the reasoning behind it.
May I ask you a question that is meaningless?
Are you here?
I'm not here to do you any harm.
Who did you give the book to?
Go see if anyone can help.
It started to snow.
Tom knows what you're thinking about.
Please hurry!
When did they leave?
I was in your wedding.
I recognize this voice.
I gave you confidence.
We hope it won't happen again.
It's just that the chicken was eating.
Something has happened.
I hope no one saw you.
No, I don't know your brother.
Tom would cry if Mary was gone.
We can only hope for good results.
The truth is always the same.
Can you come at 9?
He's going to clean up the mess.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Tom visited Mary in Boston in October.
"You live by blood" says the Nazi.
Where do you live?
I can't protect you.
They were crying.
You are worthy.
You're on your own.
I wanted to love Tom.
I can't do this without your help.
Tom is too busy.
I already knew what a contract was... until they asked me.
Tom is calling you.
I'm not trying to stop you.
Whose is it?
Why don't you do something?
Are you hiding?
There are many bars in Rome.
Take it with you.
Someone will pay.
I invited them to the party.
Don't give Tom what he wants.
Go on now!
Tom might be back tomorrow.
Tom is admiring Mary.
You're outside.
The party was very entertaining. I wish you had been there.
Are you tired?
I like rock music.
Tom was attracted to Mary.
I need these letters.
Can someone help me?
You are in Boston.
Do you want to go to a party?
You are lying.
Stop whining.
Their master united the natives in his time.
Have you read this book?
Tom can be annoying.
I hate Halloween.
Who told you that you can't swim here?
What's new here?
We are listening to Celtic music.
Do the same.
My wife thinks I'm crazy.
Tom and Mary are the same height.
We agreed.
Kabyles are learning all the languages of the world.
Did the cow get wet?
Tom died yesterday.
I am from the Netherlands.
Tom is old and deaf.
Tom doesn't know how to use a computer.
I lost my grip.
Tom has his nose pierced.
He wants to ask Mary something.
I want everyone to be happy.
You are idiots.
She wants to go now.
I don't think they trust us.
My parents love me very much.
Are you angry?
I'll call again later.
Tom said that Mary looked sad.
To learn a language, you must know the grammar.
Tom needs someone to help him.
Stay outside.
Things often don't go as planned.
There's no one here.
They are Asian.
Don't stop here.
They want to learn English.
Hello, my dear.
They are happy.
Stay there!
You can have my car.
The Kabyle nation is an island of writers, artists, and poets.
They are afraid.
We just trust him.
A dancing rooster finds him and wakes him.
Tom said he wanted to study French.
She will sleep with him.
You had better comb your hair.
Tom didn't see her.
Labor is free.
What were you reading?
Tom was married to Mary.
I couldn't speak French when I got there.
Algerian manners are disgraceful.
I hate football.
Do you have a home in Australia?
Come home early.
Tom seems to know Mary.
Call us back.
I like Tom.
Come on in here.
Where did you find this key?
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
My wife thought I was crazy.
Somebody is eating.
Is anyone missing?
Speak slowly.
Mr. Jones is here to see you.
Do we really have to go back?
Get out of here!
Don't hit them with a stick.
We know the rules.
I keep on singing.
Your hands are stained with blood.
It will snow before it rains.
You're already here.
I haven't seen Tom anywhere.
Do you speak like Italians?
Tom could have won.
Did Tom earn a lot from you?
I get up at seven.
I can't go to Australia this month.
Are you guys gay?
Are you working tonight?
He turned the other way.
What they call the Amazigh language no one can agree with.
Sami wants to see Layla laugh.
Sit down at the table.
Look in the back!
I don't want you to go back to Boston.
We don't know.
I'm almost there.
Don't you even think about it?
Nothing has changed.
Do you like literature?
Who else uses Tatoeba in your office?
Just be careful.
I miss you so much!
I may have forgotten my keys.
I didn't think Tom needed our help.
Tom made a mistake.
I wish him a good night.
Tom likes to drink wine.
Someone called for you.
It's a friend.
Now that I've done half the work, I need a break.
You're the one I wanted to talk to.
Did my friend surprise you?
Why did you go there?
Can someone help?
Tom couldn't hear Mary.
Take this one.
Jafar is playing his own game.
Tom spent a lot of time after work playing computer games.
What are you doing?
Someone is calling.
I'll take care of the ladders.
Tom said he didn't know the rules.
I think there's someone in the next room.
Everyone hopes that nothing bad will happen.
It is clear.
You came back!
We waited.
I remember seeing this movie.
You said you were going to go after him.
There is a wind.
I'm going to live in the city.
I'll never forget the day I met Tom.
I was not a good student in high school.
Tom is drunk.
I left the house before Tom came in.
You just have to stay here.
Try to make it harder.
Did you give Tom a birthday present?
Tom and Mary came to Boston with me.
Stay with us.
You're not helping.
Tom always dresses well.
I did not sleep.
Do you live here?
I hope no one saw you.
I love you very much.
Did you paint this picture?
I want to have someone to talk to.
Please put me in my chair.
I have a bad cold.
Tom doesn't believe the story is true.
Have you read this book yet?
Please answer in French.
I'm not angry with you. I'm just sorry.
Tom hasn't written to me since last October.
Yuba is the Amazigh king.
Come here!
The police are looking for Tom.
Read this!
What a bitch!
Am I wrong?
I'm not a person who is easily offended.
That's good.
Has anyone mentioned my name?
My grandfather likes to read.
When you've finished your work, you'll be back.
I want to be a movie star.
I know Tom is a millionaire.
Tom is a man of his word.
Sami sat in the chair.
Tom kissed Mary.
Hold him down!
He's not such a good man!
I am cold to the bone.
Where do you cook them?
The car broke down.
My father bought a new bicycle.
Sami is wearing my shoes.
Give it to whoever you want.
I lost the right eye.
Russia has produced many famous people such as Lenin, Stalin, Malenkov, Kručev, Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenku, Gurbachev, Eltsin, Medvedev, and Putin.
I don't know the truth.
I hope no one saw you.
They are Kabyle.
Bring the samples.
Someone has seen it.
I like Russian food.
I grew up in school.
Are you going?
They don't want me to buy them what to wear.
They agreed.
He didn't write or say anything.
This is a bicycle.
You tried.
You are very different from us.
Bob saved me.
Do you have a younger sister?
Please leave me your book.
Tom and I are still married.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
Who is the mole?
What's on the menu today?
When in Rome, live like a Roman.
You rang the bell.
Tom is alone in the forest.
Stop that noise!
This building has a small courtyard.
I hear someone talking.
We have returned from Australia.
Don't worry. I'm here for you.
Tom sent this note.
Try to scare Tom.
Are you there?
We are not talking!
I was a manager for three years.
I wish him a year of peace and prosperity.
I'm tired of your jokes.
You talk too fast.
A little bit of ice, please.
You're making fun of me!
Hurry up!
What did I win?
Stop it now.
Drive carefully.
Do you write in French?
I lost a lot.
Mr. West called while you were away.
You should come with me.
Stop right there.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Tom and Mary are sitting together on the couch.
Sami is currently in prison for armed robbery.
Someone was watching Tom.
I took an aspirin.
Mary is disappointed.
Snow is white, and snow is black.
How is it?
I'm sorry for your loss.
Did you use it?
Call him.
I did that, too.
Layla is very beautiful.
Has anything changed?
She has a gun.
They are late.
It's too late.
Tom is a good singer.
Are you dead?
Tom will stand trial on October 20th.
I'm getting married in October.
I like to read.
They all danced.
I can get you something to eat.
You shouldn't be such a person.
You're not going to make it!
How did you spend your time in Boston?
I forgot everything about you.
We are fighting.
It's not worth it!
I want her to help me do this.
Put on your coat. It's cold outside.
Get it out, Tom.
I drink milk.
You are part of the problem.
Let me go!
She always changes her mind.
I can't write.
I knew it was Tom's reading.
Open your eyes.
He works very hard.
Open your eyes!
Tom is my nephew.
As the clouds are high, I fly over my great country.
Tom went to Australia with me.
After I closed all the doors, I went to bed.
Only Tom will come.
Drive carefully.
I use Firefox.
I was wrong.
Are you young?
Tom said he was happy with the results.
Do as I tell you.
Why don't you want Tom to know?
Tom spent the whole night joking about politics with his friends.
Tom is stubborn.
It rained last night.
Please come in.
You won't die here.
Tom gave me his key.
Keep reading!
Read this book out loud.
Tom has his own reasons for learning French.
Are you new?
Will you do this to me?
Sami was a child when he was a child.
Tom didn't tell me he was mad.
I need to buy something to eat.
He has a point.
Someone is singing.
Tom said he wanted to sleep.
You are crazy!
For what?
You can change that if you want.
Tom started to yell at me.
Have you read this?
Hey yourself!
Will you have time to eat before the meeting?
Tom lives with his family in Australia.
Come by yourself.
They caught him.
Did you reach your goal?
I thought we were just going to talk to Tom.
Are you waiting for someone?
Do that!
We are at home.
He who does not reap and does not sow, eats what he finds.
Have courage!
Welcome to Canada!
We agreed.
Mr. Sato called while you were out.
I want someone to talk to.
There he is!
Give it to her.
Are you going to Boston tomorrow?
You have a bad habit.
I don't agree with you on this.
Please sing!
Tom has known Mary since he was a child.
I won't accept your mistakes again.
Did you eat the pork?
That's cool, Tom.
We planted trees.
I haven't had dinner yet.
They are all hard.
You have a lot of friends.
Did anyone come?
Please introduce me to a beautiful girl.
You can often see Tom swimming.
You are a bitch!
Tom said he needed to borrow some money.
Tell me again who will help us.
There is one outside.
Tom thought he was a failure.
I'm not interested in this matter.
I think there's something in the box.
You're mad at me for saying that.
They all shook hands.
Are you mad?
If he tells you to wash, wash.
You are too tall!
Tom hated it.
Is that a cat?
She can speak Japanese.
When do I go to Boston?
Come back then!
Where did she go?
Tom went to Mary.
We were beaten.
Tom never asked me out.
Sami is starting to realize this.
I think Tom is healed.
Someone has just read it.
We are sleeping downstairs.
Tom turned yellow.
She will do it.
Sami liked to do that.
The woman is reading.
Is anyone at home?
Tom is tired.
The Kabyle language is a language like other languages.
I hope no one saw you do it.
You are a problem.
Why can't we eat here?
He killed an ass with a machete.
Are you Ukrainians?
There is someone there.
Either Tom or someone else said that.
They are all naked.
It's a very serious matter, Tom, isn't it?
This goat eats almost everything.
I don't want to get up!
Close the window!
Why didn't you take it before our meeting?
Have you read everything?
This is a disaster!
I can teach you how to read.
You are part of the problem.
I'll come by later.
I don't feel like reading tonight.
Shut your ass up!
You can eat a goose whenever you want.
Someone is watching.
Tom didn't answer the phone properly.
Who invited you to the wedding?
What would you talk about, then?
I'm not worthy of it.
I hope Tom is scared.
Are you married?
Thank you for telling us this.
Who is dead?
Sami used to talk a lot.
She is drinking cold water.
I will stop.
Try this one.
Are these yours?
She speaks Japanese.
I haven't changed. You have.
It's still warm.
Tom and Mary always argue.
I need someone to help me do this.
This is the meat.
She is talking.
I got it!
I like the choices I have here.
I have a great idea.
Shut the door.
I like a lot of jokes.
Mary Abbott was murdered.
If you want to eat this, you can.
The butterfly is a night bird.
Do you have a brother, Ana?
We thought Tom didn't have any friends in Boston, but here he seems to have found himself.
What do you think?
Tom lied about where he was that day.
Tom is drunk.
Find the cat.
Have you had tea?
Is that true?
You are both very lucky.
What else can you do?
It's not easy because this project requires a lot of money.
My mind is spinning!
Tom is homeless.
When I finish my work, I'll come back.
They asked.
Are you foreigners?
Tom isn't with Mary.
Who knows?
Something has happened.
Please drink red wine.
The student is finished.
What's wrong with your hat?
Can you stop yelling?
He drove his car into the garage in a hurry.
With pleasure.
You are awake.

Bees eat insects.
That's what Tom does.
Mary was reading Tom.
Tom did a flight test.
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Eat up !
The bulb is red.
Do you like science fiction movies?
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
Do you understand or not?
Have you seen this movie?
Whether you are a pig or a bear, they will hear you until you are dead, unless you are dead.
I can't stay here.
Are you new?
I was on the mountain.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Please tell me which one to take.
It's not possible.
You are a doctor.
I will be thirty in October.
You can come back any day.
At home we call him Tony.
He's not good.
Your problem is that you think you should do whatever your parents tell you to do.
Sami is gone.
Are you expecting someone?
He is slow to walk.
Do you think I'm beautiful?
I was afraid.
When do you want to eat?
I love you very much.
My back hurts a little.
Where is your God now?
Give me your papers!
Sami doesn't know what's going on there.
I'm ready to go.
I think I can count on you.
Please be careful.
Adultery is prohibited in many religions.
Please, forget this matter.
Go and find someone who can help.
I never thought I'd do that.
He helped us.
Speak with discretion.
Please read it to him by phone.
Are you really going to eat all of this?
You're crazy to keep working in a place like this.
Please be careful.
What?
Kabyle is your light.
I don't think Tom did it.
Your older sister will meet you.
They are all praying.
What happened to what we asked for?
I love you just the way you are.
Take care of yourselves.
Somebody is looking at Tom.
Take it off!
He won!
I think I can rely on you.
I want to eat now.
If I had, I would have told you.
See you, Sayoko.
Are you sure that the person you saw was Tom?
Do what you can.
I have nothing to say.
They're looking for you.
I stopped smoking.
Champagne and a bell.
Who is it?
She laughed.
Raves is the artist's name, but his real name is Arezqi Cebli.
Is there anything you want?
I only know French and English.
The sale of beer is a public holiday.
Tom was disgusted when he tried to do that.
All people change.
I know what Tom is doing.
Get up on your feet!
It hurts here.
Let me explain.
Here is the car.
Can I go home now?
When are we going to do it?
I think Tom saw it.
I saw the guy who was talking to Tom.
Can we talk about it in the morning?
Look at her.
Tom feels sorry for me.
I'm not surprised that I'm writing a book now.
God will protect you.
I was born to love you.
Be courageous.
Come in early.
I know you.
I'm tired to death.
She didn't expect to see him.
I know your language.
I want it.
You cleaned your room.
He speaks several languages.
No one will hurt you.
What time is it in Boston now?
Give me the book.
I saw a bird.
Tom is angry.
They understood.
You've got to be careful!
Tom was pleased with the win.
Someone is reading something now.
Mary has to run.
Tom can't cook.
Tom looks small.
I hope you'll be back in Boston soon.
You are John.
When you have time, read this book.
Women are going to be angry.
They can't believe that anyone would ever be ashamed of that.
Do you have friends who don't eat rice?
It's the 20th of October.
I like to read.
She is dreaming.
You are crazy!
I need someone to help me do this.
Are you famous?
Mary was poor, though she could have been rich.
You are wrong.
Do you think it will make the time?
What book are you reading?
They are so beautiful!
Can we meet later?
Tom went to help Mary.
Have you ever played dead-ball with Tom?
Please don't cry.
Tom gave Mary a gift.
Have you ever added an article to Wikipedia?
Do you eat here or go with you?
They believe you.
Tom works at home.
My hands are sore.
Why did you pick on Tom?
Have you read this?
We returned to Australia on October 20.
Sami really loves Layla.
Why did you come so late?
The horse is a hunter.
Are you having dinner at home today?
Sami learned Arabic in Cairo.
Have courage!
They want to be rich.
Someone has called you.
Don't let anyone near the fire.
Have you read "Moby Dick"?
Who is this, please?
Stop being lazy.
Are you afraid?
Have you read this book yet?
That's why Tom didn't do that.
Are you two foreigners?
Tom said he wanted to do that, but he didn't.
I'm out of words.
It's a good thing we have Tom working on our project.
When did Tom get back from Boston?
Mary is hiding.
They tried to seduce me.
That is true.
Are you German?
We know you lied to Tom.
You were wrong.
Tom will eat.
Tom could talk for hours about birds.
Are you ready?
Has the Russian ambassador returned yet?
Choose a good dictionary next to you.
I understand why Tom did it.
Why isn't Tom being helped?
I respect you.
Tom went to Boston at the end of October.
Will they speak French?
Something is bothering Tom.
Ja'far has turned his back on his horse.
I regret that I can't learn all the languages of the world.
Dancing is a crazy game.
Please don't leave me.
Stop fighting with each other.
It's a wonder!
I told Tom that I would wait for him.
The Amazigh is a language that no one can understand.
Tom can't wait here alone.
You shouldn't be so rude.
The traveler saw a light in the distance and was delighted.
Tom's contract is up on October 20th.
Tom is a goldsmith.
Eat with your tongue.
I'll do my best not to waste your chances.
When did Tom leave?
This is good news.
"Do you want to be a millionaire?" "Who's afraid?"
I do this every day.
We have to do something.
I am from Ireland.
Sami came into the house for lunch.
You are very rich!
How did we get to this point?
History records that the legs were cut, although it was never easy.
Take it easy.
Tom never talked about you.
I really like playing golf.
Tom will be thirty years old next October.
Why do people lie?
I didn't know that Tom had a lot of friends.
You are such assholes!
Ibki loves the one who has betrayed him.
Are you new?
What was stolen?
Close your eyes.
How are you?
Tom wants someone to look up to.
This dictionary is useless.
Tom is tall.
Tom might know something.
If you want a good seat, there's nothing like a good time.
No one answered.
Tom wants us to be seen.
Are you ready?
Do you have a younger sister?
You're going to have a little sister.
I caught three fish this morning.
Tom's room is always cleaned.
He was working.
Are you afraid of horror movies?
Tom was busy day and night.
I know that Tom is a foreigner.
It's not even October yet.
Tom advised me not to buy a used car.
Tom will eat later.
You should be careful.
What time will you be home?
Tom smells like a dog.
I thought the problem was solved.
Give it to someone who wants you.
That's a good question, Tom, or what?
How are you?
We have to do something.
She is English.
You are our prisoner.
It's raining.
Tom can't sleep without light.
You should go back home.
I need to talk to someone.
That's it!
Don't talk to Tom.
With your health.
Let me know if there are any changes.
Please take a step forward.
Tom and I think alike.
What do they want from them?
Tom is Mary's husband.
Tom said he'd leave the door open.
Are you there?
You'll find the tape of his car in his room.
I was told not to do that.
Tom is a good teacher.
Tom will let Mary do that.
I haven't seen Tom since the Halloween party.
People are afraid of thunder.
They want to return.
I love you very much.
Are you speaking?
Tom probably did it on October 20th.
I don't have a very good dictionary.
The fire ants kill plants.
The trees are dead.
Tell it to them.
Help yourself.
Tom's dog is yelling at me.
Tom is writing something.
Lovers are silent.
I just want to pay, please.
I don't think like you.
We heard the door open.
Tom left Mary, disappointed that she was not with the object of his desire.
In the 1980s, Polish farmers came to the country to milk cows.
Tom is relaxed.
Please go through it.
Did you try the chicken?
Someone is watching you.
The girl looks like her mother.
Tom returned last October.
These things are very useful.
To tell the truth, I'm not a man or a woman.
I want to try to do something else.
Have you all read it?
Please don't die.
Some people are wrong.
You are in your own country.
Tom was telling Mary something.
Look carefully. I'll show you how to do it.
I haven't been to Boston since October.
Tom is wearing his hat.
I bought you something to eat.
The test is about to be taken.
Go find Tom.
There is no doubt!
Tom tried to stab Mary.
Tom said he wanted to do it.
Do you think I should do that?
Tom died in Boston at the age of thirty.
Take these.
Tom was elected.
Tom looks small.
My dog has a long tail.
Tom seemed a little drunk when I visited yesterday.
I dated a French-speaking girl in high school.
You are Americans.
Tom was beaten by a police officer.
This is you.
You are the apple of my eye.
Let the animals out of their cages.
I'll buy it for you.
Finish your apology.
I know Tom doesn't want to be involved in anything.
You tricked me!
She went to Boston.
Someone is watching us.
He didn't refuse, he didn't want to.
Tom didn't know I was hungry.
Tom is going to be third on October 20th.
I like the dog.
I don't believe that.
Welcome home.
You are a jerk.
Who invited you to the wedding?
Where did you forget your umbrella?
What do you think of his new novel?
What a handsome young man!
I don't think I should speak like a native speaker. I just want to be able to talk to the audience.
Yes, two.
You should read this.
I hope to God no one sees me like this.
I am running in the dark.
I can teach you how to sing.
My father is used to walking.
Tom hated Mary.
I'm not your maid!
How can a fat man like you eat so much?
Have you become a psychopath?
Thank you for listening.
Just look at my new car.
Where was I?
They are perfect.
What paper do you want?
That's where you're wrong.
October is three months from now.
I wish it would always be like this.
You have more.
Tom is starting to gain weight.
Stay for a while.
You were obviously wrong.
Many houses were burned.
Why don't they say anything?
Tom stayed with someone.
I'm afraid we won't arrive early.
My mother's father is my mother's grandfather.
No one knows.
You're always together.
There's nothing there.
Keep running!
I hope you learned something from your mistakes.
You should write a novel.
Someone called for you.
I went out to sleep at night.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
Do you play sports?
You are.
Your word is worthless.
Are you rich?
Be careful not to forget us!
Are you finished?
We finished it.
Above all, be honest and mature.
This is your land, isn't it?
I hate to fail.
Someone has to go first.
Sami got into Layla's car.
I hope you'll listen to me.
I'm going to bed.
Check the Facebook.
I bought it.
They don't need anything.
They asked something.
Tom is angry.
The cells are thick.
Tom never gave his shirt to anyone.
Everyone is talking.
Tom knows you're lying.
What else?
Did you talk to them or not?
What can I say!
I'm going to take a leave in October.
You are shy.
To your health!
Tom doesn't know I'm here.
"Destruction is not yet here", said Titus Livus.
You are all very kind.
You were praying.
Of course you are!
I know you're right.
I'll call you before I go.
I can't go swimming with you today.
She drank too much water.
Open your book.
When someone is in your way, don't bother them.
Why are you crying?
She is reading.
Tom likes Mary.
He is used to getting up early.
His hair grew.
Look at it.
Tom killed Mary by mistake.
You know the way.
What's wrong with me going to Boston by myself?
Write in Spanish.
You should ask someone else.
He is not a soldier.
It's too heavy for me to lift.
Please don't be disappointed.
The flowers are beautiful!
How could you not know?
The Kabyle nation has always lived in peace even during the period of Turkish occupation in North Africa.
It seems like we should do that.
Come on, boys! Let's have a look.
Stop whining.
They have a problem.
Wipe the apple before eating it.
Tom said that he should learn French.
Tom is swimming.
They must be asleep.
Good news awaits us at home.
Shut your trap!
I smelled something.
Let go!
I want to show you some translated texts for reference.
I don't know him.
Tell him that I love you.
Did you hear what they said?
I hope no one saw you.
Mine is bigger than yours.
I said what I had in my heart.
I like lemonade.
Lock it up!
I flew to Boston on October 20th.
I'll buy it for you.
Tom was kidnapped.
Keep running!
Somebody will do it.
Go and get dressed.
This watch is reduced by three watches a day.
Tom is lost.
Put it in a small bowl.
How are you?
Are you laughing at me?
Her eyes are red.
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't do that.
Are you finished?
Tom is tired.
I left my keys in the car!
Wait outside.
Is my friend enough for you?
No one is listening.
My shoulder hurts.
Why doesn't Tom want you here?
The police think that Tom was stabbed before his neck was cut.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is thinking.
No one remembers.
What is your father's hobby?
Faith is a form of ignorance. It is a form of ignorance that makes people believe.
I won't let you go.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
These pictures are beautiful.
Can you speak French?
Tom hopes to be in Boston by the end of October.
What are you doing?
Help me with this.
Tom forgot Mary's phone number.
Am I making you happy or not?
I speak French better than Tom.
Sam followed me on Snapchat.
I saw a guy named Tom.
Tom called me.
She is one of the oldest living scientists in Japan.
She lied.
Are you cold?
Don't leave the kitchen without a charger.
Tom is the son of a famous teacher in Boston.
Can we say no?
I bought some new bread.
It is not the murderers who believe.
Why is this so important?
You are our prisoners.
Are you crazy now?
She did.
We're not tired now.
Where did you get this piece of your hat?
Do you want me to call him?
I want you to stay in Australia, you who have the alarm and the alarm.
I hope to see you in October.
I didn't think Tom needed our help.
Tom doesn't know that I know.
He looks good.
Your father is very rich.
Tom was the last person to see Mary alive.
Tom is lying on the table.
Let her go.
That's right.
How I miss you!
Tom knocked on the door again.
Are you two sisters?
Tom will never change.
Tom ordered someone to steal his food.
He likes to read books.
He went to see her when she lived in London.
Someone is missing.
The cat is back.
How are things in Australia?
Tom likes to talk about gardening.
I need you to do something.
Sami has not spoken about Layla yet.
Let me look at what you wrote.
Tom saw her, too.
Leave it as a soup.
Tom is unmarried.
He was looking for his pen.
I understand that.
The auctions will be held after October 20th.
I'm expecting a child.
I can't see very well.
Just shut up.
This is my wife.
I don't have any money in my pockets.
The sky is a great loss to mankind.
They all left.
You made me.
I hope no one saw you come here.
I hope no one saw you come here.
Why don't we let you do that?
I just have one question.
We don't use the toilet unless it's necessary.
I hope to play the guitar.
Hold your horses!
Come with me.
Like Tom and Mary, they don't know how to speak French.
Tom gave Mary a gift.
Read it.
Say hello to him.
I miss you so much!
Someone has to pay.
I like to watch Western movies.
Tom hates Mary.
Please be quiet.
They are so sad.
Tom has many good ideas.
She is a witch.
I don't have many friends in Boston.
We have nothing to eat.
Are you ready to go?
Sami entered the store.
Please laugh!
I want to travel abroad.
Where do you live now?
Tom said he could come back on October 20.
Look carefully.
Call him if you have any questions.
I'll go now if it's cold.
We all hate you.
She can go.
Which paper do you need?
Follow Tom!
I hope no one saw you come here.
Is your father coming to dinner tonight?
I left Australia on the twentieth of October.
She loves him.
I'm going to go out and get something to eat.
He was drunk.
Tom's walking has taught me a lot since the beginning.
He is renting his apartment to his father.
We must establish a law against violence in workplaces, or in the suburbs, education and criminal activity. This is what our constitution and laws demand.
When will you come to see me?
The coronavirus has spread to the general population.
Just tell her what she said.
This is easy.
I'll go with you.
Have you all lost your minds?
Tom was passing Mary.
Just do what I did!
You are wrong.
Tom built a house this tall.
Someone stole my money.
Your writing is fascinating.
I lied when I said I didn't like Tom.
No one is off.
I will start work on the first of July.
There is much we can do to help these families.
I don't understand any of this.
Tom will marry Mary.
Tom pulled out a card.
Mary's words are easy to translate.
They're laughing at you.
You speak my language.
I am happy here.
When Tom and I went to Boston, we visited Mary.
When you have time, read this book.
I'll see him tomorrow.
Please answer me verbally.
Tom was lucky.
What can I say!
Tom asked Mary.
It's a long way to go.
Try to understand it.
Are you ready?
Someone was watching us.
You remind me of someone.
Pack your bags.
We want to get to know you.
Does everyone like music?
I ran away.
Let the animals out of their cages.
Put on your clothes.
So what do you want?
He got up.
Tom and I despised Mary.
He did well!
They all stood.
Have some fun!
Can't she understand?
I've got your number.
Hello, what's your name?
Tom and Mary know that they were forced to do that.
The police are looking for me.
We are here!
Are you a foreigner?
There was a large waiting crowd.
Tom called Mary to the meeting.
Live your dreams.
I'll show you how it's done.
Say goodbye to your friends.
I guess not.
Tom is confused.
Tom got word that Mary was following him.
It's too late.
She came after Tom.
Read this book.
Tom said he didn't intend to fight.
They're still after us.
What time will you be home?
Is someone hurt?
I hope no one saw you come here.
Tom is a cop.
This party is not for you.
You are like the man who builds a house with bricks and mortar.
Everybody knows.
No one wants to be rude.
I brought you some food.
Tom got us into the song.
Will you let us go now?
The river is very muddy.
Read this book.
I can't take it off.
I like it a lot.
I heard what happened.
Sami and Layla haven't lived together for six years.
Are you crazy?
She hates the Algerian culture.
I'm looking for a pen.
This is my phone.
I can stay in Boston until October.
Do you care what people think of us?
Mohand Belqasem works every Thursday and I go live on Facebook.
Sami is a criminal.
If you want to go, go now!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I think it's a beautiful place.
Tom said he doesn't speak to you alone.
You are part of the problem.
Have we met before?
She speaks ten languages.
If you eat it, you will die.
It's a race against time.
This is all we have.
I think I understand.
It's a little hot today.
She is Tom's sister, isn't she?
Tom is angry.
Tom always thinks about Mary.
Tom didn't care about you.
Dreams are beautiful!
Tom said he'd never driven a truck before.
Has anyone seen anything?
I know that Tom is a billionaire.
She laughed.
This will make you warm.
I hope it's a dream.
You are blinded by love.
You have me all dressed up!
Who complained?
Are you Julius?
Do you have any other questions?
Tom isn't like that.
You will find someone.
Stop crying.
It is Kabyle.
He didn't make a fuss about it.
Are you people?
All my problems are over.
I wish no one had seen you come here.
Alice smiled at me.
I'm not a man or a woman, after all.
Please lock the door.
You have to live!
I don't want to go alone.
The stone said to the frog: "I will drink". The frog said to him: "What shall I drink?"
God will take care of you like a duck: one will take care of the other.
Somebody has to do it.
My son is a man now.
Is it okay if I ask a question that is not relevant?
Here is your card.
Tom knows.
Have you studied?
I lost.
He recently sent me a sad poem he wrote about his mother's death.
Open your eyes!
They decided.
Tom is a better singer than Mary.
Do you learn to cook or something?
Tom likes to play football.
Sami still has his guitar.
Everybody loves you.
Tom and I can't both be right.
Where is your grandmother?
Come out to the street!
They all cheated.
Translating from your second language into your mother tongue, rather than taking any other language, will make it easier for you to learn only the parts.
Did you do all that?
Let them help you.
Are you helping him?
Neither of them asked for help, like Tom and Mary.
There is no trust where there is no democracy.
The one who is weak is weak.
Tom and Mary are the same age.
Has anyone died?
No one cares.
Tom threw it away.
Are you lying?
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I'm doing the right thing.
Sami read Layla's message.
I want you to get up.
You agreed to pay.
Tom continued reading.
Are you kidding me?
Tom was attracted to Mary.
You should do this work.
I think you did it against your will.
She is studying English.
Please help me.
Are you crazy?
They all applauded.
Tom and Mary looked like John and Alice.
They are married.
You should talk to Tom.
Who ran away?
Tom's birthday is on October 20.
She killed him.
A small joke can make a big joke.
Tom was surprised.
I saw a dog.
I'm very scared.
Help me out here.
The festival will begin in October.
Tell me again who will help us.
I can't just leave you here.
Sami doesn't know who this lady is.
What do you call this fruit?
Please take me home.
I hope no one saw you do it.
I like the way you kiss me.
Have you finished your work?
What language is that?
You are a good student.
Is that a desert?
You'll find someone who left it here.
Whose is it?
Are you ashamed?
Tom has many good gifts.
Keep moving!
Tom and I followed Mary.
Don't worry about the details. It's easy.
Why does Tom need a knife?
Tom is sleeping.
Come back to us!
If you don't want to read, stop.
Are you crazy?
I bought a bag of matches.
We crossed there.
Let's dance again.
Please.
Somebody must have done something.
They fell.
Are you finished?
Is this guy your friend?
Mary knew that we believed her.
Change your clothes!
We wanted to listen.
Aren't you glad that she's rich?
Look around. What do you think?
Say whatever you want, I won't believe you.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Sami was out that night.
Take this one.
They all laugh.
Tom thought no one had seen him.
What do you feed your puppy?
I'm not your love.
Sami went to the game.
Tom moved to Boston in October.
The moon remained bright.
Thank you for your call.
There is one I know.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
Tom waited his turn.
Tom said he wasn't smoking anymore.
You made me laugh!
Kurt Cobain died on April 5, 1994 in Seattle.
I will be back in October.
I have a daughter.
Tom felt uncomfortable.
The dragon visited the library.
She swims well.
I will pay with cash.
The search is over.
Can you please help Tom?
Tom bought this for us.
I don't want to go to the party.
I like to read.
Tom was clearly contemplating Mary.
Please give me a kilo of tomatoes.
Take your strength.
Sami felt something move against his waist.
Ken is a liar.
You should eat something.
Are we finished yet?
Take me to the top.
Why did you write this book?
Tom wants Mary.
Stop reading!
No one is inside.
Tell the light.
You can't stop us.
My grandfather was still in the old school, always complaining about how girls dress now.
This is for you.
Don't forget to ask Tom to do that today.
It worked!
Did you know that Zinedine Zidane is a Kabyle?
Please feed the dog every day.
I have to watch Tom.
You are a fool to me.
Just let me in.
Are you Canadian?
You're making fun of me.
I still hate Tom.
The competition will run until October 20th.
Please.
What you said is correct.
I have to go to Australia next week.
Is there someone you'd like to read to?
He is alive!
I can kill you.
Are you making a sandwich?
Tom told me that he loved you very much.
Clean it all up.
Tea with lemon, please.
I'm feeling good about myself.
Release the animals from the cage.
Tom was supposed to be back.
It's a shame you called me.
Shut up!
Sami and Layla were having sex.
You look Japanese.
Go to school!
It is cold.
Sami taught Layla how to play the guitar.
He's blown your mind.
I brought you coffee.
Tom has been told that many times.
Tom told Mary something.
She is very smart.
It happens.
Mary told me she was lucky.
Does Tom know much about you?
You're annoying me!
There is no problem.
You are joking.
We should try again some other time.
Someone saw something.
I was sad when I kissed Tom.
She is stingy.
Just look at my new car.
I won.
You are hot.
We are here.
Who won?
Follow that!
Tom will miss it.
I don't know if I have the time.
Was that Tom's painting that you found?
Sami brought his girlfriend out.
She understood it.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
There's someone at home.
Tom is walking.
Show them to me.
Come on in, all of you!
Come by when you like.
They are idiots.
Just follow him.
Tom looked me in the eye.
She might come.
I need someone to help me.
Why does Tom need me?
You fooled me!
Are you really going to send me a Japanese doll?
Sami sees Layla once a year.
Come with us!
You don't have to do that at all.
Tom is being bullied.
So, how did he die?
Shut up!
Tell your friends to leave.
They were looking out the window.
I did that without anyone's help.
Stop beating my head.
Tom never thought he'd do that.
Sami doesn't need that.
I can go to your house tomorrow.
I'm not going swimming today.
Your words have no meaning.
Tom looks happy.
I was born in this hospital.
Are you a thief?
I need you to do something.
Tell me the truth.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
You have a stain of spines on your teeth.
Give it to anyone who wants it.
How many friends do you have who don't eat meat?
Do you have time for a meal?
They all stink.
Tom asked us to be quiet.
She died of a stroke.
I was told something I didn't know.
Who ordered it?
Marie should start.
It is true.
Let go of me!
You won't make any mistakes.
The bees are doing a good job.
I know.
Shut up!
Where are you studying?
You are human beings.
I lost my life.
They are all waiting.
You're lucky to have come here.
The lions are smart.
Call them.
Is Tom being funny?
Meet me there.
There must be someone who can stop us.
Tom is sleeping with someone.
Stop crying.
Tell him that.
I was afraid.
Tom worked with Mary.
Tom is sweating.
She was the only one drunk at the wedding.
Do you know me? - No, I don't think so.
Tom can understand Mary.
Hello to everyone.
God is terrible!
I hope Tom will leave me alone.
Your pie is hot, my friend.
Do you know how this works?
Follow your sister's path.
I'm worried about her.
They all got out.
Tom and Mary are as different as black and white.
Tom never learned how to read or write.
This will make you stronger.
Tom is your father.
She also lost her virginity.
Why don't you want to go to Tom's house?
You look pretty this evening.
Tom is out of the house right now.
Tom died in October.
The work is going fast.
Tom was right about Mary.
We all hate him.
They bought a bottle of water.
You were supposed to do it yesterday.
Is that what love is?
Is there anything you don't like to eat?
Someone broke into my car.
I didn't read it.
Tom will be proud of us.
The Lebanese actress and her friends wrote a book.
Tom already planned to leave early.
Do it now.
Tom left the country on October 20.
How can we fight the British?
She needs to rest.
You already paid.
Tom said it was hard to do.
I've written in Kabyle on Tatoeba before; it's been a long time.
Who did you expect to win?
Tom likes to hunt.
The young girl is popular among Japanese teachers.
The stone said to the rock, "I will break it". The rock replied, "What shall I say?"
I'll show you how it's done.
You know Tom would do that, don't you?
You are a fool.
There is enough water for two days.
Do you have any cats?
Tom wanted to help Mary.
Tom is a very shy boy.
Aren't you going to read this book?
You can't speak French, can you?
You are wrong.
She'll stay with him.
When is the next flight to Boston?
I heard you don't eat meat.
I kept my word.
Tom posted his blog in October.
Are you ready to eat all this?
You're not really a nurse.
Are you Americans?
Show me someone special.
I thought you couldn't read.
Your writing is very interesting.
Tom is nearly dead.
The chicken is crying, the rooster is hurt by his own snoring.
Stop them!
Tom only slept for a few hours.
Why did you delay Tom?
You are more tired.
I didn't think Tom would be this tired.
Come by whenever you want.
You can use my dictionary.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Read this now.
Tom recognized her.
Did you swim yesterday?
Start there!
When was the last time you went to Boston?
Tom told her that he wrote the play two years ago.
He's been standing here for a long time.
I'm afraid for you.
Have you read this?
I laughed.
You are afraid.
You can go home now.
You are a dog.
Some children are swimming in the river.
How many sandwiches are left?
Thank you all.
Tom is alone.
Being here has helped me a lot.
A man went to his friend's house; when he returned, he found the girl. Her mother smiled and said to her, "Oh, my dear, are these real?" He replied, "Oh, I just ate the apple and said yes!" "School, then... Your father will be very happy!"
There is a monkey that eats.
What a person does, whether it be literature, music, art, poetry or anything else, always comes out as a reflection of himself.
How are you?
I like to travel.
Where is your aunt?
Why don't you pay attention to what the teacher is saying?
How do you like your eggs?
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
There is a piano in the room.
I used to fall in the snow a lot when I was little.
Tom and I are married now.
Someone stole my food.
You drive.
What are you looking for, man?
They are.
What is your room number?
I told the truth.
Do you have any friends?
Tom doesn't like me anymore.
Tom is better than Mary at singing.
I assume you like your work.
The authors of these comics are not mine.
I brought you coffee.
Tom was fired from his job in October.
Ahmed is full of energy.
Clean your room.
Why don't you go and see Tom?
Tom told me that he loved me.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
I'm a close friend of Tom's father.
This is a little bit of a shock for you, isn't it?
Has anything changed there?
The game is too late.
The snow has been falling since dawn.
Freedom comes with forgiveness.
Richard Dawkins is a famous philosopher.
Where is your God now?
Are you clear or not?
I wrote you a note.
They all danced.
Have you tried it?
This is their last film.
You are a little late.
Are you hungry?
Tom didn't know how to describe it exactly.
Can I go home now?
You are lying.
There's nothing funny about it.
Tom called to say he wouldn't come.
Poetry is medicine, then.
He repeated it a second time.
Sami started with this man.
Go to the shade!
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
Come out of there.
I brought you lunch today.
Tom won't be back until October.
Can you hold the door for me?
Someone approached the door.
Tom wanted to forget Mary.
Tom ran to the fire to see what was there.
And here you are!
You don't have to hurt like that.
He can do that.
They sing.
I'm afraid it will rain this evening.
She never kept her word.
The computer is broken.
If you have any problems, call.
They are married.
Are you at home?
I want to look rich.
My brain is fried!
I missed you so much!
We are expecting guests this evening.
We both hate it.
Don't forget the old log.
I speak French.
I'm not going to tell anyone, don't worry.
Someone has stolen my passport.
Are you coming to Montreal this weekend?
Why?
I'll come and help you.
You should continue working in a place like this.
He is a monster.
Two for one is better than one.
Tom was stung by a tick-borne infection.
I think Tom has me in his sights.
I'm not interested in this.
A fire will be lit in the courtyard.
Kiss her head.
This is stinking!
I have already forgotten.
You should be stopped.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
Sami touches my things.
You should talk to Tom.
Write it in French.
Something has happened.
Stay with me.
Speak with caution.
Tom doesn't like to wait until he's found to do something.
I talked to Tom.
Tom was murdered.
Remember that!
Please don't die.
Tom is going to be a third on October 20.
Sami is a very nice person.
Are you listening to me right now?
Take a breath!
She didn't know the kids.
I think Tom is brave.
You have a very nice smile.
Who is this book for?
I'm pretty sure that Tom loves Mary.
Let him go.
This car is new.
Your day has come!
They're laughing at you.
Look ahead of you.
What happened then?
She stopped talking.
I want you to go with Tom.
The child with the flu was being closely watched by the doctors.
What did he say?
Say what you want, I won't believe you.
There is no life without water.
You are so beautiful.
Are you ready?
We like to learn music.
Get out of here!
My father doesn't know her.
People here speak French.
Get the warrant.
Tom hopes to be back by the end of October.
Could you leave the door open?
The eagle!
Be careful how you walk.
Tom is a lawyer, isn't he?
You danced.
Somebody hurt Tom.
I hope no one has seen you come here.
He speaks English well.
Tom is out of his mind.
You are both witches.
Are you open?
Thank you for your kindness.
Is that wine?
Have a good day.
We should think of the worst that could happen.
Are you rich?
Tom fell asleep.
I went to school with him.
I want you to work with them.
Open it up.
I hate you!
Tom and Mary went to see him.
He's a good writer.
Where is your aunt?
Tom asked for a large plate.
She is blind.
I'm all dressed up.
There was no one inside.
I feel like I'm alone these days.
I wish you a day of sunshine and flowers in bloom.
I was unlucky.
I'm going to assume that's not true.
Stay with me.
What team do you all like?
He was being bullied.
What then?
I will dream of you.
Bring examples.
Anyone can see us.
What do you feed your dog?
Look at what you're eating.
We read English.
I am mad at you.
My computer is broken.
Just take me home.
Let me finish, or I'll call the police!
Look closely!
A sheep always laughs at a goat.
Both Tom and I want to go.
Thank you for your concern.
Sit down on the side.
Tom said there was no one there.
She got up.
He is at home today.
Please read it again.
Do you mind if I ask you a question that doesn't matter?
Tom started to talk.
Can you please wait a minute?
Let me remind you of something.
I've tried to do that twice.
Can you help me?
Can you keep up?
I'll tell you a secret.
I can teach you how to read.
You're too hard on yourself!
Somebody has to do something.
Tom is getting ready for the party.
Sami didn't receive the last message.
Where are you?
I'll get you if you tell me sooner.
Only the elderly think they are right.
Have you read this?
I'll read to you on Monday.
No, I don't know your brother.
I'm not running.
What's happening now?
Is that it?
Are you making fun of me?
I didn't wash your car.
I was born in Boston.
Dinner is ready.
I released the animals from their cages.
I must know them.
Do you want something to drink?
You are all happy.
If you ask me, it's a waste of time.
Tom thought Mary would do that.
The one who fights may lose, but the one who does not fight has already lost.
You are all Americans.
Someone has been sleeping here.
Take this away.
You keep fighting.
It is snowing.
Will you study today?
You refused to pay.
Did he use it?
I haven't said anything yet.
We were friends.
I wrote a letter for you.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Here's the word.
Someone is following you.
Look in front of you.
I like to read books.
I'm glad you won.
Be careful.
How many of these do you need?
Look at us!
I like to travel.
Tom and I were good friends.
Excuse me. Where are the eggs?
Stay in there.
My uncle comes to Boston every weekend to see Mary.
Tom made a mistake.
Are you ashamed?
Tom put his feet on the ground.
Thank you very much.
You can't go in like that.
How beautiful you are!
He looked for me.
I just want to get married.
I like to read.
Write it in French.
Will you do this for me?
I heard Tom's call.
Tom lives near the beach, but he can't swim.
I don't know how much it will cost.
Suck the other ear.
You are lucky you didn't get hurt.
My friend doesn't know.
Aren't you from here?
Are you waiting for someone?
Tom is being watched.
Tom turned to Mary.
Please read this book.
We'll wait for you here.
Tom is confused.
Tom is very confused.
I told the truth.
Do you have a dog?
Are you ready?
Are you looking for food?
Stop whining!
Tom couldn't trust Mary.
Someone must have seen you.
We are hungry.
The matter is resolved!
Everyone blames you.
Answer me with a word.
Tom is taking off his clothes.
We must save him immediately.
We'll sell the others.
You must have eaten a lot.
I'm trying to come up with another plan.
How much chocolate did you eat?
How is Tom?
This has to stop.
Tom is sick.
Did someone hit Tom?
Tom is attracted to Mary.
What are you all afraid of?
I've already been invited by one.
Bring food.
What is your favorite author?
The dog is cold.
Are you waiting for Tom?
I wish them a year of peace and prosperity.
The conversation stopped.
He confessed again.
You are lucky.
You can change this if you want.
Don't stop following me.
Tom only wants a cup of tea.
Try to seduce Tom.
Please forgive me!
How I miss you!
You should just call Jean.
I think you're wrong.
Stop yelling!
You should hire someone.
Tom hated Mary.
Have you read this?
I'm very happy about your wedding.
I miss Tom.
I hope nothing happened to him.
Follow your own path.
A word like "family" has 3 syllables.
You were in Boston.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
I have something to give you.
Make two mistakes.
He likes to be rude.
Tom can rest as much as he wants.
Sami was reading a message to Layla.
His hat is a red-and-white.
I know I can count on you.
Who are you?
Shut up Tom!
Welcome to Canada!
A bird passes over a tree only once.
They live there.
Someone is talking.
I should be there early.
I'll come and help you.
They're all outside.
You should try this on your own.
Keep her warm.
Did you eat enough?
You are idiots.
I know you're here, Tom.
She hid her secrets.
Why are you crying?
It's not a bad thing to do.
Call me Tom.
What are you going to do here?
If you change, you'll smell the next batch.
Be careful.
Someone made a mistake.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Two beers, please.
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
I can't wait to see you.
Stop laughing at me.
I went to buy something to eat.
Tom will also be attending the party.
Come to my room.
Tom didn't come back.
Do you remember?
Stop fighting each other.
Dad always wanted Tom to go out with you.
Speak up !
Tom wants Mary.
Tom is a very smart guy.
Tom is pissed off.
I've seen Tom for three days.
Are you brothers?
I'm out of words.
I don't like you anymore.
Don't loan Tom a lot of money.
I want to know who's coming with us.
Senior leaders have met to the brink of a dead end.
Have you already answered?
Tom lived with his parents in Australia.
I have a tooth, don't I?
Where is your sister?
Someone is waiting for you.
Show me your true face.
He is good.
I was in his room.
You're a fish.
Tom is pissed.
You'll have my car.
Tom washed with cold water.
He was a very scared man, and they kept on fucking him.
What do you call yourself?
Have you read everything?
Sami speaks with his hands.
I believed everything they told us.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
Tom is very quiet.
Tom is all mine.
Are you going to leave me?
Did you brush your teeth?
I think he's lost his mind.
Do you want eggs?
Please remember to say hello to your family.
Tom didn't leave Mary.
Can I see what's there, please?
Do you like dogs?
Don't go near that place.
The ground was covered with blood.
I know I can count on you.
He is a Kabyle.
Tom can't come today.
Where will we eat?
Your day will come.
Mr. White was elected as a director.
You're too old for him.
You are going fast.
They smiled.
Somebody has to do something.
What is your philosophy?
Put on your coat. It's cold outside.
Who hacked my computer?
Be yourself.
I really love you.
You'll have to wait.
I don't want to leave you here alone.
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
Tom didn't go to the school Mary went to.
Tom had no choice but to stay.
Brush your teeth before you go to bed!
Please!
Please shut it down.
Tom is determined to go alone.
I am starting a new life.
The ceremony took place on October 20, 2013.
Aren't you hungry?
I think it's a beautiful building.
I need to know someone.
Are you stupid?
Tom read carefully.
Please let me have your car.
Are they clean?
She sat there in silence.
Somebody has to do it.
Are you Swedish?
I live in Australia.
I think Tom is a liar.
You are joking.
Do you know how to swim?
I've been in Boston for three months.
He didn't talk about it.
I just need someone's help.
A pretty girl is a pretty girl.
The car stopped.
Choose carefully.
Tom was released from prison in October.
I know about that.
I understand your reasons.
Why are you crying?
We want to get to know you.
You should eat.
The leaves are growing into a trunk.
Everyone is tired.
Have you read it yet?
Do you want me to go with you?
I never saw him again.
Is Tom from Australia?
Have you ever cycled to school?
Tom seems to have found something.
Stop the car!
Don't worry about it.
Is he Japu's son?
This program is good.
When will you consider me your friend?
Can someone help me?
What do you want from Tom?
Please call her on the phone.
Is everyone there?
How old were you when you went to live in Boston?
I hope no one saw you come this far.
What did Tom cry for?
Are you feeling all right?
We're ready to eat now.
I don't think I like you.
What a joke!
We left on October 20.
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Tell him that.
You're in time.
Please don't be rude to me.
I did that.
Tom and the other farmers are hoping for rain.
They all love you.
Tom is not our son.
He found you crying.
Somebody has to stop you.
It is the 20th of October.
Tom was the one who told me the story.
Are you ready?
Put the paper in the bag.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Tom told me he saw someone who gave Mary a coat.
Stop crying!
I was a little bit out of luck.
You're too tall for me.
My mother made me a new dress.
Are you lucky?
I lost my mind.
They know the truth.
I hope you're not angry.
I read ten books this month.
I know there's something I'm forgetting.
We built it.
Tom shook his hand.
Are you breathing something?
She swims well.
They were surprised.
Did Moses really hear God speak?
She is dead.
No one is helping us.
Go now.
He ate everything.
Hold your hat!
Take this one.
Tom outdid everyone else.
We got married in October.
Tom called me.
You should eat.
Tom is not dead.
Someone was killed.
His idea is better than yours.
Does he have a sister?
Don't come near me.
Watch your ears.
Is it hot outside?
Please wait.
You seem to like this.
I've been thinking about that all day.
He was very careful.
Have you ever been to Tibet?
Shut the door, open the door!
She is walking.
I haven't studied French in over thirteen years.
You shouldn't make a phone call at this time of the day.
Do you live here?
Do you know what you've done?
I believe you.
Close your book.
Why don't you shut up? The place is empty.
They look very good on me.
Stop the teaching!
This place is full of monsters.
Did you eat your lunch?
Go with care.
My life is in your hands.
The race will start on October 20th.
Do you still eat meat?
Just talk to them.
They all speak French.
I miss you so much.
Tom tried to persuade Mary.
Tom told me you weren't married.
I am your father.
What do these people do?
If you had listened to me, this would not have happened.
Open my eyes.
What's new?
Are you tired?
He has a watch.
Get out of here!
So why are you here?
Tom nearly drowned.
No one knows what tomorrow will bring.
I couldn't do this without your help.
I like life.
Have you seen anyone here?
What plan have we prepared?
There are demons.
You told the dog to sit down, didn't you?
Reading and writing in Kabyle became a habit for us.
You smiled.
It was a very difficult time.
You seem nervous.
Both Tom and Mary don't speak French well.
I'm going to ask for some more letters.
There is someone waiting.
They all laughed.
I'd like red wine, please.
He's out of his mind.
Tom can't eat for himself.
Tom wanted help from us.
I was in my cell.
I sold computers.
The syntax can vary greatly in languages.
I'm about to go to Boston with Tom and Mary.
I don't like Tom that much.
They're all gone.
Do you need some help, my friend?
There are three brothers.
They are very friendly.
I'm not your friend.
Tom can show Mary.
Tom is a geek.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
You can take your money back if you want.
They left early.
Keep your ears open!
Tom was stunned by Mary.
Mary is upset.
Are you at home?
Let me know when you'll call me back.
I love you just the way you are.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Are you guys gay?
Someone could get hurt.
None of these books are useful.
Why are you angry?
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom is better than Mary at playing the piano.
Tom says he's fine.
He has sent them to you.
It is worth it.
You are a liar.
Do you think I'll live?
Tom has lost his temper.
He is not the same as before.
You can eat as much as you want today.
Will they come again?
We played a game.
Look behind you.
I'm here for you.
I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you.
Sami has a lunch break.
Do you think anyone can see me?
I have nothing to say.
Tom has been joking on the phone for an hour.
You are beautiful.
Tom was angry as he was picking up the papers.
I hate Tom.
No one looked.
Tom told me not to go there alone.
What do you want to do?
Come and see me.
You should read this.
Are you two thieves?
Sami was singing.
Tom and Mary are farmers.
Please buy it.
I don't like to eat where people smoke.
I don't think Tom needs any help.
Write to me!
Kill me.
He runs.
Have you spoken to your wife?
Why are they so afraid?
I'm still in Australia, but I'll be back home the day after tomorrow.
Tom opened a beer can.
I like Australia.
Give him a kiss.
I'm going to leave.
Tom is drunk.
They stopped.
You are on your own.
The children will return to school tomorrow.
He didn't go in or out.
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Is there anyone there?
There is no choice we should be ashamed of.
Someone is jealous of Tom.
Tom and Mary met last week.
You had better cut your hair.
Who do you think stole your car?
I'm very interested in this news.
I like to read books.
Woe to you, you whore!
Please call if you have any questions.
You are idiots!
I always stay inside the bar.
You are a problem.
I made the call.
To each his own.
You are all idiots!
I'm going to Boston in October.
Did you eat well?
Stay with me.
Her work is better than mine.
The story is repeated.
Beer is going to make me rich.
Take a bow if you've spoken to me before.
I ate the caucuses.
The food is good for you.
Are you drunk?
Does Tom charge you a lot?
Are you finished?
Do you think I should do that?
Do you like dogs?
It's a race against time.
I have a fever.
She asked them if they had any tea.
We have achieved great success by taking some risks.
I was hurt in their marriage.
The birds like water.
He wants us to play a game.
I don't think Tom would like Boston.
I don't know what I was expecting.
Please come back.
You are tired.
I'm surprised to see you.
Don't forget your money.
Does everyone hear that?
Things are getting ugly.
Tom became very inactive.
Ahmad is a musician.
Why are you washing your hands?
I'll take the most expensive.
We both hated it.
Tom told Mary that he planned to stay in Boston until October.
Listen to this!
Do you know when the movie "Star Trek" will start?
Sami got lost in the forest.
I did nothing.
Stay still and don't move.
Do something with your health.
Find another one.
I understand your reasons.
Sami is hardworking.
They're making fun of you.
Tom became a jerk.
Tom is a good writer.
Don't hit him in the head.
He came back at six.
This is a bee.
We are cutting down.
Tell him tomorrow.
They helped us.
Does Tom visit you often?
I feel old again.
Are you teachers?
I'm afraid we have a problem.
Tom and Mary seem to be doing this on their own.
Someone opened the door.
Get up on your feet!
I want to go swimming tomorrow.
Tom danced.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
If you don't want to do it, don't have to!
He isn't there.
Bring me some milk, too.
The moon has already bloomed.
You fools!
Can you please wait a minute?
He is very upset.
It's your turn!
Take this.
They stopped.
I think you're wrong.
They have a lot of money.
Tell me the truth.
I speak good Greek.
You went to school yesterday.
Do you have a home in Australia?
Tom went to have lunch with Mary.
Tom is a cool guy, isn't he?
Why don't you read to someone?
Someone has stolen my suitcase.
Someone is watching you.
Tom sent me a letter.
Take this.
I think we're all here.
We won't let you.
Was everyone smiling?
Tom is there.
I like French.
I walked away.
Birds are flying.
Suck it up!
Your work is very hard.
Tom called Mary to confirm her wish.
Let the water run.
Sami doesn't like Layla to be like this.
Tell me about Turks in Germany.
Tom started to talk.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
I am listening to music.
What do you call your dog?
Our dog is black.
Tom can see.
Who are you talking to?
I have two Canadian friends.
I want to know who read it.
That's it!
It was just an accident.
Tom has been in Australia since October.
Can you find him?
I saw a bear.
Tom was worried.
Do you want to try it?
He died on October 20 in Boston.
Stay here.
I thought someone had died.
I'm going to Boston in November.
I think Tom and Mary are lost.
What did you see in Boston?
We were worried about you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
A rooster, please.
Someone took my place.
You were obviously wrong.
Let's look at this carefully.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
I don't like red wine, so I don't eat it all the time.
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
Did something happen?
It is a lemon.
I found someone to help me do that.
Just talk to them.
Look behind you.
You are a problem.
We were studying.
Please call him.
Are you drinking?
Tom understood French, but he had a problem speaking it.
I know the way.
Someone will see us.
Are we finished?
There you go!
Are you Ukrainian?
He refused to believe them.
This is Tom's wife.
To the school.
They went to Boston on October 20.
Why did you come to me?
So what?
I don't eat much fruit.
You are my hero, Sami.
Don't let him get away with it! His day will come!
Tom repeated the word many times.
Are you happy?
Hunger does not make bread.
Who will pay for this?
Let's try something.
I could have forgotten you.
Are you finished?
I want to marry her, but I haven't made up my mind yet.
I'm sure I can handle it.
Thank you.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
You are all invited.
Please leave.
Do you want to be alone for the rest of your life?
Open your books!
I'm learning French.
He is as strong as a horse.
Clean your room.
Who is against it?
My mother is dead.
I like this one. I'll take it.
Stop complaining!
No one paid attention.
Turn left!
I don't want you to understand.
I hope you're right.
Don't be afraid of the dark.
We hope you'll come in large numbers.
Religion has no future.
He is French.
Tom is in Australia.
Some newlyweds never marry their wives.
Is someone dead?
Do you have any answers?
Have you read this book?
Tom's room isn't very big.
Tom was going to leave Mary.
Stop laughing at me.
Let me go!
Are you ready?
I forgot my keys.
Please stay away.
Someone was talking.
Someone else has done it before.
Jim kept himself from being in a fight.
Get out of here!
This gift is for you.
Tom and Mary danced.
Let me see what you wrote.
Tom may be speaking French.
They are birds.
I love my son.
Ddayxa likes to eat.
Somebody has to stop Tom.
Did you attend Tom's concert?
Stop crying.
Tom is angry at Mary.
Is it hot?
Please don't die.
They have a lot of money.
Nature has created languages that man cannot learn all.
Sami's car doesn't stop here.
How many Canadians work here?
Please talk a little.
How good!
I can say something.
Hundreds of people eat here every day.
Look behind you.
Do you remember what Tom said?
We are going!
Tom seemed to be worried.
I don't want to leave you.
We met on October 20th last year.
Will you sing?
My father's and grandfather's donkey has been caught in the fire!
I heard someone screaming.
Keep writing.
Tom came into my house.
Are you Russian?
I've never been a fan of the Bible.
I am being trained.
Who swam?
I am not a student.
Get out of here!
I like math.
Why would Tom want me to help him?
Is there someone else here?
Is that a good sign, Tom, or what?
Tom ate with a spoon.
Someone tried to kill you.
What time did Tom leave?
Do you write French?
Tom had to stay, he had no other choice.
What do you want?
I'm glad to be back.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
Have you ever worked with them?
I want you to work with them.
He went to bed early yesterday.
Why did the Nazi say: "A foreign Nazi is a thief"?
Nothing has changed.
If you need help, call me.
Be ready for a move.
Tom spoke up.
It's hard to choose between the trash and the pot.
You are a dog.
Tom cooked the potatoes.
He returned to the mountains of Kabylia.
They are cold.
He is beautiful!
Someone wants to hurt you.
Where were you in October?
What happened then?
Tom tried to name Mary.
Did anyone call you yesterday?
It's not all right.
"I've been told everything", Tom said, "but I've never really noticed".
He doesn't have the money to pay the rent.
Are you Chinese?
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
Is it okay if I visit you today?
My parents have just arrived at the station.
Someone has stolen my bag.
Where is your mother?
Are you drinking?
Put it on the floor.
The birds are singing.
Why does Tom want to stop?
Help me to work.
I'm going swimming tomorrow.
Have you eaten anything?
It's already too late.
Have you read it yet?
Is something bothering you?
I heard people speaking French on the bus.
There is no god.
There is someone else in my room.
Sami's car is not running.
Help me to get out.
I wonder.
Can you fix this?
Someone has bought something.
She was sick.
Nothing will change.
I left Australia three years ago and never returned.
Don't bother!
You are crazy.
I need you here.
Somebody has to do something.
My life is in your hands.
Do it
Are you a witch?
We need help.
Please listen.
Aren't you coming to see me?
Did my friend surprise you?
There is little milk in the jar.
It hurts as much as it hurts.
I saw a photo with Tom.
I'll stay home when they come next time.
I am sorry for your loss.
Is there someone you want to see?
Well, God forbid the green eggs you hatched didn't hatch! They might have hatched as fleas!
I don't know Tom very well.
You should go home.
He's not there.
Either there is one now or there has already been one.
Children learn by example.
Tom seems to be very nice.
Are you going swimming tonight?
We arrived in Osaka the day before yesterday.
Please don't go and read what this creature says!
Everyone is happy.
I want a lot of money.
Do you know where he was born?
I'm glad to see you, too.
What are you reading?
Tom asked someone to make him something to eat.
Tom is a coward.
Tom likes to sing.
You have spoken.
I'm out of words.
He played.
Tom was lucky that Mary wasn't there with him.
My job is cleaning.
This Web site contains a summary in the Kabylie language with lessons and examples and a link.
I'm going to do it.
Tom told you he'd go back to his hometown.
You are a coward.
Are you all right?
Did someone hurt Tom?
Clean the mirror.
What did you do today?
Tom and I talked about many different things.
What are you doing?
He is a thief.
Let's play this game.
Why don't you visit me sometime?
Are they new?
It didn't help.
Stop it!
He wants another cup of coffee.
He put a needle in his eye.
Tom will listen.
It looks like I've arrived too early.
Your father will be pleased to see you back as soon as possible.
You'll find someone who left it there.
There's someone outside.
Someone might hear you.
Is that true?
Tom hopes to see you in October.
I was hoping you would show me how to do that.
Do you speak Latin?
I think there is someone in the front room.
Please answer.
Please don't forget to sign the letter.
Are you an artist?
I know your language.
I will never forgive you.
Why do you want this so much?
Tom always seems to be successful.
Someone has already invited me.
You have heard.
Your time has come!
You deceived me.
Mr. West called while you were out.
I haven't changed. You have.
Is that so?
During the day they are frolicking; at night they are fighting. What is it, what is it? It is the doorbell.
They all love sweets.
How has your weekend been so far?
Tom is dancing.
We want to dance.
I worked for a week in one afternoon.
Where did the money go?
They all came to me!
I need to talk to someone.
I want to have someone to talk to.
I'm from Japan.
You are beautiful.
I don't think you should do that.
I'm mad at Tom.
Tom has been busy for Mary.
See you later, Tom.
I can't go swimming with you tomorrow.
You're not the only one that Tom has deceived.
Tom was jealous of Mary.
You can eat now.
Run to Tom.
Someone was already here.
What are you doing?
Try these.
Today is hard.
Tom kissed Mary.
Do you want me to read it to you?
Sami likes to do that.
I know we're not brave enough for this.
Something is different.
She takes her medicine every hour.
I wish Tom hadn't told me to do that.
I won't forget it at all.
She no longer laughs at me.
Tom has spoken.
I can't help Tom today.
I met her once on this road.
I'm bored with it.
What is it?
Stop there.
In fact, he loves her too.
I'm afraid for you.
Mary is a good girl, but she talks a lot.
Did you buy it in Boston?
These phrases are not our own. They are the same as those we hear from our elders!
Mary is very beautiful, but not very smart.
I might go to Boston in October.
I sincerely hope so.
Bring some milk, too.
Sami traveled through Egypt by car.
I want to buy a house in Australia and stay for a year.
How much do you trust him?
I can't see very well.
Hello to all of you!
In our house, the tradition is that everyone washes their own clothes.
Take this one.
I have to read the book.
I have some work to do.
Get out of here!
You can borrow one.
I already told you that I didn't do that.
Sami has never considered himself a Christian.
The two mountains are a mountain, and the one mountain is a hill, called the Cretaceous.
Tom told me a story.
I'll never leave you, Tom.
Do you think anyone could see me?
Are you finished?
I returned from Boston on October 20th.
You can't answer either.
Someone is lying.
Eat this cab. It will help you sleep.
I'm afraid I'll forget your name.
Tom doesn't care who looks at him.
Mary made a Halloween costume for the children.
I asked Tom to clean the room.
Listen, Tom can't see you're here.
I can't do that for you now.
This is what you asked for.
Are you lying to me?
Somebody is listening.
Who is from Kyoto?
Why didn't you tell me what happened last night?
I can swim.
You are a panda.
I saw someone give Tom a hat.
Someone is climbing the stairs.
Can they hear outside?
Tom's room isn't very big.
Tom did as Mary said.
Try to clean it.
Maybe we should tell someone.
Spring has come.
I don't know how long I'll be gone.
I know you.
The party is over.
Your mother eats slowly.
It's good to tell the truth.
You ate too much.
You are being used.
From your heart?
Tom explained it.
I'll call you this evening.
Did Tom really say that he thought he would stay in Australia?
Tom visited Australia last summer.
Are you crazy?
He's here to kiss me.
Tom may be in Australia by October.
I like snow.
Are you guys that crazy?
Stay closed!
Keep your head down!
Who are you people?
Remember that.
You're not going to die soon.
They all think so.
Come in here.
My feet are swollen.
Sami asked Layla to make him a present.
Is that not true?
Tell him that.
You will suffer.
Someone was following us.
I also left.
You can now consider Layla your aunt.
Someone is eating our poison.
Are you a lawyer?
Many countries have laws against smoking.
Will he be back?
The room is rented.
I might be able to go to Boston in October.
You were in Boston.
What is it?
I walked alone.
You are hot.
We have until October to finish our project.
Hello, my sweet.
I know I can't win.
You'll be all right.
I'll meet you there in five minutes.
Tom and I were never close friends.
I'm going to buy four tickets.
I want to be a farmer.
Please come over here.
It is better to learn to be quiet.
Someone answered.
Questions will be asked of the reader, and the answer given to them.
I'm an old friend of Tom's.
When should I smoke?
Is he a thief?
You are dressed in black.
I'm used to the heat.
I don't like to eat alone.
Don't you see any of this?
Tom said he wanted to do that.
I came yesterday.
Someone has to speak.
Are you rich?
Bring them something to eat.
They all speak Roman.
We'll never do that.
There is something wrong.
They didn't tell me how Tom died.
Where are you going?
When will you eat lunch?
Why don't you go outside and play?
You are making love with the stars.
Tom was found dead on October 20th.
Please finish the taxi.
Go slowly.
They have guests.
Tom deserves this.
Mary is mad at Tom.
Tom will come with you when he's finished his work.
Is this your last question?
I am unemployed.
I'm a friend of his brother.
What department do you work for?
Tom gave us a lot of food.
Six is a number.
Sami was fighting with the gymnastics teacher.
Sami won.
If you want to eat this, you can.
My father is not at home.
Tom likes to talk about golf.
What is your goal?
They don't know yet.
Tom is a bit nervous.
How wonderful he is!
Come to the house.
Stop the music.
What do they call you?
We speak French.
You sing!
I'm not doing you any harm.
Don't blame Tom for that.
Tom and Mary have a good relationship.
How many pounds did you make?
The thief threw his finger in the air and his son picked it up.
We're not on a trip right now.
They tasted.
Tom said he'd come tomorrow.
Tom was surprised by his appearance.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
You are a fool!
Tom and Mary broke up.
Tom and Mary have a similar idea.
I like their house.
You can always change.
I plan to go to Australia in October.
Tom is a man of his word.
You showed it to Tom.
Come on over here.
You are so stupid!
I like history.
Everybody lies.
Stop fooling around!
I guess you love your job.
Don't add to the garbage, at least! Damn, that's bad!
Do you have some water?
Tom died on October 20.
You are cold.
I ate it.
She writes well.
We can't build a house with one person.
Tom likes to sing.
I've always liked to swim.
Don't you remember what Tom did to Mary?
I can do it myself.
We are teachers.
There is no song.
No one knows.
I want you to quit.
Tom returned to Boston last October.
Don't open the door.
Have you done a little?
When did you buy this hat?
Did someone call you?
I want you to come right away.
Do you know?
I really started to dislike Australia.
Sami's kisses did not make Layla laugh.
Have you finished your work?
This will make you stronger.
I want you to try this.
I know you left early.
He was hungry.
You can use this dictionary.
They were shocked.
He lives!
Why do you want all this?
Sami was there.
Why didn't you go to Boston last summer?
Someone is following us.
He likes to walk.
Where is your God now?
I don't know where Tom is.
We met for the last time.
Does that make you happy?
Are you surprised to see her?
We killed the rabbi.
Tom is tired.
They are inside.
Tom can't help us.
What's the use of a car if you don't drive?
I'll be here on Monday.
Tom is angry with Mary.
Don't leave me alone.
No one can find him.
We all miss you.
I'm not interested in religious matters.
You shouldn't eat too much sweets.
You should have been careful.
My jeep is long.
You're new here, aren't you?
Get out of here.
I'm glad to see you smile.
Stop whining.
The sun is obscured by clouds.
He is good.
Tom and I spoke on the phone.
Clean your room!
We're worried about you.
Your friends are waiting for you.
I'm the one who pays all the bills.
Tom knocked on Mary's door three times.
Don't you swim?
Tom traveled to Australia.
Tom and I both want to go.
When Tom is worried, he eats.
Tom told me that he might be able to go to Boston.
Where will your friends sleep?
You guys are really smart!
Snow will destroy all the fishing grounds in all parts of the country.
He goes to school early.
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom doesn't remember Mary.
Why didn't you go to Boston last summer?
Are you a fool?
I did this for you.
I'm in a fight with my boss.
Tom wanted to stop Mary.
This is my opinion, not yours.
Do you know which room the meeting will be in?
Last year I visited Dubrovnik.
I'm sure there's someone in the next room.
Australia is not a paradise.
Tom and Mary are already married.
Tom is a Christian.
What book are you reading?
Tom will forget Mary.
I learned to speak.
I told Tom I wanted to be in Australia for three more weeks.
Both Tom and Mary didn't want to do that.
I had some trouble getting a taxi.
Can I?
My head hurts.
This is the way to go.
Now I need help.
Can I talk to you alone?
The project is finished.
The woman you were talking to is my sister.
I could be stopped by someone.
Tom got up.
Tom fell down.
You're not used to drinking a lot of water.
Hurry up!
Stop it !
The wings fell off.
Do you think I am?
At night, it snowed and was cold.
Tom doesn't care about Mary.
Read it to me!
You should learn English.
We all love him.
Can you find it?
Do you believe in ghosts?
Shut up!
I'm Tom's mother.
There's nothing there.
What's in your heart is on your face.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Do you like Germany?
Tom said he liked it very much.
Don't you know that Tom has decided to go to Boston with Mary?
I haven't smoked in a long time.
Find out what it is!
Please use a tray!
There is no turning back.
Sami and Layla are looking at each other.
I'm happy for you.
There must be someone who can stop you.
Wait, you are crazy!
How long will it take Tom to get to Boston?
Children love to play hide and seek.
You have a book in your hand.
Maybe someone wants it.
Some of the stories by Hans Christian Andersen have been translated into Kazakh.
I don't have any children.
What then?
Just like my new car.
Tom is in bad shape.
Tom is Irish.
Do you have a dog?
Don't tell anyone about it.
Change your clothes!
Do you have friends?
Do you remember?
Let the water run.
Tom has cleared the snow.
Let Tom go.
I just talked to him.
There you go!
You may have done this with us.
Let's sleep on it.
He lost his dignity.
You should eat breakfast every day.
Listen to this!
Someone just got sick.
We didn't know it was true.
Ali Ideflawen is a famous Kabyle singer.
She is tired.
I visited Boston the other day.
I'll call you today.
You're married to Tom.
Don't look at it.
Do you know where he was born?
Tom is a smartass.
My mother was sick for two days.
Don't forget to tell Tom he has to do that.
Are you sick?
Please find it.
Tom doesn't get along with Mary.
They were not friends.
I like to walk alone.
What time do you eat?
Don't worry. It's easy.
Is there anyone you'd like to help?
What are we waiting for?
Tom has a secret.
Your computer won't start!
Someone has to speak.
Is something bothering you?
Tom has a black car.
Have you checked them?
Someone is looking at you.
Fish, please.
I want to know what you like to eat.
It was a beautiful day.
Sami wants to stay home.
Are you alone?
No one was killed.
Give me your eye!
Did you eat dinner or not?
Where did he go?
Tom was hired in October.
Tom has a big shirt on.
"So you believe him?" "Absolutely not!"
Tom looks rich.
The silent one agrees.
He has saved you twice.
You are right.
Please stand up.
Tell her the truth.
You are wrong.
He is good.
It's better for you to cut your hair.
Give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.
This is obviously a mistake.
I've never forgotten about you.
I am a human being.
Have you seen the new movie?
They're all dead.
Say it another way.
Where is the pen?
I don't eat fruit.
What will you eat tomorrow?
When is Tom coming back from Boston?
He shouted at me.
Give it to whomever you want.
Tom took Mary's place.
She took my hand.
Why can't we play tennis today?
Have you read?
He was shocked.
You shouldn't work.
Did you arrest Tom?
I want to eat here this evening.
Did you see the star?
Do you sing in French?
Your older sister will meet you.
Two beers, please.
You're better than Tom.
Tom threw me the apple.
A little bird sits on a lampshade.
I am a foreigner.
Someone has poisoned us.
Everything is where it's supposed to be.
From the heart?
Do you have daughters?
He is a boy who follows the advice of his parents and teachers.
Hello again!
You have a lot of faces.
Are you worried about me?
If you want, you can.
Switzerland is a country of railway roads.
Arabic is not my language, I am Kabyle.
Are you crazy?
October was difficult.
Have you read this?
Perhaps not.
There was someone inside.
I don't care if you kissed Tom or not.
I want a book.
Open the door.
Tom and I went to Boston to see Mary.
Tom is your father.
Tom was the first to pass the test.
This time it's different.
I'm sorry about that.
It's raining.
He went to visit her when she lived in London.
There is someone else coming now.
I want you to work with them.
October is a busy month.
We all miss you.
I have to study.
Take Tom home with you.
I eat here.
The truth is cruel.
I ate.
I didn't stay in Boston for long.
What do you want from us?
Tom wants to marry Mary.
Tom can't drive.
Sami knows where I live.
Why does Tom need my help?
I shouldn't have kissed Tom.
You didn't help me.
I won't be eating at home tonight.
Look at her.
You are happy.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
He picked up a bag and went straight to the market.
Hold this.
What time will you leave?
Sami is angry with Layla.
Why are you crying?
You two! You're supposed to wear a wig! I don't see!
The walls came down, and people rushed to their homes.
They were all drunk.
The fire broke out at night.
Why are you sitting alone?
I like old people.
You have to try.
Take your hand off me.
We didn't leave you.
Swimming is good for your health.
France is a republic.
You're ashamed of yourselves.
Just wait here.
Tom is a bit of a wild card.
Mary built it.
Tom and Mary are smiling.
Someone knocked on the door.
Sami is used to eating in a restaurant.
You'll have a little sister.
Tom is wrong.
She lost everything she had.
Behind you.
Who are they for?
Tom took it.
Tom said he knew who did it.
Tom is rich.
I'm not talking about this with her.
Who knows what it is.
What's your friend's name?
I told you it would work.
You are crazy.
You are blinded by love.
Football is a big deal in this country.
I'm not going.
I'm washing my clothes.
They're moving fast!
Ian, you're in the clear.
Don't underestimate your work.
Stop them.
If I remember correctly, Tom's birthday is October 20th.
Keep your heads up!
Are you blind?
Eat all you want.
How long do we have to wait?
Life is beautiful.
It is raining.
It is beautiful!
Why didn't you take him home?
Tom wants to die.
This translation is completely wrong.
Did you miss something?
You are always healthy.
Did you blame Tom?
Don't worry about it.
You seem to be giving me a lot of trouble.
They were all outside.
What do you want from Tom?
Why do you want all these?
Did you notice that I was speaking Arabic?
If Tom can't do it, no one can.
I really need to eat something.
I've missed a lot of rounds in my life.
Are you hungry?
They have a problem.
Put your clothes on!
Tom is getting along.
Since when has Tom been learning French?
I play the guitar.
Why not?
I'll ask Tom to do that.
Did you find anything?
I realized that Tom really loved me.
I like to sleep.
Tom and Mary have the same idea.
We all hate you.
Do you know Tom's password?
You can help Tom get home this evening.
We know you didn't kill Tom.
Sami was in Tahiti.
Try to convince Tom to do this.
Tell me who you are!
No one knows why.
Is that love?
Are you sure?
Tom can see Mary.
One, two, three, go!
Are you okay?
I heard someone talking.
Tom thought I was Mary.
Which boy?
We don't have a book.
How many eggs do you eat a week?
Tell Tom what you want.
Someone is talking.
Have you read this?
I'm expecting a call this morning.
What does all this mean?
You must follow the rules.
Do good to those who hate you.
What do you want?
Stop fooling around.
It's really hot.
I need someone to talk to.
Say the word 'ahhh'.
I don't like Tom.
Let me see what you wrote.
Keep on laughing.
I read the paper carefully.
We need more weapons.
You're lucky to have come.
Is there anyone you'd like to see?
Come with me.
Be yourself.
You have plenty of time.
Well, I just said that: they've always been losers.
Are you Canadians?
I hope to do it again.
There is no garage in Tom's house.
Somebody should speak.
I respect you.
October 20th is a busy day.
Then it started to rain heavily.
Tom drove faster than Mary.
Write your name.
Someone was killed.
No one said anything.
You can return your money if you want.
I disagree with you on this matter.
It's our car.
I believe you.
Do as you like.
I'm tired of watching TV.
She didn't eat the carrot.
Could you help me again?
They're all crying.
Your luck is equal to your suffering.
Which tooth hurt you?
Please come today if you're hungry.
Tom got up.
How many gluten did you eat?
May I see the list, please?
Be careful!
Tom tried to save Mary.
Tom regretted that they wanted to do it.
You need someone like me.
Tom is your father.
I don't think I like this.
Are you tired?
Take it all off.
Has Tom been drinking?
Sami saw Layla come out of Walmart.
What are you going to do with that?
I didn't read it right.
Who invited you to the wedding?
Tom kissed Mary.
They are scared.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
The pen you are holding is now mine.
What were you reading to her?
Tom and I are going to be neighbors.
How long are you going to stay in Boston?
Tom likes French.
He stayed at home.
Leave that to you.
What are you trying to tell me?
A year of snow is a year of wheat.
It snows, even though it's cold.
Hold it up!
I have to find a way out of here.
He went to the bar to get some beers.
I think Tom is much older than I am.
Read it yourself.
Do we have one?
Please be quiet.
Sami believed his mother.
I can't do otherwise.
Hokkaido is located in northern Japan.
Tom was born in Australia.
They are waiting.
Do you hear what they are saying?
I am with child.
Who told you that Tom would be here?
Can you drive us?
How will they know?
He saw me yesterday.
Give Tom a hug!
Are you all right?
You look very young.
It seems that I arrived too early.
I've never tried to drive a manual.
Tom ran outside to see what happened.
Tom is the kind of man I like.
Who is the shooter?
Tom stopped at a recreation field.
Halloween is celebrated in October.
Why aren't you doing something?
Tom owed me a lot of money.
Are you new?
Get in there!
The cat is in the nest.
You work a lot.
Someone came to our house.
My husband is a good man.
Tom is upset about the reason.
Tom said he had never heard Mary sing.
It looks like I'm asleep.
Tom is going to Boston in October.
I could never love him as much as I love you.
Do they speak French?
Do you have a house in Australia?
Leave them alone.
Tom is breathing.
Tom was freed from his guilt.
I like to swim.
Someone has slept on this bed.
You have one letter and one letter.
Mary and Tom want to buy a house.
Tom told me he saw someone give Mary a kiss.
I like apples.
I went to a Halloween party.
Who did they talk to?
We were wrong.
I believe you.
I'm a resident here in Australia.
I know everything.
I'm cold.
Did you read it?
He is dead.
Tom got home three hours later.
Tom let his dogs run free.
I love you very much.
Come home early!
Tom went into the kitchen.
You are dead.
Obviously, they didn't read us.
The apples are big.
I'm a little nervous.
They won.
It is easy to use.
You have no heart.
Stay where you are.
What a jerk!
Someone has to do it.
If I needed to, I would tell you.
I wrote a poem, do you want me to read it to you?
Can you help me, please?
Did she use them?
Thank you for telling us that.
This is my brother's.
They are all dead.
Is that Tom?
Learn it!
We need a car.
I won't eat fish without it.
Please help them.
Please just tell me what's going on.
Tom is scared.
When I come home from church, I like to have a glass of wine before I go to bed.
She built it.
I will be thirty in October.
Be reasonable.
Tom is really heavy.
Tom stood up.
It's all right!
It's time to go home.
Come here for a minute!
Sami bought two bags on Amazon.
Ah! What a shame!
Do you work?
Does Tom work for you?
The words "cross" and "crossed" come from the same root as "cross": the combination of bones that can be broken.
The rocks are very hard.
You are all confused.
They are all together.
Tom speaks French.
He stopped smoking.
Can any of us speak Spanish?
She won't eat that.
Tom didn't see her.
Send me to the party.
Which of your brothers is the oldest?
This happened once.
Why are you reading?
I keep on singing.
Everyone knew it was Tom's car.
Does she smoke?
His face has changed a lot.
You're crazy to keep working in a place like this.
I see.
Tom is crying.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
Tom changed jobs.
It is a bird.
There is no hope for his recovery.
The light has won.
Stop the whining!
I'm here as a friend.
You had better not do that while Tom is here.
These girls love you both.
Tom and I have known each other for a short time.
I saw someone give Tom a shirt.
Can you give Tom a cookie?
I think I saw Tom today.
There is nothing better than love.
I'll be in Boston until the 20th of October.
Where did you learn Italian?
Let's try something.
I'll go with you.
Stop crying.
Did you see my sister?
Layla has shaved her beard.
Look at that!
Tell them the truth.
We won.
I'm not washing your car.
I met a man whose father knew Tom.
I'm not here to hurt you.
They're after you.
Sami ran in the bush.
The smile.
Someone opened the door.
I thought we were friends.
Are you ready?
I want to eat Chinese food for dinner.
Clean your room!
You have to follow the rules.
She is a Kabyle.
We have guests this evening.
Help me out here!
The church is affiliated with the Algerian Protestant Church, the official organization of the Protestant churches.
You are a pest in the kitchen.
Somebody is cheating on Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
You don't eat too fast, do you?
Life is a journey.
Is Adam really a scientist?
I love you just the way you are.
Tom has been talking about you all day.
No one ever went there.
They left.
You should eat something.
Right here.
I asked Mr Smith.
Your sister is the smartest of all the other students.
You can't go in with that.
He looks good.
A boy stole money from his mother's purse.
Don't you know that Tom and Mary are still working?
Tom married Mary.
What time did you get here?
Look to your side.
You are reading.
Please help us.
Which one of you?
I'm just getting a feel for it.
Tom didn't know Mary loved him.
Boys and girls play together.
Your eyes are watering.
No one knows.
I'm listening to music.
I'm with Tom.
Tom didn't ask Mary to help him.
He was arrested for writing the book.
I speak your language.
The road is long, the life is short.
Tom is ready to work.
I don't want to talk about my son.
Tom and I were young when we got married.
Tom is a little shy.
I didn't see Tom at the Halloween party.
Forget about it.
We can do something.
He ran.
Tom is looking at Mary.
Sami got up to pray at dawn.
Who would be Tom's replacement?
Someone wants to send a letter.
Tom died of cancer in October.
You seem to be good at this.
They are the same age.
Nobody told me you'd be this cold.
You won't help me.
This is Rabah back.
I believe in him.
October 20 was a hot day.
Nothing is more important than the truth.
He thinks like a child.
Tom is a very smart boy.
Why did you go there?
Where are your dogs?
Tom was just sitting there in doubt.
What are you doing this weekend?
Half of your work is done.
Some of the criticism comes from religion.
Tom tried to keep his eyes open.
Keep your head down.
Our dog is black.
Your mother is eating a salad.
Mary is pissed.
Teach me something I don't know.
Are you okay?
They love their Kabyle culture.
I know you'll find a way to do that.
Someone is watching us.
I know who he is.
You wait outside.
It really broke my heart.
I want someone else.
Clean the room.
You are hiding something.
Where are you?
Didn't you know that Tom was planning to go to Boston with Mary?
Tom wanted to insult Mary.
Friendship is good when there is agreement.
You're joking, that's what I should do!
It's snowing here.
Someone forgot their hat.
Snow covers the land with mosses.
Someone has been mistaken.
Tom can do whatever he likes.
Please, don't be too quick.
Someone stole my car.
Are you mad?
You are the love of my life.
If the bread is hot, we'll make olive oil.
Aren't you tired?
Do they all like music?
I was in Boston on October 20th last year.
He ran away.
I'm not your dog.
Why are you sitting alone?
No one answered.
It is true.
Turn to the right.
I wonder why Tom turned down the job.
I don't need your work.
Naomi has come a long way since winning the prize.
Tom wasn't going to kiss Mary.
I'll see you at dinner.
Tom did a great job for us.
I wonder if he loves me.
The Amaya likes to eat the dragonfly.
Could you pass me a drink, please?
Tom is drunk.
How are you, Tom?
It's good. No one is wrong.
It's a good life.
I lost my pen.
Who went with you?
Are you ready?
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
Tom has been visiting ever since.
Are you there?
She picked up a bag and headed straight to the market.
He started to panic.

Look at that!
What a mess, Tom!

I'm not used to working outside.
You have friends, don't you?
They're all laughing.
She's been busy since yesterday.

You are very clever!
Are you a little quiet?
I didn't feel hungry at all.
Was I wrong?
Do you like to lose?
Are you guys all right?
Tom wants to return the favor.
It's going to rain tonight.

When did this start?

Someone is watching you.

I will be back tomorrow.
We saw them.
Are you hurt?
We have to do something.
You speak German well.
Talk to someone.
Let me know if there are any changes.
They laughed.
Stop making excuses.
Who is the boss?
Tom wrote me from Australia.
Tom held his hand as he opened the door.
What time will you leave?
Why do you want to help me?
I have another solution.
It's work.
Who is speaking?
What makes you sad, makes me sad.
He wants a quarter.
Tom raised his arms.
No, thank you, I don't drink coffee.
These are my books.
Tom turned around.
Someone called.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
There are no more decks!

Is there one?
There is no point in being a pariah.
Tell him tomorrow.
I heard someone crying.
Who is it?
He was up early.
Tell me how I can help you.

Don't you know how to read it?
She said to him: "I'm a fool, but I'm a fool".
My mother was in bed for two days.
Tom is hiding something.
Be strong so that you can rule.
Do you mind if I tell you what I did last summer in Boston?
The bank has invested in the wrong asset for the wrong business idea.
Mary built it.
Come on over here.
How are you, sir?
Do you have a home in Australia?
You saw yourself in the mirror.
He kissed me on the cheek.
I didn't visit Boston at all.

Keep your head up!
I'm glad to know you.
Someone has started a fire.

If you eat it, you'll die.
I want to have someone to talk to.
There is a wolf watching us.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
I didn't forget any of you.
I want you to forgive me for everything I said.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Tom, Mary, and John are all here.
They ran.
Tom plans to return on October 20th.
I heard someone moving.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since October.
Tom proposed to Mary.
No one went there.
We were both tired.
Can you split my sandwich in half?
I was ashamed.
The dog is dying.
You are beautiful.
Do not move!
I know you're brave enough to do this.
You have your word.
Have you called him yet?
The oldest is the youngest.
Someone is watching you.
Have you already done it?
Tom is here.
Answer my questions.
Someone called for you.
Tom told me that he had waited thirty minutes.
I'll try again.
The dog asked the bone that he had cut why he had not tired of grinding it: "Well, you are old, I am tired".

Who said that?
He won, I won't lose.
This was Tom's idea.
I wish no one had seen you do this.
The artistic career always ends in tragedy.
How many shoes do you wear?
They were very nice.
Just go there.
This girl is a liar.
I want to hold your hand.
Get out!
Stop the talk.
This is a joke.
Where is the nearest metro station?
I'll be back this afternoon.
We will never stop learning.
This is a gift for you.
Watch out!

I have no other choice.
They won't be back.
He walks with difficulty.
I like this movie.
Read this now.
It snowed heavily.
Be yourself.
Are you not sick?
A beer, please.
I gave you confidence.
Who stopped?
Just let me go.
I work for Tom.
You have stolen my mind!
Sami fought a lot.
I don't want to wait that long.
Someone must have started the fire.
Tom has to go to school.
It's still good to go.
Someone is coming to see us.
No one ate the carrot.
I am reading it.
Have you worked with him?
He doesn't want to leave.
Tom said he might cry.
They all laughed.
Please call me tonight.
Sami and Farid were in prison together.
We did that on October 20th.
Help Tom to get up.

I wonder if Tom is an artist.
He can speak French.
Take this one.
How much do you have?
I'm very busy right now.
Look at me!
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
It's complicated.
I'm sorry about that.
I will be in Australia until October 20th.
Are you going to Copacabana today?
If you please.

Tell them I'm here.

It's out of our hands.
Follow the path.
You guys should be ashamed of yourselves.
Jim looks like his father.
Franz Kafka, in "The Lost World", or perhaps Woody Allen, in his own words: "The stage is long, long... especially to the end".
I was so surprised to open the door!
A cup of tea, please.
I'll call you before I come.
I can't wait to see your Halloween costumes.
Tom could do that, couldn't he?
Leave it to us.
I wish I had killed Tom last October.
What is your father's recipe?
Sami saw him again.
I want to sit in the middle.
So, Tom is a good photographer?
I'm not tall.
You should be careful when crossing the border.
Tell him to come.
Today is a good day.
At first, my father was not interested.
Can I ask a question that doesn't matter?
The key is yours.
I'll tell you how to do it.
Have you seen the movie or not?
World peace.
I wish I had someone to help me do that.
It's too late!
Tom is going to Boston next month.
Have you ever been to New York?
This didn't happen.
Tom said I couldn't come in.
Do you want white or red wine?
One of them forgot her umbrella.
Can you stop the noise?
Are you home?
Don't look back at my back.

Try this one.
The government is too big.
I've followed you.

It looks like snow.
Let it be.
I think I'd like to do that.
You and I love games.
I wanted to marry Tom.

I haven't been there since October.
How did you find me?
Mr. Jones is here to see you.
I like to learn languages.
Everyone can't pronounce Tom's name.
She lied.
I think you did that without paying attention.
Would you mind sharing a tea with me, please?
It's Monday.

How do you take in your breath?

I know you're going to Boston in April.
I'm getting dressed.
Why didn't he send me a message?
I love you very much.
Are you sure you know what needs to be done?
Tom is fluent in French.

I can't see her.
I see the world differently now.
I see a book.
Have you read this?
I don't understand why you're here.
Wait until then.
I don't have a younger sister.
Tom and Mary understood why they were there.
You have two faces.
I studied history of agriculture.
Stop there!
Maybe we should tell someone.
You are completely oblivious to the danger that is coming.
I'll write to you when I'm tired.
I'm bored

You'll regret this.
He is good.

Please speak slowly.
Please come in!
Tom wanted to kiss Mary.
Tom has something for you.
We apologized.
I decided to do better this way.
I was studying French when you came in yesterday.
You just left.
She read.
You don't seem happy.
It really broke my heart.
There is no internet connection.
Follow this car.
You can come in.
Tom offered to help.
Let me out.
Someone died.
Have you been so stupid?
Give it to me.
I need to talk to someone.
I have something to give you.
Someone ate their poison.
Are you ready?
Tom missed them.
Don't go into my room without a key.
Your letter made me happy.
I'll show you how it's done.
If you want to go, go now!
Thank you, I just understood.
They are black, Tom.
You are not Japanese.
The older she is, the more she knows.
Stop singing.
Don't wait up.
Let him go.
Choose the flowers you like.
Please help me.
Someday someone will win.
Are you afraid?
Is that new?
If Mary were here she would help us.
Speak up then.
Where did I leave my mother and her mother?
Have a good day!
Tom doesn't seem very happy.
Are you in need?
I can't do what I want.
I can't protect you.

Tom swore to Mary that he didn't steal her earrings.
I miss you so much.
Tom never told Mary he was sorry.
Do not speak!

You'd better not spend a lot of money on this.
Hurry up!
Where is the safe?
I'll tell them about it.
Tom knew that Mary was following him.
Hurry up!
This is not Australia.
We have yet to find a satisfactory solution.
I don't understand the train.
I regret not telling Tom the truth.
Yes, please.
He left.
Keep working.
You have ruined your country.
Sami ate Layla's cookies.
Are you cold?
I need to talk to someone.
They were eating.
Tom was idle.
No one is angry.
Follow my advice.
They all sing.
What else do you want to buy?
I'm not your friend.
I think Tom is ready.
Smoke something.
Tom really loves you.
They want you dead.
I am a Muslim who believes in Jesus. Is there a problem?
You should always have a dictionary on hand.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
Be willing to be.
I can run.
I know who this book belongs to.
There are some spots on the table.
Have you thought about what you're going to give Tom for his birthday?
You look nice.
He walks slowly.
Are there any questions?
We told them not to tell you.
Something is smelling.
Follow your sister's path.
I'm very tired.
Stop looking at me!
Tom's room is always crowded.
You are a band!
You've turned my brain!
I'll be in Australia until the 20th of October.
Listen to this!
We can work on this right now.
Be ready to move quickly.
I have to eat now.
I'm not going to break anything.
Tom gave me some books.
I'm sorry that you failed.
The wind will blow.
Wash them.
Someone is watching you.
It's a pity you couldn't come.
Give it a shot.
Tom owed Mary 300 dollars.
I don't know who can swim and who can't.
They left yesterday.
Tom said he'd never heard Mary sing.
Nothing has changed.
Let him live as he wants.
Please let me have your car.
I did that.
Bring it if you can.
How did they find out about Tom?
My uncle visits me every three days.
Tom did not kiss Mary.
Try to shake it.
Do we really have to go back?
Cross the road.
Another day alone.
Tom should have bought flowers for Mary.
Tom escorted Mary to the house.
Tom will be buried on October 20.
Tom won't let you go.
Everything has a base.
Why do people go to the movies?
Why don't you listen to me?
I bought an old car.
It is disgusting!
No one can understand me.
Shut up Tom!
Are you an artist?
Are you ashamed?
Tom is drunk.
Tom emerged from his dream.
The cattle are not sick.
Go where no one knows you.
I don't like dogs that bark.
Is there anyone you want to see?
I don't use a computer every day.
Tom can cook.
Play!
I want to be a writer.
Pick it up!
Tom tried to save Mary from death.
Tom is a hero.
As long as you don't eat too much.
I am from the Kabylie.
There is one in the house.
I'm not a student.
Tom said that he wanted to quit smoking.
There's someone waiting right now.
Tom didn't see him.
What are you waiting for?
I want someone to help me do this.
Tom and his wife are divorced.
A gift is a gift.
I like to watch Western movies.
I can't see straight.
He'll come to your house tomorrow.
Tom is angry.
Are you in Australia?
I hope no one has seen you.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Who?
Shut up !
Tom always speaks French to me.
I have a contract to write.
I know some of those kids.
Do you mind if I take a break?
He wasn't supposed to see her.
I don't agree with you on this.
Please smile!
I'll pay for it.
Tom tried to swim across the creek.
Are you kidding?
Go home now.
It takes a genius to become a teacher!
Why did they shoot you?
What do they call you?
I'm going to do that today.
All my worries are over.
I sent her home.
I like it.
I heard someone whistling.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
Where is Wagadugu?
Someone is watching you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
Did you tell Tom?
How are you?
Why don't you call Tom to remind him?
Tom has been told something.
Please tell Tom to come in.
They all love you.
How can I ask you a question even if it's not a question?
According to science, man evolved from monkeys.
Tom is not a real witness.
Don't stop me when I'm talking.
Mary was kissing Tom.
Do something!
I was given a large number of books for free.
She went to swim in the river.
I think you should read this book.
Why are you afraid?
These are new.
Can someone help me?
Someone is watching us.
It's wise to continue working in a place like this.
Tom isn't dead yet.
Well, we'll make a mountain out of a molehill.
Somebody read to Tom.
Whose neighbor is this?
I'm going to eat now.
Tom bought me a Christmas tree.
Tom became angry.
Give me the one that's different.
It's closed.
Why didn't you tell me you were going to Australia?
You are talking.
Did they check them?
My dog and I are very friendly.
I saw someone kissing Tom.
Maybe we should tell someone.
The youth of today are very difficult.
Please don't be angry with me.
You have a call.
He doesn't know what to do now.
Do you have any questions?
The owl!
Please stand down.
Shut up!
What is this?
I should have understood.
She won't eat it.
What do you feed your dog?
Tom has the 20th of October to decide.
I was fired from my job.
Take me to the house.
You should see his movie.
You're all wrong.
You are beautiful.
Tom is the tallest in his class.
How are they all?
She is very shy.
You might have done that with us.
Eat your breakfast, John!
Tom doesn't always tell the truth.
You're just trying to make me feel bad.
I left Australia on the twelfth of October.
I wonder how anyone could possibly get their hands on this.
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
You're welcome to continue working in a place like this.
They stole my money.
I know Tom is very busy.
They are sleeping.
What can you give us, Tom?
I remember doing it again.
He's expected to come.
No one can swim.
I take care of her.
Boil the water.
Will someone help?
You are very clever.
Well, my son, the other thing is written.
I wonder if Tom has a gun.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Tom said that he didn't think he would sing.
I like it very much.
Thank you for cleaning my house.
I wish I was free again.
Give me more work while I'm hot.
What do you think of her new novel?
I can be stopped.
Are you Russian?
Tom said that he had never eaten Thai food.
Tom said he had a day off.
Friedrich Nietsche was a German philosopher.
Can you remember?
You're all worried.
When did Tom come?
What did you put in the box?
He became very famous.
I called security.
You danced.
Tom hurt Mary.
This house is small.
We're not ready to ask now.
Get out of here!
Who came up with this idea anyway?
I gave him a dog.
Drink your coffee.
I hope you understand.
How did you find me?
I saw that the problem would be solved.
"Where will our Kabyle end up?" "It will be a very good one!"
The computers are down.
I have nothing to fear.
I'm not trying to stop you.
I want to know everything you did.
Did something happen?
I think there's something.
Do you have a puppy?
Can you speak more slowly, please?
Someone wants to talk to you.
Put him down!
Are you here?
Tom lied to me.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia right now.
I'm not going to let it get to me!
Tom said he wasn't alone.
This water is stagnant.
Thank you!
Tom is being watched.
I like the light of the bottles.
Do you like Italian?
Did you find your letters?
I don't like you anymore.
I saw a dog.
What do you call this fruit?
What's my color?
I'll never forget that.
I just hope no one saw you come in here.
I'm sorry about that.
When did you start doing this?
I'll stop working.
It's finished.
I have to understand Tom's French.
He couldn't finish his dinner.
Look back in the back.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't well.
Tom wrote a letter to Mary.
I just can't.
Ahmad is a sinner.
A cup of tea, please.
Do you speak French?
Call me if there are any changes.
Please help me!
Have you seen Tom yet?
They're playing football tomorrow.
This is John.
How strong you are!
Tom is a workaholic.
Move along!
Sometimes something happens that we never expected.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Monday follows Sunday.
You'll be in Boston in October.
Did you see that smile?
Will you remember me?
You are right.
You speak quickly.
Are you hungry?
Did anyone else leave?
Go this way.
Jafar was drunk yesterday.
I am busy with my work.
Tom likes the countryside.
There is someone who is looking around.
You never told me you knew Tom.
Monday comes after Sunday.
I'm not your servant!
Why doesn't Tom want to stay?
What's your name on Skype?
Someone broke this key.
Play the game!
Follow your foot!
The food in this restaurant is cheap.
I'm going to bed.
I hate to lose.
Shut it down.
You are sick.
You should write a novel.
The one who is wrong is wrong.
I understood.
Who went with you?
They are as familiar as they are familiar.
Do the following.
Please help me.
You should cut your hair.
Tom bought Mary some cocaine.
We put a lemon on the back.
Make sure you know what needs to be done.
I'm going to stay in Australia now.
Tom walked home with Mary.
The bottom of my slipper is cold.
You are lying.
Tom and Mary are going back now.
I wonder if I like you very much or if I just love you.
The city was covered with snow.
You gave me all the money.
We found him alive.
Where were you?
The one who has taken my mist has blinded me.
Someone wants to send a letter.
Did you see his face?
I want you to quit.
You will find someone.
You are a dog.
I was preparing for them.
Did you blame Tom?
You can drive if you want.
They are joking.
Read it!
You found me awake.
Somebody has to do something.
I want to eat something.
Tom used to drink beer.
It smells bad.
Did you eat anything last night?
Don't leave your stuff here.
Tom needs someone to help him.
You came back.
Tom said he had never eaten sushi.
Someone is singing.
Will she come?
Someone has to stop us.
They've got you.
I will learn Esperanto in my country.
Somebody might see us.
I don't miss Boston at all.
Are these books yours or mine?
Tom didn't think Mary liked him at all.
This is what you need.
Give me my keys.
Get out of here!
Take these.
Tom just texted me.
Watch it slowly.
You can go home now.
Follow me.
I forgot to eat my dog.
You're a pain in the kitchen.
He is scared!
I live in Yerevan.
There's nothing here.
I know you'll find a way to do it.
Tom can swim.
Don't be afraid to fall.
They agreed.
Stop crying!
Tom is being watched by someone.
Put on your clothes!
My hand is aching.
Do you go swimming in the winter?
Tom will never forget Mary.
Please remember to say hello to your family.
You are lying.
They shook hands.
Tom misses Mary.
They died.
You can read this book.
I asked him to go with me, and he agreed.
Are you afraid?
I let Tom kiss me.
Let the water run.
Are you Americans?
You don't know what true love is.
They're laughing at you.
Go with your uncle.
Get up on your feet!
Tom plays the guitar.
The smell of insects is both pleasant and frightening.
Someone was listening.
Have you seen the new movie?
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
Stay away from me!
Is this yours?
Can someone catch us?
That's all.
Are you lying?
Tom is thinking.
Reading improves the understanding.
You might want to stop.
Have you ever been to New York?
Tom said that Mary looked scared.
You found us.
Do you think it would be okay to be angry?
Donate some money.
Is there anything that can't be done?
Tom is not as smart as his brother.
Look behind you.
Open the lock with this key.
I didn't leave her alone.
What is a computer?
Why do you want a horse?
Is he known?
Did you know Mary before you joined the party?
Show yourself!
Someone broke this box.
No one went there.
Tom and I are just friends.
Are you lying to me?
A book cannot be read by itself.
Please teach me how to sing in French.
I already told Tom I didn't want to do that.
Tom and I will always be friends.
Is French a language?
She is tired.
How cute!
Would you like to have some food?
I really love you.
Leave the shed.
Try to confuse it.
You and I are the same.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
I'm tired of reading.
How many books have you read?
That's the story.
Tom is a bit nervous.
How long?
Someone is lying.
Open your mouth!
How are you spending your time in Boston?
Where did you leave them?
Watch the television.
Do you want some food?
Make yourself at home.
Tom can't remember where he hid the map.
Have a good time.
The forest was silent.
I can eat whenever I want.
Tom and I were born on the same day.
Mr. Tanaka cried when you were gone.
Are your parents still alive?
I just can't sleep.
It's the top.
They're all hurt.
We are talking.
Tom kissed Mary.
I made a big mistake.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Bring me a plate of cookies.
He knows ten languages.
Sami hasn't played this game.
Tom built a big house.
Tom thought he was better than all of them.
I've always been proud of you.
I can't speak any other language.
Tom has never had a problem with horses.
Hello to everyone.
Tom didn't know that Mary did it.
He is a boy with many dreams.
Tom is angry.
The bear only scratched.
Why weren't you paying attention?
All the students in the class laughed at Tom's new joke.
Sami doesn't know how to get along with people.
Call me when you get there.
Why wouldn't Tom ask someone else to do that?
I have plenty of food.
Snow brings wheat.
Tom has changed.
Tom is blond.
You're not ready yet.
Get used to it!
The day is coming soon.
Holidays
Your cake is soft.
How have you been spending your weekend so far?
There's another one.
Tom saw Mary at the Halloween party.
Get up off your feet!
I want to meet your sister.
Tom is married to Mary.
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Tom made me angry.
Tom moved to Australia.
Can you lend me some money?
You are a good writer.
The diamonds.
Julia is singing.
This is a war!
Is there anyone?
Sam was living in a small town.
Tom didn't do what he wanted to do.
Someone saw you.
You're very different from us.
He loves me!
Back up!
He who fears the red will not prosper.
Mr. Sakaki is here to see you.
Tom then began to read.
Is there a problem?
Tom was not pleased.
Do you watch TV every day?
I like to joke.
Please tap gently.
Can you carry?
I'll do everything I can for you.
We would like everyone to be concerned about his own health, his own blood, his own family, and not to let the other person get in the way. If he wants it, let him take it. If someone takes your clothes and your clothes, let him take his own coat.
I am reading the book.
I need you to do something.
Will you leave me?
Tom said he had to borrow money.
Stop now.
Tom told me I was beautiful.
You are at home.
You missed them.
So who?
May I have some coffee, please?
Please answer.
This hall holds 5,000 people.
The wild boar has cut the road.
Tom's father abandoned his family.
Did someone come to meet you?
Is it windy today, or what?
I didn't want to wait for this.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
Tom didn't go to Boston until October.
Have you already done it?
Are you ready?
I've already told Tom that he should do it.
Can I say something?
We may need them.
Which is the truth?
Someone is in charge.
Are you making him a sandwich?
What danger do you see?
Can someone help me?
I gave him the little money I had.
Help me out of this!
Someone is watching Tom.
A goat is a poor man's cow.
Do you like Italian?
It was nice to see you again.
Go to the beach.
Pray again!
One side is the other, as the first said.
The house was on fire.
I told Tom why I wasn't there.
Tom looked at Mary.
Today is the second Monday in October.
Tom said he could help us do that.
Which one do you like?
When did you move to Boston?
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the wedding?
I came alone.
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the party?
Are they new?
You are my only hope.
Don't move!
Be kind to yourselves.
Tom said that Mary didn't work very hard.
French bread is delicious.
I've never needed so much money.
They waited.
You should talk to Tom.
Tom went back to the garden and looked here and there.
Tom nodded to say no.
I need to talk to someone.
Are you kidding me?
It's rude to keep working in a place like this.
Are you Russian?
I will return to Boston on October 20.
You are too tall for me.
I feel happy.
When did she get her car?
You have a chick.
Tom is happy.
What is your friend's name?
How did Tom get to Australia?
Who did you sell the movie "Hello" to?

You're going to dance!
I'm afraid we have to go if we want to be home before dark.
They're still after us.
Stop it !
We all miss you.
You can go home now.
Thank God.
This is my opinion, not yours.
I'll get you out of here.
Australia is for everyone.
All the wise men should have a mind so that they can see the light behind the darkness.
Someone is eating.
I thought someone had died.
What is a circle?
No one ever listened to me.
Who is wrong?
Tom is cheating on Mary.
Do you want to weigh yourself?
Tom danced.
He told me to come early.
What a waste!
It took me many hours to do that.
It must be over by now.
Stop being so stupid!
Wait here in the car until Tom comes.
Tom is a fool.
Please don't leave me here with Tom.
You don't know who we'll meet.
Do you remember what Tom said?
Show me your papers!
How many days did you stay in Boston?
There's someone outside.
I don't think I like Boston.

Tom felt tired.
Tom lost his horse.
The farmers ran straight to the market.
I'll never forget the day I met Tom.
I play the piano.
What do you want to know about my work?
You're on your own.
I hear someone talking.
Please add a little milk to my coffee.
He believes everything I say.
She wanted it.
When will you eat?
Are you married?
I think I'm just tired.
Kem is a brilliant student.
Please read it again.
Tom bought drinks for everyone in the bar.
Hello, my dear.
Please come in.
Have you seen my sister?
Has anyone mentioned it?
I want to have someone to talk to.
Why are you telling me these meaningless words?
Red is better.
You can get your money back if you want.
You have a lot of courage.
She doesn't pay attention to two things.
When I moved to Boston, I was about thirty years old.
Someone is waiting for Tom.
You have to watch out.
There they are, there they are.
I promised myself I would never go back there.
What do you think is missing?
Someone else might have been hurt.
Sami repeated his address.
We need someone.
It's you who's lying. It's not me.
The book is expensive.
Where is your son?
Tom is expected back in October.
Mary was kissing Tom.
Tom needs someone to help him.
Have you seen the queen?
This book isn't Tom's.
I don't know who you want to see.
Follow your dreams.
Tom spoke to Mary last night.
There may be other reasons.
Someone stole my food.
Let go of me!
They all agreed.
Be strong!
Just drive my new car.
It is still warm.
My son went to Japan.
Have you ever spoken to Tom in French?
Are you going to give this to Tom?
They are always blaming others.
Where is your God now?
Sami began to lose his mind.
Tom likes to read.
The house!
Tom is jealous of Mary.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia right now.
He was angry with his sister.
God knows.
We talked together.
Are you Tom?
No one understands you.
Tom likes to sing.
I hope somebody does that now.
Tom might be able to help you on Christmas Day.
Our dog is asleep.
You should get used to it.
All my friends have one.
However, this virus may have been brought on by the COVID-19 virus, which we were unprepared for and missed.
We bought this from Australia.
I just left.
Look at the road.
You told them a story.
Can you talk or not?
Do you know someone named Mr. Green?
Shut up!
Tom bought Mary something.
No one understands the absurdity of Omar.
Have you read this?
You found them.
Call me tomorrow.
A bird that is not fed cannot fly.
You have to accept it.
Use your brain.
Is this white?
Does God really call Muslims to kill non-Muslims?
She has a gold-colored hat.
Tom might have seen something.
Who ran away?
Tom looks very scared.
Tom is lying.
Where were you this morning?
Did you come to see?
Lidia, can you cook some food for Magdalena, Ania, Piotr and Lech?
Tom killed someone.
It's not me who's lying. It's you.
Have you slept a little?
I like the outdoors.
I'm not your girlfriend.
Be a good man!
I'll introduce you to some German-speaking friends.
Pay attention to your behavior.
I'm very happy about your visit.
They all speak Roman.
You know each other!
My garden is small.
He found them all.
This is not enough.
Tom's nose is black.
She doesn't care.
Peter bought a cat.
What were you saying to him?
Did you come from Tibet?
What did you say to Tom?
Tom wore his Halloween costume to school.
They all died.
Are you waiting for someone?
Someone is watching.
The woman said: "Let me go, wild one, I left you a treasure".
This dog was born in prison.
Tom started work on October 20th.
We were waiting for them.
Don't read to anyone.
You two talk.
Someone put out the fire.
Read your books!
I think I'll start with a beer.
Tom knew that Mary had gone to Boston.
Put your clothes on!
Nothing is beyond his means.
It's a fish.
Come by tomorrow.
Praise the Lord.
I don't think Tom speaks French every day.
Be careful.
Get up early, you'll find your place.
What are you wearing?
Someone else has already done it.
Do it now.
Have you had lunch?
Do you remember what Tom said?
I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
I'm not going to break anything.
You're wrong about him.
Thank you for your support.
To learn a language, you must know the grammar of numbers.
Get out of here!
Who heard that?
Mary and Tom shouldn't have stayed together.
Someone stole my money.
I'm surprised to see you.
She helped him.
Tom is angry.
Sit with me.
Please answer.
Every morning I ask myself why.
Here, I'm turning on the TV...
There has to be someone who can do something.
Have you finished your work?
Could you please leave us alone for a minute?
She lied.
His head is full of worries.
He is neither right nor left. I am a bird.
She already knows the answer.
What do you like? What don't you like?
Who are you?
Where are we going? What have you seen?
Where is your grandson?
Tom will follow Mary.
That's right!
Try to find a cure.
Let me go!
Tom is already on the bus.
You don't seem happy.
Can I go home now?
Tom shaved his head.
When will you come to Algeria?
I heard him yell, but he didn't talk to his brother.
You are lying.
Tom will never believe me again.
What is valid in one language may not be so in another.
Was anyone hurt?
It's going to snow.
I like to eat out.
Someone has stolen my passport.
Tom is back.
We found Mary.
Who wrote this book?
Latin is a beautiful language, which creates music naturally.
Is this Tom's car?
Tom thinks a lot about Mary.
Are you sure you intend to leave without saying goodbye?
Tofu is very tasty with sake.
Why would you think that?
Tom introduced Mary to the Church of Satan.
Tom is drunk.
She might leave.
How could he love a girl who was so innocent?
She drew water from the well.
Do I look pretty to you?
Someone stole my food.
Sami sat in the middle seat.
Tom and I are separated.
You are a tax payer!
I wish I could be alone.
I didn't wash your car.
She always thought he was handsome.
You can change this if you want.
Stop blaming me for this.
Muhammad is a true prophet, isn't he?
Who's there?
Are you crazy?
Tom's happiness was short-lived.
Tom lost everything.
Water, please.
I need someone to talk to.
Tom is good at public speaking.
I was just joking with her.
I don't like playing baseball.
I'll be out of work in November.
They have plenty of money.
Tell it to everyone.
Do you have a problem?
Tom is dying.
Tom was seen on October 20 in Boston.
Tom is a good boy.
I'm glad to see you again.
Stop the noise.
You and I like to play games.
I feel like I've been cheated.
She loves him.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Somebody told Tom the truth.
I can teach you to cook.
Where did you go to eat?
Tom has to go to the doctor again.
Tom is my best friend.
It was snowing.
Mary is a nurse.
Alice is asleep in her room.
Tom called.
Shut up!
Do you like this dress?
They kissed.
You are welcome.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom cheated on Mary.
Please call him.
Sami and Layla were always fighting.
Do you want to read something?
I opened the door for Tom.
Is there anyone you want to read to?
Tom is wearing a Halloween ring.
I'm just waiting for her to come out.
I need to learn how to defend myself.
We can all speak French.
He plays the guitar well.
Do you want your wife to speak Spanish?
He married his sister.
Someone answered our call.
There is always someone there.
Can you take him to her?
I left you some messages.
Who owns this camp?
Today I was tomorrow.
You can't drive.
Someone is staying here.
You've already paid.
Australia is one of the only countries I visited last year.
It's really amazing.
Tom sent you something.
Is there anything you want?
Show me your papers!
Go and change your clothes.
Is it October already?
You are crazy!
We are brothers.
Be nice to people.
Please, who can open the door?
I live in Azerbaijan.
What did you do today?
Are you crazy?
I'm mad about you.
My uncle visited me every three days.
This book is heavy.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Are you dead?
Tom said we should wait here.
Leave it to us.
He was sorry that he wasn't invited.
I'm very happy about your wedding.
Tom walked up to Mary.
Choose one.
It's your time!
She is talking.
Are you Canadian?
You're crazy! I thought you were going to hang the flag! I didn't see that!
Mary held Tom's hand.
You are unbeatable!
Some plants are quick to catch cold.
I've had a bad day singing.
I spent the day by the sea.
You can have anything you want.
Come on in here!
Listen to your teachers.
Tom is a respected man.
Everyone should leave his trust to himself.
I know Tom's secret.
Have you talked?
Art is dead.
Aren't they Tom's friends?
He smiled.
This is for you.
Are you a human?
Are you happy with this?
I called for help.
You like to dance.
Tom believes in Mary.
It is a wash.
A person who is ill or has something wrong with him is called a yuki.
That's what I think.
You'd be surprised what Tom drinks and drinks when he's out.
Are you expecting someone?
Are you mad?
Please forget this matter.
Tom seems busy this morning.
Follow me.
Calm down, Tom. You are in a bad mood.
I want you to try this.
Someone stole it from me.
Are you going to eat it all?
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Sami is also a teacher.
Look how it is cooked!
Are you going to go swimming?
Someone stole my food.
She forgot it.
Will you sell your house to Tom?
I like games.
I don't want to tell Tom what happened.
Check these out.
Tom moved to Australia.
Mary was surprised by Tom's answer.
She saw the truth.
I didn't recognize him.
I'm not even going to deal with that.
Tom was jealous of Mary.
Is the car good?
He is going to kill me.
No one has sent me a letter.
I have an idea for it.
I can't protect you.
Is it over or is it still over?
Who went with you?
Tom wants to make a lot of money fast.
Nothing has changed.
I have to meet Tom.
Hold on a second.
I'll take Tom's place.
Is this paper?
I'm at home.
You can go home now, too.
Where are your sisters?
I really didn't think Tom would say that.
And now, you're a hero!
Each one pays for itself.
Read it again.
Somebody had to pay.
Keep writing.
I don't need your staff.
Have the children eaten?
He is crying.
Why do you need a sword?
Tom is currently living in Australia.
I am a nurse by trade.
It's the wind.
Tom and Mary are playing cards.
Tom is asleep.
How can you be proud of such a man?
I'm the one who's been spying on you.
Tom is drunk.
Are herbs banned in Australia?
Somebody is going to lose.
Tom forgot how beautiful she was.
We need to find someone who can help us.
He went off the highway.
He is tired.
She likes to fish.
Someone is cheating on Tom.
I'm determined to grow up.
We were both tired.
Spring has come.
Is there someone you want to see?
Tom took the keys to Mary's car because she was drunk.
You can't drink here.
We have a car!
Sami and Layla have been together for years.
She kissed him twice.
I agree.
His idea is better than yours.
Stop it!
I hate computers.
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
It was their idea.
They are worried about Sofia.
Are you finished?
She stopped him.
Where is the door?
Help us out.
Sami didn't even look at me.
We have a guest.
Hit him!
Where did Tom learn French?
He was sitting and reading a book.
Someone is eating.
Can you give Tom and I a minute?
Layla was dating a bad boy.
You can't prove anything.
Mary came in.
Stop complaining!
Tom can't solve the problem by himself.
Sami doesn't know who Layla is.
How many books do you have?
You are special.
Nothing happened at all.
The top.
You are all very kind.
He went to Spain.
We asked for 40 seconds.
Where is your son?
Tom complained.
They didn't say anything.
Someone has a problem.
Please be quiet!
You should eat something.
This is a fool, absolutely. And he's a president.
I read books.
Forget about Tom!
You are better than Tom.
I ate it.
Come to the house.
You asked Alex.
I like to swim.
Please protect me!
I won't accept your mistakes again.
Tom is married to Mary.
How much can you pay for this?
Why are you afraid?
Be ready for the blast.
Mary is as old as Tom.
Go to my room.
I have to do this now.
Let the water flow.
It is springtime.
Agato will die on the 20th of October.
Did she use it?
Dad, give us the flute!
Please help us.
I'm surprised to see you.
You keep on crying.
Does Australia have four seasons?
I don't think Tom did it.
Tom got rid of the wind that was blowing.
It is old.
I left Australia on October 20th.
Have you eaten your dinner?
I can see how you're reading.
Tom is afraid of his father.
Give me the gun!
Hi, this is Nancy.
I left.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
I'll wash my clothes tomorrow.
They both can't pronounce Tom's name.
Get out of here!
I'm not used to going to Boston in October.
Sami isn't going to stop.
The meat.
You are a problem.
Ahmed is jealous.
Has anyone seen anything?
Someone called you.
I need someone to help me.
Be patient, old man, he will come soon.
Are you Chinese?
The two met in October in Boston.
Uli Rohde, a beautiful German woman, sings a love song in Kabyle in the land of the Kabyles.
Did you put everything in?
Somebody has to do it.
Latin is a dead language.
Only Tom should know about this.
You are a saint.
How do you feel?
You look sick.
I'm going to do that, of course.
Tom and Mary seem to be close friends.
It is impossible.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
I have money.
I love her, and she loves me.
Sami and Layla finally went to the wedding together.
You are blinded by love.
You are very lucky!
We saw it.
I know her.
Tom was kidnapped.
The black cat is eating the white cat.
I will go.
Put on your clothes!
Someone shouted.
She bought a bottle of water.
They are safe.
We'll ask him something else.
Are you ready?
What's your favorite team?
Follow your sister's example.
It is close to my bed.
You still don't understand.
Dinner is served!
I asked Tom to leave then.
Tom can't get to Mary.
Could you show me a picture, please?
Sami left his rifle there for protection.
Are you kidding me?
Is that Japanese?
Did you see anything?
I need you here tomorrow.
Mary is waiting.
Tom looks sad.
Tom has lost his temper.
He is a god.
Tom returned from Australia.
Forget about Tom.
We talked about Australia.
Tom said he couldn't eat any more.
He is not a boy.
Someone else has already done it.
I don't want to live with you.
I speak a little French.
Tom told Mary that he was awake.
I have seen dozens of Asian countries.
My garden is small.
I'll die for you.
Your work is only a small part of it.
He beat Tom.
Your work is just a one-sided effort.
I took an Uber.
These books are not Tom's.
I want to eat with you.
Take a little rest.
You can give it to whoever you want.
Can you watch Tom?
What did your mother say?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
I'm going to eat a banana.
You are not joking.
Tom wants to marry me.
I didn't sleep until after sunset.
Tom thought that one day the rabbit would protect him from the rats.
She knows how to live.
I was very busy in October.
Can you help me, please?
The spirit is upstairs.
Sami is a very difficult person.
The teacher cheated on my bag.
I'd like this book, please.
I like funny stories.
I am a human being.
It's our turn!
Can this happen in Australia?
Call Tom.
October is only three months away.
You are happy.
It is a miracle.
Don't mess with me, Tom.
I'm not a thief.
I was in your marriage.
What's in it if anyone sees it?
Seek and you shall find.
There's nothing you can do to help.
Sami knows his limitations.
Just let me see it.
I don't know why I'm laughing.
It looks good.
I'm not your maid!
Do you drink a lot?
Someone came.
Some say it's a joke, others a lie.
Are you still in school?
You are part of the problem.
Someone wants to hurt you.
We'll discuss this problem in the third chapter.
My name is Jack.
Let us know.
Tom couldn't possibly have escaped.
Tom wants to make a lot of money by gambling.
The mountains are wet.
I'd better tell him that.
If you don't want to do it, don't!
The sick baby was being closely monitored by the doctors.
What a mess!
I like to write articles in my own language.
I hate to work.
Give it up!
Listen to yourself!
No one can find him.
Shouldn't you be working tomorrow?
There is no Nobel Prize for mathematics.
Please shut up!
I want to know everything you've done.
Help me clean the garage.
Can you see your table?
Tom said he'd be there tomorrow.
I'm thankful for your success.
I'll see you in October.
It turned out that I had a brother.
I'll ruin this place if I mess up.
Take care of yourself.
I forgot your number.
Are you asleep?
I am starting a new life.
I've been thinking about you.
I like to eat pizza.
He who can bring down mountains can erect walls.
Tom was talking about Mary.
No one knows why.
We just finished eating.
Are you crazy?
Don't lose your way!
Take a walk.
Someone did this.
You'll find Tom in the corner.
We did it only once.
I know French.
You have a fever.
Does that make you happy?
You shouldn't be so afraid.
Someone called for you.
I want to surprise everyone.
What was the recipe you found, Tom?
Read your book.
I'm going to go, Mom.
Tom said he had a day off.
What a bitch!
You are a good student.
Someone broke this plate.
I thought I'd talk to you again.
I won't be alone.
Look for another.
Tom started to laugh.
Which author do you like?
I already know Tom.
Let her go.
She built it.
Do you want to tell him?
Whose boat is this?
I'll try to help you.
No one is listening.
I want to learn Esperanto.
Please help me.
No one is worthless.
Who am I speaking to?
I'll look after Tom.
My brothers!
I want a new dress.
Tom likes good people.
This is from Australia.
Tom stopped smoking.
Somebody has to stop Tom.
It's all together.
What kind of girl do you like?
Your day has come!
Try to scare Tom.
Why didn't you take her home?
She got angry.
Did you give Tom a birthday present?
The building should be up in October.
Tom is sometimes angry.
Can you swim?
Are you sick?
Listen to me!
Do not speak!
I see you.
There is no one.
Have you ever been in a relationship with a rich person?
The day is getting brighter.
Do you have rice?
He likes himself.
Tom wondered why Mary hadn't done that again.
Tom is bored.
Tom is getting closer to Mary.
How much bread did you eat?
This boy is a good boy.
French is difficult for you to understand.
I think there's someone in the front room.
Finally, the snow is falling.
He refused to believe her.
Who is this neighbor?
You're playing the guitar.
I'm very happy for you.
I need the truth.
This house is very small.
Don't forget your money.
Take your days off.
Tom is a hero.
Someone is looking.
He was fired.
It may be true.
Every question has an answer.
Tom will tell you what to do if you ask him.
Stop whining!
How many of us will be there?
A friend of mine called me last night.
Tom ran outside to see what had happened.
I saw someone kissing Tom.
You can read this book.
Tom loves you.
You should change your behavior.
Someone is here or has been here before.
Are you here alone?
Close your eyes.
Who said that?
It's good for you.
We serve with what we have.
They don't want me to tell them what to eat.
I haven't said anything yet.
My job is to teach English.
Tell them I'm here.
I think he ate his vegetables.
I need someone to help me.
I intend to tell the truth.
Layla heard the carriage outside.
When he was young, Sami would forget.
Do Mary and Tom understand French?
Are you at home?
Where are you from?
Someone is waiting for Tom.
They'll do what I tell them.
I don't want Tom to stay.
Who said that?
Is this the first?
You're just being yourself.
My wife has a lot of work to do.
I don't have to say anything.
Stop the smoking.
She has a very beautiful smile.
Don't say a word.
Tom isn't like that.
Why aren't we going home?
I want to talk to one person.
I did nothing.
Sami saw the video.
Turn to the right.
Remember last year.
Tom bled.
Let's dance.
Someone has to do it.
To your health and better days!
You can have anything you want.
Take care of yourself!
I love you very much.
Tom is working on Mary.
This is a gift for you.
Just take me home.
I think Tom is right.
Tom Jackson is my favorite author.
I wanted to kill you.
No one knows who killed Tom.
You should ask!
She speaks English.
Tom collects old things.
No one heard the speech.
I'll take that.
You've already paid.
Tom misses you.
Look at yourself.
I don't think Tom was told the truth.
Mine is bigger than yours.
It's a good car!
I know Tom is a liar.
Eat all you want.
What sport do you prefer to watch?
Please don't forget to say hello to your family.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
May I ask who you are?
She remembered me.
Teachers should explain everything in detail, not just whisper and tell students to go home and read their books.
Tom won't drive his car today.
Who was the last?
Are you ready?
Are you people?
What we don't like makes us stronger.
Are you a witch?
Most Hollywood movies have a happy ending.
That's all for now.
Whose car is this?
We are heading there.
Has anyone called the security forces?
We should get to know Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
We are expecting guests this evening.
Get out of here!
I don't know what to tell Tom.
We can if we want to, but we can't if we don't.
I could ask you to come with me.
They say that the deed is the same as the reward.
Tom is drunk.
It's the police!
Are you serious?
Are you drunk?
The famous Kabyle writer Mulud Feraun, who killed OAS terrorists in 1962, said: "We only know who we are when we become someone else".
I need someone to help me.
He's going to learn French.
I think it's a beautiful place.
Come this way.
I think Tom and Mary are tired.
Don't hold it against Tom.
How much time?
Sami doesn't need this.
The way to the future is through the door, the way to the future is through the door.
I hope Tom is scared.
He didn't help his father.
I hurried home.
Human religion is more open than God's religion.
I didn't hear anything.
Don't leave!
I don't eat raw fish.
I eat and drink.
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Check this out.
He left everything.
I'm not a girl.
Do you like dogs?
Do you like football?
Champagne, please.
I want you to work with them.
Sami didn't like that.
She tried to kiss my ass.
Tom has a daughter who is going to be a cousin of Mary's.
Who are you waiting for?
I want to know who's coming with us.
You should be stopped by someone.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I just want to tell you that I love you.
Who is your brother?
Were you here alone?
Sami has known Layla for many years.
Go to the shore!
Mine is better than yours.
You can kill anyone.
Beauty is a curse.
I didn't understand what the teacher said.
I didn't know Tom kissed me.
He spent several months in Scotland.
I'm going to eat a turkey.
We are waiting.
Your day has come!
Why?
There is no ticket.
Have you read the book "The Last Beginning of the Mind" by Taher Ja'at?
You are such a fool!
Please invite Tom in.
Will you be in Boston next summer?
Has anyone called you?
She can't love you.
Tom lives in Australia.
Tom answered the question many times.
Tom has a black hairstyle.
Don't forget to call.
It's not a problem at all!
The snake is giving a thumbs up!
Have you seen my sister?
How do I correct mistakes in writing in Kabyle in LibreOffice?
Why are you sitting by yourself?
The Islamic god understands only Arabic; but one may pray to other gods in any language one chooses.
Your father is a coward.
You need a good wife.
Something is missing.
Let me borrow your car.
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
Add another cookie.
What are you having for lunch?
What happened in Boston?
I know Tom is from Australia.
Tell him tomorrow.
He refused to come to me alive.
Why don't you do any of that?
Let Tom go.
Tom asked Mary.
Mistakes have been made.
She must be the one who will do something.
I hate you!
Just talk to them.
I want to see your sister.
What were they going to drink?
I'm going to learn English now.
We'll do it again.
I didn't speak French when I got there.
You're lucky to continue working in a place like this.
What do you want her to do?
Thank you, that's all there is.
Tom is getting married in October.
Don't you know you can solve this problem yourself?
Is there someone you want to see?
Sami was hoping to get better.
Sami was young.
Both of my parents live in Boston.
He asked his friend.
The room was covered in fog.
Tom didn't get into Harvard.
I don't think you talked to me.
The government was lying in wait for the people.
My grandfather loves to read.
I want to see my son.
Tom loves his job.
Sami is not a coward.
What did your doctor say?
Open your eyes.
I am a coward.
Do you understand?
You fooled me!
He knows how to play with words.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
Lock your windows!
He will arrive tonight.
Tom looks tired.
You used to call me sometimes, didn't you?
He cheated!
Are you Japanese?
I was shocked.
I miss you so much!
I was in love with her.
Tom is a coward.
Can you do more than that?
Tom took his daughter to school.
