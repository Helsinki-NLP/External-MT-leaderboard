Inflation rises due to food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant increase in food prices.
The November price growth in 13 Eurozone countries was higher than expected, with an annual inflation recording 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast predicted only 3 percent, Bloomberg.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the basic interest rate with the fact that the decrease, along with rising raw materials prices and decreasing unemployment, would lead to an inflation spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below 2 percent, but close to them.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to “remove” inflation so that it has no need to do anything in this matter later.
In Germany, the November inflation of 3.3 per cent is a 15-year record, and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the eurozone has risen up due to the rapidly rising food and energy prices.
The term price of wheat rose by 88 percent, also the price of soya reached its highest value since 1973.
Likewise, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for food oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on the world markets this year rose by 52 percent and last month a barrel of black gold already cost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from this year’s 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, but in 2009 it will already fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the level of 12 months inflation in the next 3-4 months will continue to be approximately 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce the interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
Following a prolonged stagnation in early December, the Fidesz group has grown significantly and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the socialists, the Gallup Institute has never targeted such a low – 13 percent support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support compared to the five-thirds of support for MSZP.
The MDF and the SDSZ are below the threshold for entrance to parliament: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among certain party voters, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The opinion of the public on the economy worsened even due to the previous minimum – the ratio of those who consider the country’s economic situation very bad, so high – 41 percent, while according to the other 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families evaluate the change of their material situation after spring and summer more hopeful prospects now again more pessimistic.
As for the next year, a greater proportion of the population is expecting further deterioration and only a tenth is expecting improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, which is the most of all Gallup Institute’s survey, judged that the prime minister performed his work rather badly than well.
Ferencia Gyurcsany is believed or very believed by 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
54 percent don’t trust the prime minister at all, 27 percent trust the Fidesz movement.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how large part of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be solved without a change of government.
While after the outbreak of October last year, the remaining government and prime minister considered the desired 35 percent, the current share is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in the drawing up of new elections.
For the interest in the referendum, it is indicative that 60 percent of respondents answered the question about their potential participation, that the referendum would come, and another 20 percent said it would probably come.
For comparison, "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would participate only 55 percent and another 15 percent consider their participation likely.
The school would say no 74, the doctor’s fees 79 and the hospital stay fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people promising their participation, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital stay fees would reject 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth down Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle retained the last year, an average 16 percent price level growth with the difference that this year there was no VAT increase.
Posts in Napis Economy
The usual Christmas consumption basket of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs trade triangle this year increased an average of 16 percent, but in all hypermarkets the price showed an increase of more than a thousand forint.
Since the prices in food supermarkets "flighted" already in December last year, the percentage, given the previous high base, did not show such a drastic decline.
For consumers, however, it is unpleasant that what they could peacefully buy last year at a price below nine thousand forint will not be purchased now even for ten thousand.
The consumption basket of the Daily Economy in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological boundary of ten thousand forint at least 91 forint.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forint.
(In 2003 the cost of the consumption basket was 6 800 forint.)
The price of Unica and living fish remained almost on the last year’s level, but the brutal breasts, nuts and macs were very expensive.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forint.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forint.
Likewise, it was surprising in this store that the price of the two-litre Coca-Cola in the return bottle was below 200 forint, so even with a backup the product was only 257 forint.
However, this year, according to the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság Auchan, it appeared as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices figuring in the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság rose by about 15 percent compared to the prices last year on Christmas Cora, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent.
Comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest value, the difference was 12 percent, while the growth between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest was 21 percent.
In the forints, the increase was an average of 1 480.
The average price rise last year came to 1 206 forint with the fact that last year on Christmas prices were influenced by the VAT rise.
It was this process that the trade broke down, the shops were obviously unable to decide how big the price gap should be set for the individual products, as they were unable to predict what the impact the price change will have on consumption.
(If a trader plays the rate of circulation of a product incorrectly, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year, the price rise of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket showed so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forint higher than in 2006, while the cheapest price difference was 844 forint.
This year the extreme difference did not appear, the most expensive basket was now 1.630 forint more than last year, and the cheapest was also 1,284 forint.
Comparing both Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price rise appeared, in less than 20 months, the daily consumption of goods in the hypermarkets dropped by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, is not completely confirmed by the data of the Central Statistical Office: it has measured, for several basic foods, a price increase exceeding 30 percent over the course of 12 months.
For example, in the case of eggs.
In the latter case, however, it seems almost impossible, according to the Daily Economy’s consumption basket, since the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, showed a price growth not exceeding 10 percent, even in the worst case, given the basis.
The powder suppliers occupy stronger positions than the egg suppliers, and the drastic increase in prices has succeeded in the international chains.
Hypermarkets in the commercial gold triangle don’t complain, they still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited stores are no longer interested in prices.
Everything they buy quantum, durable food they take after payments.
On Wednesday morning, long fronts were formed in all three supermarkets, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, the turnover in the countryside is lower, a number of international chains complain to research companies that sales are behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved.
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals, mainly due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overload of beds, overload of staff stop the disease don’t help, says the primary of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
Recently, a MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatological department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic resistant bacteria was discovered in a man who was hospitalized after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but shortly afterwards he had to return with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria found in his body, one important operation has not yet been performed.
By December 10th this year, 1,094 hospitalized infections caused by multiresistant pathogens were to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, primary member of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multiresistant pathogens were registered in hospitals with certainty, the others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin resistant gold staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria is carried by a third of people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsil inflammation, skin infections, early infections) react well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered in excessive or inappropriate extent, bacteria that react well to antibiotics develop bacteria which is highly resistant to antibiotics and which spreads rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent poor functioning of the immune system in patients with weakened body, low body weight or in patients in years can cause serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the senior doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infection belongs to the daily practice in hospitals.
"The infection should not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not just there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the pathogen is not examined."
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the care staff treats them in rubber gloves and in the mask and for their treatment we have the necessary antibiotics," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients hospitalized are first examined if MRSA is present in their body, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
The sample is not in fashion.
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favorable for the prevention of the formation and spread of multiresistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection occurs symptomatically in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should check the hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the MRSA carriers.
However, taking microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
It is also important that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund this examination.
The most cases are so revealed if the patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, the primary member of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, patologies.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, or a microbiological examination should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but the hospitals do not comply with it in all cases.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in the basic or ambulatory treatment of patients, Karolina Böröczová said.
Saving on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is spread among patients most often through medical staff.
Therefore, the washing of hands and the use of gloves and masks plays a very important role, but there are also serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by drop infection and by touch, but in the conditions of home hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
The rooms, on the contrary, are often overfilled, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, unfortunately, we can also encounter that in hospitals that are in a disadvantaged material situation, disinfectants are saved, healers are few and patients a lot, thus the chances of developing infections are increasing.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are proved less or the further spread of the cause of the disease can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge cost for health insurance companies, therefore it is fighting it everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written a MRSA prevention program, respectively, reducing its occurrence.
As it seems, the program is successful, according to published data show MRSA infections in England a decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has ranked the prevention of multiresistent pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens among its priorities.
Police captain who caused a deadly accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain XXII. district, who caused a deadly accident, is finished.
It can be excluded that the police captain of the XXII district, who on Tuesday killed a pedestrian and who at the same time resigned from his office, would drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the spokesman of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office of the capital Attila Morvai said on Friday after the expert assessment of the case was completed.
The expert assessment confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which already found that the former police captain did not drink any alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then director of the police department of the XXII. district crashed on Tuesday in the Lajos Kossutha street in the XXII. district with his own car while rebounding a fifty-year-old man who entered before him when passing the road outside the marked passage.
(The latterly named fact that the pedestrian passed outside the zebra, otherwise according to the rules of road traffic is not a relieving circumstances, the reverse car must still give priority.)
After transportation to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned from office and requested the transfer to service, according to the police, because he was so shocked by the case.
The investigation is carried out by the Budapest State Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain worked with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
$400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks of a total value of EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of €300 million for Hungarian budget financing of projects in the field of transport and the environment, implemented by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties already signed a loan agreement of €100 million, the now signed agreement concerns the use of the remaining €200 million.
A loan agreement of €150 million is also used for the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining €150 million can be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties have signed an agreement of €50 million, which the budget will be used primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also a discussion on the 4th metro route.
The parties agreed that after Hungary agreed with the EU on the details of the metro financing, it would return to whether and how the original treaty should be amended.
That could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of €8.4 billion for 113 projects in Hungary.
The interest rate of the loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a liability fee is bound to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the real paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing – the attention of all Europe is turned to the previously slightly neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying on the ever cheapest, but rapidly rising EU market?
The Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought after Eastern European real estate purchase destination is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
From the mountains are most in the course of the areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunshine coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčiku.
According to analytics from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the interest of investors and the central part of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will raise, and more and more interested people are also shopping in the vicinity of the very cheap city of Russia.
Also the capital of Sofia is the promise of attractive options, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to turn into one of the most attractive golf paradise in Europe, making it next to the summer and winter seasons the searching destination of the routes in the next two seasons.
The predictive investors are already buying in large, for example in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cyprus investors present, and there are traditionally many Russian customers near the Black Sea and ski parishes.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or lost old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they subsequently renovate.
They require good availability and possibilities of communication, important for them is the proximity of the big city, shops and, as a rule, the local doctor.
The second category are chatting buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German recreational destinations in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a value rise in the medium or long term.
The decline of real estate in the capital is continuous, as the demand is increasingly strong.
In Bulgaria, the real estate prices are the lowest in the European Union, but in the last five years they have increased by 21 percent per year.
The rise in real estate prices significantly exceeds salary growth.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the Ministry of the Environment and Water Economy, Gábora Fodor, the meeting of experts will be completed on Tuesday, and after the official opening on Wednesday, the international conference on climate regime after 2012 will continue with ministers’ talks.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world are negotiating the Bali Travel Map, which addresses the efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
There is an intense debate between developing and developed countries.
The U.S. has also announced that it is now unwilling to negotiate accurate figures, although it tends to reach an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 in view of the situation in 1990.
Another big question of the conference is whether the developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that are referred to.
The agreement also came into force on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidiary fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member Board, probably within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the magazine Piac és Profit.
6% Hungarians
Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in the efforts to protect the global climate and to help the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to the level of 1990, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "Accord after 2012", and is ready to commit to a reduction of up to 30 percent if the other developed regions of the world, respectively, are willing to assume responsibilities and commitments corresponding to their possibilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set for a reduction target of 5.2 per cent, with the 15 EU member states committed to 8 per cent.
The commitment of Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the years 1985-87, which our country will meet.
A long-term climate policy agreement must be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would be prompted until 2012.In this case, the commitments to the reduction set by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be bound by a new emission reduction system, the need of which was also pointed out in its latest report by the International Climate Change Scientific Committee of the United Nations (IPCC), which is the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reduction and an inevitable rise in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army Launches on YouTube
British military units are publishing on a video sharing server recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they are popularizing themselves.
For the first time, the British Air Force (RAF) liked YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan have recorded videos of the actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC.
The recordings taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet are controlled by the Air Force Command controlling the combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the internet.
The political message is inevitable.
This form has already reached the internet 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers and more than 75,000 people have watched their channel.
The British Ministry of Defense registered in the spring of 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes records of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Unit in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Implementation in Afghanistan
The air forces have published videos according to their original intention for the purpose of recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good to inform the general public about the real goal of the army’s presence abroad.
“The propaganda published in this form compared to traditional television recruitment ads is almost nothing worth,” Defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told BBC, “but it necessarily carries in itself a certain political message, as it in a special form confirms the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government.”
The Americans Played
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, the server gets also amateur videos, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in somewhat hypocritic, “official” promotional films, the officers are mostly talking about losses, but the bloody form of the struggle is not shown.
The internet has already received many videos from combat sites in Iraq and Afghanistan, which have emerged during a sharp deployment, but the British army has only arrived on them now.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently - using a shooting game named America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through more or less loyal simulations get directly into the skin of soldiers.
In the ministries will be Christmas with Tombola and Pagacks
The Minister of Labour, Monica Lamperth, is unlikely to be sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will organize a final work meeting for her colleagues, on which she will say goodbye to the 2007 pagacks and coffee.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere it will charm officials the Christmas atmosphere with a button and a drink.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - so you enjoy the powerful.
Government officials are preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration will be held by the Ministry of Defense this year, but it does not expect its employees to attend it.
On the Christmas of the orphans, the gifts will be received by the children of the fallen soldiers, the Mission Christmas hosts the family members of the soldiers, currently serving on foreign missions, but they also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort is dedicated to the atmosphere by the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be throwing out of the coffin compared to other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the center of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forint and from six hundred ministry employees, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will hold the Christmas traditions at its celebration, but it will also take place on various performances and will also loose the tombola.
NFÜ's Christmas cost 4,700,000 forint and took place on Wednesday in the State Justice Council (OIT) building - at the programme were concerts and dinner.
The rental room cost a million forint, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
One department of the NFÜ appears to be invited to another Christmas celebration: there will be a tender company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from the EU funds.
For this purpose they rented the theater building.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we failed to find the person concerned.
Clothes are not needed
The OIT building was hosted not only by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas organized the St. Lucy dance on December 7.
However, the OIT did not want money from him for the use of his rooms.
500 people participated in the dance.
The dinner began with the health minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] on the dance were not mandatory evening clothes or clothes at all.
The Puritan party is scheduled by the resorts of healthcare, labor and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forint in its own building.
Minister of Labour Monica Lamperth even officially invites collaborators not to a Christmas party, but to a final work meeting.
A hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press department, will only receive coffee and pagacks, so the party will only be enough for 350,000 forint.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai, and his colleagues will simply drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas meeting, which awaits 436 employees, in its own large hall.
For the Christmas party, he devotes 2,500 forint per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a drink.
Since ministry János Veres, PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way each year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the officiality will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The resort of agriculture hosts a new year reception on January 20th, ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in the castle of Vajdahunyadvár in the City Sades and according to the Ministry's statement, 1,000 forint per person is intended for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
This annual reception begins with a short health minister and ends with a small craving.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize the Christmas party at all, the corresponding press department told the portal [origo].
The price of Christmas celebrations were not announced in the press department.
Four hundred people were invited to the art museum.
A huge strike.
The League and the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ) will set up a strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's unlimited strike.
The public assembly will be held on Saturday, and on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the health insurance law - the work will be stopped.
The event will surely cause serious traffic interruptions, as the railway transport will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Enterprise (BKV) will strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League associations will meet the National Union of Workers' Councils with the details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
The strike commission LIGA-MOSZ will also be formed, which will coordinate the action on Monday.
On Saturday, a public assembly will be held, and from Monday, the trade unions joining the strike will stop their work for an indefinite time unless there is an agreement with the government.
This means that the deadline for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law, has not been set.
If the Parliament eventually fails to adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
However, if the legislation is voted, the strike committees will meet and decide on the further procedure.
According to the Monday agenda of the Parliament meeting, it is also possible that the law on health insurance will be voted only in late evening or night hours.
Because of the strike that starts on Monday, it is possible to count with serious traffic interruptions: on the railway work will be stopped for an unlimited time, in the morning part of the Budapest public transport and more than half of Volán companies can stop.
At the same time, many places in the country will also be closed half of the route.
A number of trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, whose list is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organizations announced an unlimited strike, while others announced a temporary stop of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Railway Workers' Union (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree even on sufficient services, while the start of Christmas holidays increasing number of people travel by railway.
According to the previous communications, from the start of the operation until 13 hours will be strike at the BKV, from 7 to 9 hours in the morning at the Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike is organized by the LIGA Energy Industry Workers' Union, to the 2-, respectively 2-8-hour stop of work called for by the Pedagogs' Union and the Democratic Pedagogs' Union.
The Union of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government should revoke the proposal for the health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that a new pension calculation method, which is valid from the next year, be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, to ensure that early retirement for the relevant sectors of employment can be included in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Railway Workers’ Union (VDSZSZ), which belongs to the League’s trade union, does not accept the Ministry of Economy and Transport’s offer on railway shifts and is expecting a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country Risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, increased the political risk of Hungary and the entire region in several ways.
The company’s “risk warning” states that, in the context of the Hungarian Guard’s activities, the greatest political risk is that, “by focusing on the existing ethnic tension between the Romans and the Romans in Hungary, violent ethnic conflicts can occur within a short time.”
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is likely aimed at provoking such action – the research institut adds.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: “the public discussion on the Roman issue was left by the leaders of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Rom-Hungarian contradiction.”
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the Research Institute, under the influence of the great attention of domestic and foreign media “have greatly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity.”
The Institute reminds: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which since autumn 2006 is getting more and more publicity and wealth, is that in Hungary since summer 2007 have been formed several organizations, which themselves call the associations of "National Homeland Defense".
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as a civil association, while openly declaring – even armed – the willingness of their members to perform defence tasks (in the case of natural disasters, attack on the homeland, disturbance of order), in addition with the indication of the incapacity of the police, the army, or the state,” he added.
He further notes that all of this is done in a way that seeks to pack the various political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and the parties to civil clothes.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association, therefore, in the case of these groups, does not only serve to avoid the legal failures of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is an increasing risk factor also in terms of neighbouring relations.
“In recent months they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard right in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, and the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries, referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard, want to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this can affect the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the Research Institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
The activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
On the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard stands the massive Roman rebellion that exploded in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
This BNU used to establish the Guard with the fact that the organization's goal is "National Homeland Defense".
In the last 17 years there has been "Cycan terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, the Institute of Political Capital reminds.
He added that the initiative has triggered a burstful discussion by the Bulgarian public.
As he further writes, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is a sign of the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guard on the sign of resistance.
Since the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Romans also react to the threat in a similar way by establishing their own domestic defense, we can read in the risk warning developed by the Political Capital Institute.
At the question of the press office, Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute said: Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued every year and if they find something that could affect the risk change, they inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not everywhere.
In Hungary, the holidays are precisely established by law and it has already become a general practice that working days move around holidays, which awaits us less times next year.
There are no unified holidays in the European Union or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
Work days are usually linked to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is working holidays - for the New Year already so that people can rest after the New Year.
We have a total of 11 holidays over the year.
National holiday is the 15th of March celebrating the Revolution of 1848 and the 23th of October, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August we celebrate the foundation of the state, on 1 May work, on 1 and 2 November we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, there are two-day holidays of Easter, Summer and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays according to the calendar rarely fall on a weekend, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases that we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price for prolonged weekends, however, is that the previous Saturday we stay at workplace and at school.
The time we work on the day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday, has been regulated by the Ministry of Labor in a special decree for many years.
The legislation shall apply equally to all employers and employees employed by them, to public employees and to persons in public service.
It does not apply, however, to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or with regard to their destination operate even in working days.
This year there will be a change in the working schedule just around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24 life in the country will almost stop, since according to the previous experience most people "work" in advance the days between Christmas and New Year, or thus take advantage of the saved holiday.
In the next year, some of our holidays falls in the middle, respectively, to the end of the week, so the work day movements will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is converted around the work holiday, so that the workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26th April will be a working day, so on the contrary, Friday 2th May will be a day of rest.
The next move is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October will work instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year, however, the next year will be able to take place completely in the sign of holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost everywhere nonstop holidays even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 scary little things you can make your colleagues angry
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost don’t even notice: all of this “make” the everyday days at work.
The question is if you get used to these little discomforts, or if you put your gloves and the unclear situations that others may be angry, you will deliberately avoid.
the tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were searched for from the marketing department,” the colleague will tell you.
Have you missed the meeting?
In a better case, he will regret and try to fix it, or call the marketing department and say that the message has forgotten to pass (this is less common solution).
The problem is solved by one excuse.
Before there is a shameful apology, it is good to think about how you could prepare unpleasant moments to your colleagues, and consciously try to prevent it.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more unpleasant than when you stretch yourself for some writing, office needs or for your phone, and they’re not there.
Do you remember that you put a coat on the table yesterday, but it is gone until the morning?
Or did you find on the table of one of your colleagues your pen that you thought was lost?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will be rightly angry on you that you are grabbing them in things.
Don’t take out of the office cover or adhesive paper, because it can be unpleasant when you get premature, and you’ll need them immediately.
The private life of colleagues.
There is no good solution to stop the spreading clots.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and Why?
Don't hang everyone on the nose your news (dominals) about the private life of colleagues!
When any of them shares their inner secrets with you, do not abuse their confidence!
Lock in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence do not deal with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Do you report your absence?
If you call the office and with reference to a severe headache you report your absence because you’re not well, or you say that today you’d rather rest, think that your work, urgent tasks and work, which have a certain date, will have to be done by someone else for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work, or that something may happen that causes you to stay at home, notify that your colleagues and leaders will not face your absence until the next day.
Toughened Laminated Safety Glass
Did you get into a job from which you will be thickly pulled out by a coworking colleague?
Have you been witnessing a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your colleagues by cracking, singing, loud call (hype above your head), or duping, constant cling, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disturbing even when they are not blocked into any project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you accuse others of mistakes?
If something isn’t in time or you’ve forgotten to send an important letter or message, don’t blame others for your forgottenness!
Do not appeal to the possible chaos in the office and the noise of colleagues!
Recognize if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask how you could put things in order, fix the negligence!
Do you feel like at home in the office?
Clothes and clothes: comfortable clothes at home, but not in the office!
Don’t wear clothes for your free time, even if your profession allows it!
Don't be neglected, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular dresses - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegantly!
When a person wants to fit, he ceases to be interesting.
The normal morning constipation.
A special melody is heard from the radio: the sound of the housle, to which electronic effects are attached.
I add the noise.
Music changes the pace and the bas is added to the previous tonic colour, then the female body is joined as a real jewelry.
On the mr2 station, Zagar’s song called Wings of Love.
The domestic music life has long not just scattered us with a high-quality electronic pop.
But suddenly the constipation looks quite different because you’re just listening to the new album of Zagaru.
The appearance of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions coming from the domestic digital underground, the overall picture is slowly changing, and although the garage rock is again in fashion with its melting into the guitar, even the domestic electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began in the Fifth Castle and he also played in the Yonderboi band, until he eventually - because two dude do not go into one line - went on his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines the elements of jazz, electronic dancing styles and pop, he began to break up until he was called to compose film soundtrack (for example.
Ference Török’s “Sezon”
His formation, playing in the beginning in smaller clubs, recognized the wider audience after the magazine wan2 ranked their first 2002 album among the fifty most important home albums and declared Zagar in Yonderboie as almost the only home entities determining developments that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "in the course", although, of course, no one asked them if they are satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as it belongs: it made a new, better album.
The now released album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open them new roads, although the name itself is trying to create a follow-up with the initial flights in the Five Stones.
This is one verse from the song of the old band Balázse Zságera.
Reference to ethical, flight would be on the site, but besides the ethical breath of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of time - more loud guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs at the premiere of the album in the Millenáris Park presented the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the band The Puzzle.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the mr2 Petőfi station, playing popular music last time from morning to evening, we began to play the mocked melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is OK (?).
The portal spoke to Balazse Zságera.
H.H.: In the context of this new hit, the question is, how much remains what you play, the edge music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of border music does not mean much for me.
I think there are two different casts of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don’t say anything, and it can only arise because of the sale, which makes it commercial.
Of course, even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is accepted also works, regardless of language and state borders.
Q: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In the abroad, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people after twenty, but also the elderly.
Much more they follow the transformations of light music taking place around them, as they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
Q: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where and how many people listen to your music?
B: Of course, it is a good feeling that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be seen in concerts where mutual influence already works, but that is hidden only in the untouchable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed that when a person wants to fit the audience, from that moment he ceases to be interesting.
How much will you follow the example of Yonderboie?
He worked solo and built his career rather from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We do not actually go his way, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain our music.
We are rather team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
In the beginning, of course, it was not possible to avoid that our work was not compared to the songs of Yonderboie, because a few of us separated from his band and went on a different way.
In the toplist of mr2 Petőfi, the song Wings of Love got the first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
With a more popular style, did you consciously open up for wider layers?
B.Zs: We didn’t plan to write a hit to which we would sell the album.
This song is about more.
We thought it as the final album, with which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
Q: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs: The idea was to create such a gospel church.
Then came the idea to make this group from the soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member body – Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh – was gathered together, which we then crossed to Underground Divas.
Q: Is this the way you’ve written the song, or is it the way you’ve written the song?
B.Zs.: The song had long existed in the instrumental version, when the material was then gathered on the plate, we thought that something would be needed for this song.
The follow-up of the acords led to adding a song party to him.
Even that night I singed a melody on him, which the girls later learned.
This happened for the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it resuscitated, but of course it needed Wonders to do so.
With my voice it would not work so energically.
On the album and on the concert it seemed that there were girls in the background.
They don’t have solo (except Judy Jay), they don’t have their own roles, they sing completely together and they’re not louder than music, so music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They were also on the stage.
It intentionally?
B.Zs: The fact that they stood behind was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we don’t want to divide solo roles is, on the contrary, intentional.
Even that song is about to forget a little about our ego, who is from, where it belongs, and to just let those wings, the wings of love raise up.
I wish that this euforic state that we felt when that song was born would be felt by others.
Q: Which was the most work?
B.Zs: During the composition of music actually not with one, heavier pieces occurred rather when mixed.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he long didn't want to work groove, then everything beautifully slowly found his place as in some slider.
Q: Which new album is your favourite?
B.Zs: That’s always changing by the concert and by the fact that I’ve already released the album.
The prophet is a fool, escape from the earth and never the same.
A betrayal broker threatened billions of money
A good defraudant.
This is what the French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the Commercial Bank of France, named Jerome Kerviel.
It lost about 5 billion euros for him.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to deal with his colleagues and, in addition, definitely not unable.
Unlike all major banking houses, it recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
“He’s mentally weaker,” he heard from the mouths of his superiors who sent him to the police.
According to Kerviel’s statement by the French media, for example Le Monde, he was a man who had a profit of €1.6 billion from his shops at the end of last year.
Not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros from the U.S. crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income customers or those who have had problems with reimbursement in the past, will have problems.
This crisis had no impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn’t believe it and was beting right.
At the end of the year, the profit was up to €1.6 billion.
"Once when I earned the first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel acknowledges, adding that he definitely didn't leave anything for himself.
During the interrogation, he acknowledges that he has falsified records so that he does not come to him.
He even managed to crazy the bosses, even though the Eurex stock exchange began to be interested in his shops.
Risk is profit.
Was he afraid he would come?
rather not.
"I thought the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to gradually develop on his position.
He entered Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005 I knew they were watching me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development,” Kerviel told the investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first big success.
Thanks to the shares, Allianz earned half a billion euros in London bombing.
And that was the launching mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we will leave you.
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But the boss said they knew everything, or rather they knew it.
“As long as I earned money, they turned their eyes.”
But then the wound came at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to get rid of it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working in the bank.
And a few days later the bank that it lost five billion euros due to it.
How did they come to him?
He became suspect for his leave.
“I chose only four days for the last year.
A broker who has no leave is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to see him in his records,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance of earning 365 billion dollars
The Ministers of the Czech Republic and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can obtain in the coming years 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion SEK).
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion SEK will be spent from seven operational programs to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to earn about 100 billion SEK from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will be directed to transportation.
The Transport Program is the largest operational program and accounts for up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
These funds will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be managed next year in the amount of SEK 90,8 billion.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme aims to serve entrepreneurs and companies to gain funds for innovative business.
Companies should gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful countries in the EU funds.
Former President of Nicaragua sentenced to 20 years in prison
An appeal court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed a 20-year prison sentence for the former president of the country, Arnold Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (about $1.8 billion).
But later he was released from prison and lived in a home prison at his haciend near the Nicaraguan metropolitan city.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison, it is not clear at the moment, according to AP.
According to appeal court chairman Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to prison officials whether they will let Alemana serve his sentence at home or travel to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that he regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the account actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money then ended in the fund that Alemán founded to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was approved.
It is so.
The state budget was adopted.
What is this budget extraordinary?
It is the first budget prepared by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year he went through with the support of the CSSD, because he was prepared by the minister Sobotka and the CSSD could not afford his non-acceptance.
Unlike the crowded debate before the vote on unreliance to the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally neglected, although the most influential, law in peace.
This is a certain paradox.
Every rule begins and ends with the individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or doesn’t like it.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power rivalry of the government with the opposition.
This is more medially grateful and therefore he is given much more attention in the media.
The puzzles of politicians are much more interesting to the public than strict numbers.
The state budgets in the past social-democratic governments suffered three disadvantages that the one for 2008 is unable to solve at once:
The first of them is the high share of the obligatory, so-called mandatory expenditure law, which is not only pensions, but also social benefits, which last year before the elections was approved by the silent "coalition" of the CSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit management as a result of the failure of the first.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits of municipal and municipal budgets.
However, the biggest risk is not the government’s budget deficit.
It is public and relatively controlled.
However, the time bomb is the deficit of municipal and municipal budgets.
Many mayor, in order, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, to obtain additional resources for investment, often headlessly issued bonds, by which they disproportionately debt their municipalities.
In the past years, they have managed to pay these debts by the mass sale of the shares of energy and other distribution networks that they received from the state from in privatization.
They no longer have this source.
If we only adhere to official and verified facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been undergoing a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, and thus it is constantly proud of the CSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put the public finances in order.
Instead, the government has increased its debt.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonably than our republic.
This is a huge shame that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are at the lowest risk of poverty globally.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, just in the last few years have completely unnecessarily swallowed into giant dimensions.
Although some of the meaningless populist expenditure approved this year before the elections has been eliminated, so if in the near future there is no retirement and retirement reform shift, then in fact any policy in this country will end, and no matter who governs it will be just officialization.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing the majority of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the outpressing of normal expenditure by mandatory expenditure.
The planned $70 billion deficit for 2008 would be completely useless if the past governments did not manage what they could in the last ten years.
If we don’t really want the ruling politicians to become just officials, then we have to be patient and allow this not too strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can spend only as much as it can get on taxes and fees, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow the progressive achievement of a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided together to fight the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will come to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks are drawing the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to the auction, while another $24 billion will be made available to European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time after the September 11 attacks that the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is to address the biggest difficulties of the economy, the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow,” said Bernard Baumohl from the Economic Outlook Group.
“Central banks’ coordinated actions have reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting more billion losses.
“Central banks have to really be afraid of what can still be following when they have decided for this process,” said ABN’s chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks are worried that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will be able to borrow their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy to a recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks decided this after they failed to lower the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate that is used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutually borrowing money, even though U.S., Canada and Britain’s central banks lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting to Reuters.
Some analysts don’t think that the step of the central banks will contribute to the burning of the crisis because it doesn’t solve the basic problem, and that’s the fall of the real estate market in the US.
The ecologists are incredible.
Global climate change is the most harmful for developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has once again addressed the global warming issue.
The criticism was now addressed at the end of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue, not the Green Planet, he said the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference, which is formed by a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also a fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and the reality.
“The debate there is completely unstructured, it’s just a flame of words that are a replacement for solving current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President, presenting his book, emphasized that its topic is very important to him, and therefore he is so engaged to them.
He also expressed satisfaction over the fact that the book appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter the caricatures of my opinions."
Now, therefore, the interested can read his unfathomable attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climate scientist, but he has enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, capable of monitoring and assessing professional discussions, has experience in statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main conclusions of the book he referred to the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are thus normal, that there is no consistent opinion of all scientists on the global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not represent a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are useless, inefficient and unacceptablely expensive.
Furthermore, as a person with experience with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to force unproofed opinions by others, which he feels as a dangerous limitation of freedom.
At the questions of the present, he repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits."
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver's license could not exchange 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange the old driver’s license, which expires by the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the exchange, so that the authorities can still issue a new card to them by the end of the year.
But the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would go on the road without valid permits after the New Year.
According to the authorities, the passport was not exchanged, especially for those who do not want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of a driver's license, the authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed by applications and the interest in the exchange of a driver's license has increased this week.
The Magistrate receives about 2,000 clients per day.
It is about half an hour on the front.
More than 140,000 drivers have not exchanged their driving license.
The release of the new license takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to apply for the issue within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay $500.
Drivers who do not get the obligatory exchange of their license until the end of the year and go out on the road without a valid driver's license will be threatened with a fine from January.
The prosecutor will pay up to two thousand crowns.
A police officer can resolve the offence by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the penalty will rise to $2500.
According to previous information, he could receive a fine from the municipality and a person who will not go anywhere.
He claimed that he could pay $30,000.
The ministry previously urged the authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum of a thousand coron fine.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, a ten thousand penalty is not in danger to anyone.
The driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
This is not a civil card that every person must have valid.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving license.
It is only necessary to take it away or send it recommended by mail to the competent municipal office.
At the end of the year, the licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
However, drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three years to exchange.
The validity of the certificates issued between 2001 and 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are approximately 2.6 million additional documents.
Court reduces penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are charged with a criminal association with the David Berdych gang, will be sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided that the penalties were reduced by one year and the other two years.
Initially, the detectives of the Prague Committee for the Combat of Organized Crime threatened 14 and 12 years.
There is no more appeal against the judgment, only appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is only waiting for a first instance judgment.
In other cases, he was sentenced to a total of more than 16 years.
He can’t get more.
The district court in January recognized 19 people guilty of participating in the robbery, the Supreme Court today addressed the appeals of 16 of them.
The majority of the accused have rejected the allegation since the start of the investigation with the fact that it is a constructed case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, police officials, after an agreement with Berdych, inter alia, transferred to criminals information from police sources, covered individual theft and helped members of the gang to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave up 30 percent for Opavu and Konjarik.
The allegation is about the gang’s criminal activity between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, the rape, whose victims often suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of the powers of a public official and illegal weapons.
At home inspections, the police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, a laser target or a firearm.
The gang was charged with theft for tens of millions of kronor.
In addition to almost twenty men in this trial, the courts have already legally recognised the guilty of other theft of Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men from the surrounding district of Berdych are still confessing before the court in a different proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomáši Půt and Maroši Šulej, who are in Irish detention, waiting for a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Account for confusion of children: 12 million
For the misconduct of children in the birthplace, the lawyer of the damaged families, Igor Veleba, wants a compensation of 12 million crowns, plus court expenses.
For each mother by three million, for the father by two million and for the child by a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The law enforcement officer Andrej Dostál therefore disagrees with the proposal of Veleby.
"We reject such a request, it's very high," Dostál said after today's talks.
But in order to make an opinion about the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterpart has prepared.
We’ll see if it has a remarkable value.
But we remain in the view that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should range between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňova family wanted a million crown for every month she did not raise her biological daughter.
Veleb served as the basis for negotiations on the compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
The parents of children, according to experts from the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychic injuries and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even though they met with regrets that the confusion of newborns was not prevented.
Women are worse to deal with the actuality of the trauma and what is happening right now, Veleba summarized.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by nurses in the Trebić birthplace on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermákovým to Přibyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brožov and Jaroslav Trojanov to Jabloňov.
The Hejtman of Vysočiny Miloš Vystrčil delivered at the end of October each of the families 100,000 crowns for the refund of the expenditure that they had caused by the fault of the Trebić Hospital, which the district establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are lawfully insured for liability for damages.
In the event of a mistake, they must touch the reserve fund, exceptionally they can request the founder’s help.
The courts have so far granted people a relatively low compensation, the amounts were counted according to the tables in orders of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The Soup Has Lost the Kingdom of Wales
Bolek Soupka lost the dispute about the brand of the Valašské královstvo.
According to the judge of the Ostrava District Court, the name was first used by the Valašsky King, but the project was built by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
The Supper did not attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
“The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolka Soupka,” said Polivkov’s lawyer after the trial.
According to him, at the words of the Valašskaya Kingdom, everyone will be equipped with actors and comedians.
Harabish has the same opinion.
“We have been working for almost a decade.
Searching for money and inventing actions,” he said.
The reason for the dispute is money.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something from it.
They want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the King of Wales used the Sup for the first time in his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At that time, however, it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš came with the idea of issuing the Valaš passports.
From the original recessive event, the trade and lucrative business activities, which Harabiš then founded the company of the Valašskaya Kingdom, came out.
In 1997, Soupka agreed to put his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said that Harabiš only took advantage of the naked idea Polivka published in a maneuver for his business intention.
“The popularity of Boleslav Soup of the Valašsky Kingdom project has helped,” the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who was intensely dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today disguised parties continued until the year 2000, when Harabiš for Soupka organized an official crown in Vsetina.
Since that time, however, disputes have begun to accumulate between Polivka and Harabiš, which culminated with the dissolution of "King Boleslav I, elected to furt."
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polivka submitted a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court today rejected.
It would clearly bring Harabi's planned throne and half the princess to the dispute.
A new king should come out.
The details and dates were not revealed yet.
“We don’t want to rush.
It should be like a journey of kings to Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Soupka can also be registered," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi Test: Disappearing Prejudices
Indeed, I’ve never had a lot of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of ranging, driving and also production could be labeled leckdy as under average.
But on the market is now the successor of the Peugeot 207, and the one is a lot better.
And the combi called SW goes a little further and I have nothing left but to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, of the head space on the back seats.
This is already the end of the complaint, because the carrosserie combi means that in this direction they will not suffer even two meters long.
Flight to the World
I’m going to go through very quickly so that I don’t repeat too much.
This is a very successful design, where I have the only excuse to the poor middle tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design inventions when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or seats.
The side line has also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As for the space, there is also an increase in the dimensions of the carcass.
There is a lack of space above the head.
Baggage to Baggage
The main thing on this car is his luggage.
I have to evaluate it as a very well-accessful (and thanks to the clamping back window) and as a well-common.
The loud places are equipped with backgammons, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not interfere, it can be stretched and keeps even heavier objects.
But let’s stop together over the volume.
According to the tables, it is 428 l in the basic order, which is rather an average value against competition.
The best-selling vehicle of this class is ŠKODA Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the young Boleslav product, then we will find that Peugeot is behind a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
On a vacation abroad or when loading a car, this value is critical.
But if I had to highlight the positive, then I still have to mention the completely straight floor after climbing the second line or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6 l fuel four-wheel with a power of 88 kW.
And to say the truth, this should look like the sixteen hundred who drive a family hatchback.
It is silent, has a small consumption and, above all, it draws.
If I compare it with the harmful period that leckdy acts, as if it had a drawn hand in the exhaust, then I can only be excited about it.
The price will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we need to keep in mind that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a fuel fourteen hundred for 329,900 CZK will still go away.
Our aggregate costs from 410 900 CZK, which is already quite enough.
The tested premium equipment will then get the equipment for another 80,000 CZK upwards.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic running of the strawers, electrical control of the back windows...
The cost of the car is approximately 531 900 CZK.
It’s a lot, but count the additional equipment at Fabie and you’ll get a lot of similar number.
There is only a choice for a brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
The number of children in Eastern Europe’s UK schools is increasing, causing concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europe is facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases where disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous people are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants begin to escalate.
Disagreements, harassment and disputes between students have also been translated into the relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who melted a 10-year-old student with a iron stick.
She is accused of being offended by racist insults.
The police had to intervene after the attack of two young girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly honoured the man with racist notes and throwed stones on him.
“When we went home, a boy climbed to the bus stop and began to swim on us.
When I told him to let it go, he turned on us with apples and grapes, and then revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak students told The Times.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the local settlers even described disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrants begins to be tensioned.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK to work here.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
It is a island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can meet you if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, quiet like a river.
Palmy and all inclusive with servers offering pizza, ice cream and drunk cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
Only on one island but you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spanish, Cuba was the basement of their conquest of America.
Columbus described it as the most beautiful place ever seen by the human eye.
Havana became a warehouse and treasury that the Spaniards in America picked up and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew up in the late 20s.
He was left to build one of the chiefs of the U.S. mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the U.S. (especially for the prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were the
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, height houses grew up, the widespread boulevards riding cars that belonged to the cult symbols of the 50s of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paula, a bit away from Havana, and in Cojimara he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguity del Medio the signatures were left by showbusiness stars and politicians from all over America.
And today?
On the walls of the Havana Bodegata you can leave your autogram as well.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you are mixed a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those cult cars of the 1950s are driving around Havana so far, because once imported silk and fiat in the salt and wet weather have long been shining.
Havana, especially its oldest part, is considerably shattered, yet none in the surrounding area has so many wonderful colonial monuments as just there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much needed money, its development has a green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the Holguin province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another libost, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by trainers.
A third of the widespread plantations were swallowed into sweeteners after the narrow roads of steam and motor trains.
Their car park has not been renovated for many decades, so there are functioning machines, whose companions are elsewhere only in the museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors of Cuba don’t know.
And so about Varader or Havana there is no need to be much written.
Maybe just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway settlement there is a museum and whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
Bujna vegetation grows from a calcium floor.
Mogots, calcium homols and rocks strictly raise from the bottom of the valley and in their caves a fertile land has been captured, thus the windy rocks are covered with a thick porost.
The Valley is the place where the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
With its final shape you can meet if you visit any of the Havana cigarette factory.
Per someone’s interest is that there was the Chilean part of Major Zemana.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought to him the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was transformed into the beauty and excellence of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has almost not changed over four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain, is a place so distant that in the 1950s there was no road that would connect that region with the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay on the side.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was broken, everyone was glad that he had a roof above his head.
If a person has more time to Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the nearby area, such as Playa Ancón, or the Cukrovar Valley.
The evening then belongs to the Casa de la Música, which revives after the darkness and the music in it is silent over the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the east of Cuba is one of the most beautiful on the island.
Of course, this opinion affects the way itself.
Both roads that lead there from Guantanamo must cross the high and broken mountains and pass through the nature that human activity has almost not noticed.
The eastern coast of Cuba has been listed by UNESCO in the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the Columbus Navy) and from the hill, where the former castle and today's Hotel El Castillo stands, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigarettes, the mountains of Sierra Maestra, the Gulf of pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, the African religions that confess the descendants of former slaves, all of this could be described in many pages.
But, as it is said right, it is better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
The lack of military personnel and the lack of necessary equipment affects the course of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
NATO’s Defence Minister, Robert Gates, said it is expected to plan a specific plan for the coming summer.
The mission in Afghanistan does not go as expected, the representatives of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance by the Taliban movement, eight stakeholders today are discussing further plans and co-ordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through the Defense Minister Robert Gates, called on NATO forces to take more action, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and increasing development assistance.
“The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next thing is to allow the people to start further economic and security development by themselves,” British Defense Minister Des Browne told BBC.
90 percent
The activity of Afghan rebels is the highest in the past five years, according to the U.S. military.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they ask for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We will have to seriously think about the specific goals for the next time and the ways to them,” Gates said.
This is the case with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop.
“I’m not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about nine percent of the soldiers and the equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
Over the past few months there have been controversies between the countries involved about whether all the allies are doing the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany was criticized for passivity.
“The Germans have a relatively large number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting demands to them are not as high as to us in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
The British bulvár newspaper Sun this week called the German soldiers linous.
“Afghan pilgrims revealed: the Germans play while our boys fight,” Sun wrote in a material, supplemented with images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild passed into the counterattack and printed a picture of the British unit during a ragby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt rises to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech country has a debt of more than 84,000 SEK.
The total debt increased by the end of September to SEK 842.7 billion.
The government plans to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of the governance of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to SEK 842.7 billion.
In the last nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion SEK.
Since June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion SEK.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of more than 84,000 SEK.
Over the past year, the government has borrowed more than $111 billion.
At the moment, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year we could exceed the border of a trillion kronor only in 2009.
The next year the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion kronor,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek.
Similarly, the Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikora sees this: “To exceed a trillion we could get through the year 2009.
When exactly it will depend on the next budget, which we don’t know yet.
If it turned out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debt Grows
State debt forms central government debts and arises primarily by cumulating the deficits of the state budget.
State debt is funded by cash bonuses, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s internal debt has increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor this year.
The country’s foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion.
The so-called trading state debt at the end of September reached 803.3 billion SEK and since June fell by 13.7 billion SEK.
The average length of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt between the first and third quarters increased by 13 percent, which is really a lot on how the economy is going well.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it will be with what to trade when there’s pension reform,” said Pikora.
Better than expected
The government’s financial and debt management strategy for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of the governance of the state budget.
The amount is mainly the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
Furthermore, the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency are SEK 13.3 billion, a 10-billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of state bonds of SEK 43 billion and the payment of loans from the European Investment Bank of SEK 1.8 billion.
A woman has been sentenced to court in Chartum for giving her name to a plush bear.
A British teacher, sentenced in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Chartum court on Thursday night and expelled, according to her lawyer.
She was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a plish bear the name Mohammed despite the fact that any image of the prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was sentenced to wound bite.
This four-fifty-year-old British teacher, working at the Unity High School in Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, after the parents of several students filed a complaint to the Sudan Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in the month of September, when the subject teacher asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class squat bear.
“There will be eight names from the children’s mouth, including Hasan, Abdulah and Mohamed,” said Robert Boulos, director of the school.
After a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children will eventually choose the most popular name Mohamed.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all it is a very widespread baptism name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohammed."
The bear itself had no label with this name, but the problem is in the image of a prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that she knows her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive for any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked children to vote for a name," he said, it was just a "innocent mistake."
Many teachers also share this opinion, describing her as "very careful to her students" and adding that "he never talks about religion in the classroom."
Remember that the baptized name Mohammed is also the second most frequently awarded baptized name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This baptized name often selected by Muslim families represents a way to worship a prophet (often is given to the firstborn).
What are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Is it possible to give them toys?
This is a question of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Finally a failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and last round of the talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome the differentiated views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "in bet" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to take care of their commitments to peace and be ready for dialogue even after negotiations ended.
“We don’t expect violence in the near future, but we’re going into a challenging period,” he added, adding that “it’s obvious that the situation is stressful.”
Negotiations end on December 10
The negotiators of the Trojka, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last visit Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian speaking population, could be shown in a brighter light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, are the sixth and last round of negotiations since the United Nations, in August of this year, commissioned the Trojka for a new negotiation.
The U.S. and Europe are expecting the talks to end on December 10th.
The Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo’s independence in the UN Security Council, on the contrary insist on the continuation of negotiations even after this deadline.
"Russia was and remains inclined to a negotiated, compromised solution," said Bocan-Charchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence.
After eight years of administration of the international community, the West considers Kosovo’s independence under the EU’s supervision as the only compatible solution.
Priština declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare its independence unilaterally.
Belgrade is seeking extended autonomy.
“Unfortunately, we haven’t reached any agreement,” Kosovo’s President Fatmir Sejdi said in a hotel in Baden, where this “last chance negotiation” took place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, the former rebellion commander of the Kosovo Albanians and the future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “is of the past that led to murders and deportations.”
“Domain Effect”
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the contrary, believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is concerned about the “dominary effect” in the area which is still unstable as a result of the 1990s war for independence.
“For Serbia, however, this does not mean,” he said, “that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right of veto.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word.
"For Serbia, only the solution arising from the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica said.
“These talks took two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu replied to the journalists that "the last word about the status will be the Kosovo parliament" and added that if the unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian speaking population would take place "by agreement" with the West.
Bush signs agreement with Palestinians and Israelis
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland called by his encouragement, U.S. President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians finally agreed on a joint statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed on the immediate opening of negotiations with the intention of once and for all to resolve the 60 year-long dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he will do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must stop colonial activities, Bush said, reminding the obligations that for both sides arise from the “roads map” to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the talks between Israel and the Palestinian self-government led by Abbas are aimed at “the conclusion of a peace treaty that would solve all unresolved issues without exception, including central issues.”
This statement includes three issues that are at the core of the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled during the conflict in 1948 from their homes on the territory of today’s state Israel.
Abbas took the words after the U.S. President and emphasized that the subsequent talks should be "comprehensive and thorough" and to touch all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Then Olmert spoke at the tribune, who expressed the opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it should "seat on to be concluded during 2008".
Bush determined the end of 2008 as the date for the realization of his “visions of two states”, Palestinian and Israeli, existing next to each other.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has accepted a commitment from Bush in this sense even before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," the prince judges in an interview that he provided to an Arab-speaking newspaper protected by the Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As it always happens with such little news from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the Investigation of the General Inspection of the French State Police (IGPN), the police car passed through the Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday shortly after 17 p.m.
“The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but it was on the patrol and passed at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, with no side lights on,” the police source explains.
The green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to drive on public communications" (read below), driven by two young people without a helmet, passed "very high speed".
"The motorcycle crashed from the left to the police car after it did not give priority to the right," a police officer said.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle's crew was negative.
The condition of the car (the defeated ancestor, the broken front glass, the broken crashers) indicates the sharpness of the crash.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry has responded very quickly and has already announced yesterday morning that the IGPN has commissioned the investigation of "the acts of unintentional murder and non-assistance to persons in danger", which is at the same time taken by the direction départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Directorate of the District Police of the Val d'Oise department).
At the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by IGPN excludes, at this stage, the police responsibility for the accident.
Three witnesses who were under investigation on Sunday night confirmed the "version of the police officers, namely that the minimo was relatively quickly approached to them from the left."
A rise, undoubtedly caused by treating clips around the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained blunted until the police car was able to stop.
Vehicles have been secured and will pass technical expertise.
On the bodies of the two victims, a pitva was carried out yesterday.
What happened immediately after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, the speech was rapidly spread among the people that the police should leave the site quickly without providing first aid to two young people.
IGPN should, in all care, also exclude "any serious offence" at this point.
“This is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more search and with which we need to be very cautious,” a police source said.
The journal "Libération" met with an eye witness of those minutes that followed after the accident.
One of his windows then leads directly where the accident occurred.
“We immediately went down with our cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to resurrect them,” the witness tells us.
I couldn’t do anything.”
Then he saw a “plugged, completely scared police officer.”
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth spoke to the phone.”
Faced with the rapidly growing tension and the certainty of the present that the situation of the young people is hopeless, the police were taken by the car of the colleagues who, in the meantime, arrived at the place.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police departed."
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
“No one should say that the police authorities did not rush to help the young people.
The young people were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to rescue them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions in Pakistan Grow
Pakistani police on Monday rejected the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared the state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the framework of an extraordinary state, were wounded with tear gas grenades, which, according to witnesses, used order forces.
The latter responded with stones, wounding several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were invoked.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Some of them had to be called.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The arrival streets to the Supreme Court were overwhelmed on Monday morning in order to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations were scheduled to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the advocate movement received the support of religious parties grouped in the political strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "invited the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the extraordinary state, and waste to those who swore before Musharaf."
“Musharaf’s promise does not apply.”
The Pakistani Supreme Court is the direct target of the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
In the next few days, it was planned to declare the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election, which took place on October 6.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is unlawful, unconstitutional and against the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the official told The News.
Parvize Musharraf's promise to give up the leadership of the army and become a civil president "not applies" after the introduction of an extraordinary state, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up military uniforms until November 15, when his first presidency ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be delayed.
The Pakistani government has also rejected the country’s continuing speculation that the representative of the head of the army had to order President Musharraf’s domestic imprisonment.
More than a third of pregnancies still make up unexpected pregnancies
This estimate includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unpredictable pregnancies.
More than one in three (36%) pregnancies are still unexpected today, according to a study conducted by the French Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined) - the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which legalized contraception in France.
This estimate includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unpredictable pregnancies.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
According to the Institute, the use of hormone contraception in women between the ages of 20 and 44 has increased from 5 percent in 1970 to 60 percent.
Eight out of 10 births are well scheduled.
One pair of five has a birth even calculated for a month exactly and if possible in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant year for the birth of the baby.
Repair of the space station
More than seven hours of space work needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to repair a remarkable broken solar panel, necessary for the further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky outlet into the space, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned, and the degree of "customs" that the astronauts spent on repair.
The difficulties occurred on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship presented the Harmony module, a large rolling unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see the framework).
This module is a kind of landing mol for modules-laboratories.
They must be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to move the seven-and-a-half-tune electricity-producing module using the solar panels that had already been on the ISS, so that it would go on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to dismantle the seventy-seven-meter solar panels of the module.
And in that, one of the panels, dissolving as a drawing harmony,as a result of the attachment of the cable, was damaged on the surface of one meter.
The discharge was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were initially intended to perform a check out on the Discovery ship, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a failure, were forced to dedicate to the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go flying to the end of the robotic arm of the ship,added to the arm of the station, and made a repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (spacewalker) of the American Office for Aviation and Space (NASA).
High, stable, very crafty, has a very developed chest and long arms.
At his 46 years of age, this original profession was commissioned by the physician to "operate" a "woven" solar panel.
After thoroughly examining the damages, he cut off the defective cable and fixed on the damaged places some kind of "plate".
He helped him the second "spacewalker", who stayed near the balance room, and also from inside, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, i.e. a minihokey covered with an insulation to prevent the electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "by a kutilsk" produced by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely dissolved and then censored his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Last afternoon, astronauts had a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares are weakening
EADS shares are sensitively losing on the Paris Stock Exchange after the air and defense industry company announced it will have to spend €1.2 to €1.4 billion to face the delay of the A400M aircraft.
The EADS has lost 4 percent and is now at the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production outcomes for 2007 due to the delays resulting from the slow advancement of the engine development of the A400M, which is the condition for the launch.
The price for relieving delays in the supply of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated "on €1.2 to €1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus," the European designer's mother enterprise EADS announced.
Due to these costs, the EADS will be forced to announce a new profit outlook prior to interest and tax deduction (EBIT) on Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Let’s remember that EADS’s production outcomes fell by 86% in 2006 especially due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380.
The group initially predicted the first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The status quo
The Sunday elections will be held without tension expectation: the Russians will majorityly choose the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
So confirming, after the end of the very little free electoral campaign, its tendance to stability, and even to authority.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will communicate to the voters on public law stations a television message, but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is believed to celebrate a tremendous victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president didn’t let anything out of him and satisfied with another attack on the West accused of interference – his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we wish honest, as transparent and open as possible elections, elections without the smallest defect of beauty,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is not the case.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zjuganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, even for Yeltsin."
After the repressions accompanied by the demonstrations last weekend, former world champion of chess Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, has, according to his lawyer, continued to be banned from visiting.
“The Russians remained the Homo Soviet mentality.”
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple tensions, two far more open questions are profiled:
“Who will be Putin’s successor in the presidential office?
The Official Gazette today published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates can be presented to the public until 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot pursue a third mandate in a row.
No followers appear.
“What role will Putin play after March?”
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and all-powered party of the United Russia, which will choose a government and a president?
Whatever it is, the departing ruling power will win on a whole line in parliamentary as well as in presidential elections.
It is tradition.
“The Russians have remained the mentality of the homo sovietica, they don’t feel the lords of their fate,” said Lev Gudkov, the director of the independent Levada center.
Historic Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg notices the time-distant contexts: the civil society has taken, in this country Christian five centuries after Europe, a delay; that famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin followed the paternalist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population by the fact that this new paternalism did not lead to terror, but a certain economic well-being,” believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "voluntaryly give up their personal responsibility," which they proved shortly after the dissolution of the USSR.
“Why to think?”
This phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (from a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) are governed by local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Čeredničenko, a 45-year-old professor: "What to think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?”
loaded memory
After more than 60 years in a secret regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are open to the public.
47 million archive documents stored in a length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were until that time accessible only for “humanitarian” purposes, i.e. individually and namely, at the request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
The 11 archive governments – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this Agreement by all States is over, the opening of yesterday has come into effect.
Sensitive Information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to investigate “especially the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Croix-rouge (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to make these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disabilities of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrests compiled by the Gestap were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced work subjected to civil citizens, bringing them evidence of their internation in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"These documents cannot expect anything fundamentally new," said in 2006 Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Antisemitism at the Technische Universität of Berlin.
India and the EU agree to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India reaches almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expected to sign a free trade treaty in 2008, the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU Foreign Ministers gave the Green to the European Commission to launch negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the ninth trade partner of the EU.
“The Free Trade Agreement is tremendously overwhelming both economies” and “India will get better access to the market for 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
The Asian and European giant together exchanges "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services" annually, said this week Danièle Smadja, the head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regreting that bilateral trade "not yet achieved all its potential."EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Dura Barrosy.

Bank of England announced that it offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England on Thursday said it intends to mitigate the current concerns that the conditions on the credit market will deteriorate again and announced an offer of £10 billion in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that is unusually valid for a long time.
“In order to relieve the concerns that the conditions on the financial markets will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period that starts on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation.”
The bank clarifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the basic interest rate.
It seems that this is the first time that BOE pumps cash to the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
It normally lasts a week.
BOE adds in its communication that it is “ready to take further measures to keep interest rates” of interbank loans on the same level with its basic rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5,829 percent on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has risen to 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been associated with the fees that prevented the banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations strengthened by the currency of the pound to the euro, many preferred the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for the People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to discuss Socialist proposals (PS) on purchasing capacity
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre refused Thursday to discuss the individual paragraphs of the Socialist Bill on Purchasing Capacity, which is equal to the rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the bill was received within the framework of the so-called socialist "nude" (the meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS chair, including an increase in employment premium by 50%, the restoration of the volatile TIPP, the traffic check or the rental regulation.
Since the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was terminated after a general debate which became an opportunity to exchange opinions, sometimes more vivid, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television speech on purchasability.
PS Deputy Chairman Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will submit these proposals again in their fullness in the form of additions to the amendment to the Bill on Finance, which will be discussed by the House next week.
A new festival is born.
As a result of numerous speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is setting up a new festival, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with the Republic Festival by the British organizer Melvin Ben.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration,” said Charlie Jones from C3 on Billboard.com.
The C3 is produced by the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in the state of New Jersey, is the summer destination of the miners.
The festival is scheduled to take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most recognized festival organizers.
In 1989, he took part in the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin added Benn to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owners, is also responsible for production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones from C3 describes Glastonbury as the “most inspiring event” he’ve ever experienced and says his company and Melvin Benna’s company are working simultaneously to give the region a festival event of European style.
“Originally we chose Philadelphia as a market and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to establish a festival in the center of Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“I negotiated with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, because of the current leadership of the city, we have fallen into politics, adds Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Bennem and we are going to establish a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in the Grant Park in Chicago in 2005, after they emerged on the festival scene in 2002 by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both festivals take place in the city.
“The European model of Melvin Benna Festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in the green spaces in the cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two concepts in a certain way so that we create an impression of both the rural festival by Europe and the urban festival by America.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Total Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter named refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, he claims that "they are sufficiently beneficial to allow you to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will have, hopefully, a long duration."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that the groups have already been sent invitations, but nothing can still be confirmed at the time the program is just released in the press.
“Vineland will have a rock breath, but the music there will be diverse, so that we can attract a wide spectrum of spectators as possible,” says Carlie Jones.
C3’s partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize in the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator itself stands against it.
This conviction mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is “politically challenging” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns “runaway productions”.
Is it hard to fall into the “Governator”?
“We need to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he will go there.
Our task is to offer those they will consider the best,” he said.
Hunting for Festivals
For this time, however, the priority of Denis Turcottea is to promote the local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the West Coast festivals, whether it’s festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about presenting Quebec films, paying attention to them and ensuring that the directors provide interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is available in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short films and four full-time films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Will it be a marathon at the exchange at the end of the year? experts split 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remains until the end of the administrative year and investors already take my hands in expectation that the traditional marathon will take place at the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not so sure it will happen.
The Bank Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December is a positive course on the stock exchange."
However, it is not convenient to make forecasts exclusively on the basis of statistics, especially because in the current contexts the markets raise, at least in the short term, certain doubts.”
These experts do not expect the stock exchange to move over the past few weeks of the year, and say that “the stock market isined by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income affected by the effect of turnover to high-quality securities, both in long and short sections.”
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather quiet course, not without volatility, "especially because there is no known impact of the likely fall of the Fed (Federal Reserve System), due to the high level of oil prices and the danger of incentives to inflation pressure."
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time to boldly declare that the marathon will take place.
“There’s not too many reasons for joy,” the expert assures.
Ibex lost 4 percent of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year slightly closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolios reassembly and traditional retirement deposit, which occurs annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different because he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after a prolonged weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The aforementioned analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst of Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical levels and "this is why we could observe the reflection of the index, triggered by U.S. reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis."
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that will take care of bringing Ibex to new maximum quotes.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is a series of strong titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because once this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the contrary, assures that the growth will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sector.
Construction firms will also be able to enrich at this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been regaining its positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be in the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to the increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also be very good, although they are not too represented in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of decline in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the breakdown of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 gained 28.17% back, December saw a 6.68% increase.
We’ll still see if 2007 will be the fifth profit year in order (for now Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it will be able to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred subsidiaries of the Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand, are a big change for the bank.
Similarly for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening time of their branches until 20:30 and open on Saturday from 10 to 20:30.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening time of its branches, has not yet decided to take this step.
Meanwhile, it intends to conclude an agreement with trade unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, though not for the public.
The results of this experience will be crucial for other entities to join this initiative, which supports opening hours of transactions, or not.
This is exactly the purpose of the project that the Popular Bank has set out.
Get individual customers who go to these places for their shopping, small and medium-sized enterprises, businessmen and shops from selected streets, where the opening of branches will happen.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new branches, but only the modification of the already existing.
For this reason, the bank modernizes the branches that it already has in business zones by adapting them to the profile of customers in the individual streets.
This extension of the opening time is supplemented with a different concept of the branch space and a new, more current design in brighter colors.
The business director of the bank, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not mean a big investment, but a greater recruitment of staff, as it passes from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meetings for small and medium-sized enterprises and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel Rivera explains.
Branches were chosen in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera it seems to be a happy choice.
Bank Popular currently has 2,500 subsidiaries.
And another 60 specialized immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also has a very long opening time and open even on Sunday and on holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where a number of its branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivera says.
They have just agreed with Telefónica on the sale of mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco for the first time doubled the value of its rival Anteny 3
We succeeded.”
This sentence expressed yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, his satisfaction at the end of the trade, when he stated that the television he drives,doubled the value of his rival Anteny 3.
Only one thing destroyed his joy: 'What I'm sorry is that it didn't happen because we'd grow more, but because we've fallen less,' he said.
And he emphasized that due to the weak market, “we’ve fallen less.”
Telecinco ended trading with a shift of 2.54%.
This profit moved their losses for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (other 13%) according to Bloomberg data reaches 4 488,88 million euros.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and fell 40,5% since January, has a half value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been assessed is 3.571 billion in the Sogecable case, 2.518,53 million Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is offered because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we will evaluate it in tracking.”
Telecinco last week announced that it is expected this year to overcome a billion gross advertising revenues to become the first TV channel, as Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that provides the group’s advertising.
If the estimated data were actually achieved, this television channel would see an increase in advertising revenues by 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6 % (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenue of the television increased by 0.7 % (630.4 million).
One of the factors the analysts focus on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay-out, which it has so far retained: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even though it is early to make a decision, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always much more.
This year I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, with whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows some fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its Telecinco profit estimates by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to explaining that the expected income growth has stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Anteny 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 Opinions
1 .
Ibersecurities: recommends purchasing both securities primarily on the basis of increased dividend revenues and long-term sustainable potential.
2nd
Caja Madrid: evaluates better Telecinco (collect) than Antenu 3 (hold) due to its 'multiple advantages' and trade growth.
3 .
JPMorgan: in both cases, it is recommended not to exaggerate them because they face ‘like threats’ (the overwhelmed market and the deteriorated economic environment).
Congress approves MiFID transposition from 1 November
In conjunction with the parliamentary talks, which were concluded today by Congress voting on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the draft law, the government submitted a public hearing of a regulation that develops the new law, in order for both to enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party agreed to highlight the efforts of the MPs and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernization of the financial markets while strengthening the investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the individual supervisory bodies of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable the provision of financial consultancy services to both specialized companies and natural or legal persons, and will create a new type of financial services companies (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFI) that connect to securities companies, securities intermediaries and portfolio-managing companies.
Furthermore, the number of operations with financial instruments will be expanded by joining multilateral trading and order internalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stock exchange brokers.
The law also obliges investment services companies to spread on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and methods of risk management, and requires a report of all the operations carried out to simplify the supervision by CNMV.
During the discussions in Congress’s Trade Commission, a number of adjustments were included, among which it stands out that securized claims were considered a “complex” financial instrument due to the high risk for the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the U.S. with high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally designate the functions that may be held by the Bachelor in Economics and Business Management for 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which designates the professional functions dedicated to economists.
At the same time, the Senate included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide products trading and customer acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonized ISC increased by 5 percent to 4.1 percent in November.
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process that is used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using different methods of statistical modeling to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) reminded that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative, and therefore it may not necessarily coincide with the final data that will come to date on 14 December of this year.
"The ISC will continue to remain at a relatively high level"
The second deputy prime minister and economic minister Pedro Solbes said the November increase of ISC to 4.1 per cent is a "temporary figure" but also predicted that the price index will continue to be on a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress' columns clarified that "although this is not a favorable number", Spain's inflation differential to the monetary union is still "more or less" the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not count on such a high increase.
“We expected a value of around 4 percent,” the Minister of Economy said to the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make $42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock crashed in mid-September and had to take emergency loans from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50 percent to £12 billion (16.8 billion).
The bank then managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually decreased over two and a half months by customer uncertainty even though the government offered a hundred percent guarantee for that money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the name of the entity with its trade mark Virgin Money, needs to earn about a quarter of the revenue deposited in the UK banks in the next three years to earn the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known in the UK for its impressive advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to its intention.
The Northern Rock Bank this week marked the offer of the Virgin Consortium, which forms three other companies, as one that prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Totany mayor arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcia city of Totana (from the People's Party) for alleged involvement in corrupt construction practices, which have been revealed this week.
A police officer and a local police officer were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced in May of this year Juan Morales, the current people’s deputy and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to the investigative sources referred to by Cadena SER, could be the ‘head’ of the entire business.
Police continue to monitor the building of the municipality and the construction commission and no further arrests are excluded in the coming hours.
Additionally, the lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect of corruption practices in the construction, which were revealed earlier this week, was charged.
According to Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'People' deputy Juan Morales, who was investigated, was arrested when he left Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to the investigation sources, Morales’s alleged collection of commissions for his signature of a construction agreement with a Galician construction firm, which was overqualified 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono accepted the offer to lead the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, to preside Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the proposal of Prime Minister and Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatera to stand in the upcoming general elections in the head of the candidate list of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the general elections, becomes the President of the Congress.
So this was announced at a press conference by the PSOE secretary for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, after the meeting with Zapater, which took place today in the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief executive of the offer to the former minister justified by saying that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the President of Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would be replaced by Manuel Marin as president of Congress, who on November 15 announced his decision not to candidate for the next general elections and to leave his active political career in order to be engaged in fighting climate change within university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister constantly urged him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He added that just as citizens know who will be the Deputy Minister of Economy, if PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to "transparently" announce who will preside the Congress.
If Bono gains this position, he hopes that he will transform the House into a "home of respect and not of insult or scream" and will "be more and more like the citizens."
“Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where there is no peace and peace to speak is Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate at one occasion has been interrupted 26 times.”
Similarly, he spoke praise words to the current president Manuel Marin and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so that he did not decline to the way he said what his opponents could consider "the greatness".
Climate propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement is subject to miserable persecution, both those who look skeptically to its forecasts and those who prefer other political and social struggles must prove solid cohesion.
And in addition to having a leader of the movement that is the prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why his government’s activity or non-action has contributed significantly to the fact that Spain leads in the European Union to failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spanish as clear as possible what measures he intends to take to slow down climate change.
What companies will be damaged by this, what habits of the population will need to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will need to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who sacrifices himself and who will pay for the planet's rescue.
But such explanations are not expected, nor are we expected.
It is because it is necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one centimeter of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of elections that he was hurrying to refuse it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that it doesn’t cost anything, by pure propaganda, passwords missing any true meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new positions.
And the treaties with the planet; this master so useful for the election campaign, who does not even speak, does not blame, does not demand anything, but is the decoration of the meetings and excites humility.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contracting party and does not require us to ride a bicycle and cool with a wire.
Mayor and local police chief Totany arrested for suspicion of corrupt construction practices
According to the investigation sources, the Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcia city of Totana, the “people” José Martíneze Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the municipality and one businessman in hospitality, for suspicion of committing crimes during the construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the municipality, in the premises in which he is now located along with a number of police officers who also arrived at the Commission for Construction and the City Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Land and Apartments.
These three arrests increased to six, which took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during an operation associated with the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the land suitable for construction, so that there the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the previous election period, could build 4,000 houses.
Furthermore, two other persons were not arrested, but are accused in a shortened proceedings at the Court of First Instance of the city of Totana.
The first six arrested were sent to court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and now the autonomous parliament member for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are being investigated.
Furthermore, his former wife, the owner of a real estate office, registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were charged.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and entrepreneur from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., the director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which the fraud was transferred.
The investigation is carried out by a crime group in the construction of the Operational Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrest, also conducted eleven surveys, mostly in companies related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, in the area, a well-known owner of the company for poultry products, who could serve as a mediator.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia city of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of soil in Totana, which has been overqualified and its project was to double the settlement of the town, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to promoting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and on the Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s edition of the most important Finnish newspapers Helsingin Sanomat (for example, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), referring to what the newspapers printed on 18 November, on the same day that the criticism of Blackburn’s book appeared there by coincidence:
"The contents of the subject of philosophy penetrated into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at a school in the city of Jokela.
The victim murderer, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the educational council responsible for the subject of philosophy, requested on the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical opinion about Platon and claimed that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy at high school.”

One colleague informs about the introduction of the crime of downloading from the internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a criminal offence with a rate from six months to one year.
On the contrary, if you steal in the store a plate at a price below 400 euros, it is considered a mere offence (§ 623.1).
B. If you steal up to €1,000 in the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than the withdrawal (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in struggles than compact exchanges.
Participating in the draft has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code)
Sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious according to § 184.2 of the Criminal Code than the download of a movie on DVD.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is vice punished than the provision of pornographic materials to minors (§ 186).

My caregiver tells me one of his articles about strange research entitled “Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less.”
Or the feelings caused by the monthly salary of employees depend on how much the colleagues earn.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance on the tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernda Weber, the author of the study and the head of the Neurocognitive Exhibition Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The greatest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague wrongly.”
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one received the double, the activation was higher.
I really don’t know if this conclusion requires so much science.
Balkan Prosecutor
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been unpleasantly persecuting the Balkan War criminals from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her term expires by the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main guilty of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladić and former Bosnian Serbs leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are on the list, from which he took the title of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary "Karlin List" (2006, not listed in Spain), which by the pace of a detective thriller follows from Belgrade to New York the work of a Swiss prosecutor in the persecution of refugee criminals and the pressure on the competent states to stretch the network.
What insurance is suitable for me?
The car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident represents a significant expenditure that depends on various factors such as age, state, gender, length of holding the driver’s license, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing an appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurer.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance company receives the agreed insurance amount in a certain amount for taking care of the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of the insurance that is determined with regard to different factors, such as age, state, gender, length of driving license, type of vehicle that is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the likelihood of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons over the age of 25 and women must pay lower insurance fees, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
Similarly, on the basis of the checks, insurance companies concluded that married persons suffer less accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving, and thus the likelihood of having an accident.
The increase in frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must well study the situation to choose such insurance that best corresponds to his insurer profile.
We will show you the most important variable for the choice of that or that type of insurance, which in addition to meeting the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under twenty-five years of age face a variety of disadvantages such as low driving experience and short driving license holding when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are even cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance so that they get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would require the participation of the customer in the payment of the insurance event.
“The part of the payment of the insurance event that the client will provide will be determined in advance when determining the price of the insurance will be higher, the lower the co-participation would be,” explains Luis Noguera, the chief executive of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is the insurance extended to other operators so that the client is insured against damages caused to other persons, but not against damages on his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
the recommendation.
If you are under twenty-five years of age, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance fees in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, malus is an increase in the aforementioned basic rate.
“Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” Noguera explains.
After exceeding the twenty-five-year limit, drivers get it easier when they go to contract insurance, as the customer risk index is reduced to them, thanks to the acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks with a discount.
“Young people can usually not take advantage of the previously acquired experience at the time an accident occurs, and not even when driving,” the director of the European company in Spain assures and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of conduct, when the “newman’s fear” has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is better to negotiate insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies as clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their preferences will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discount of the insurance fee (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their management is more quiet and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford to get the highest discount,” said Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended insurance against all risks with a discount of the insurance fee (which is EUR 150) or insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in case of an accident, but also because it represents a significant cost, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would be the most suitable for us given our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get at AC Milan point, which means eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will match their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro stadium in an attempt to get the point they lack to their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, since for Italy it would mean to be the first and for Scots it would decide about the location.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured progress in the fifth match with a remise in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs another one to make sure that he will not be ahead of Shakhtar with six points, which will play with Benfica, which has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round ends, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where he will first enter the thirteen in the semi-finals, in an attempt to move to the final, which is played on the sixth.
So this group will be closed earlier than the others and the decisive result at the Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both teams will try to fight for victory because the Italians will not want to tactic on the home ground and Celtic knows that after the victory he would be the first and would secure a better place in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could have even a loss to progress if Schachchur doesn’t win, but he can’t rely on it, because with the same number of nine points the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1), but won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so the AC Milan players will try to break the evening to Scots who believe they will get to the semi-finals in the reorganized Champions League just as they defeated them in the same match in the past competition with the Kaká goal in extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 in the basic game time.
Hoping that the "rossoneri" will win will be the Shakhtar, for whom it has the price of victory only if Celtic lost, both for progress to the eighth final and for staying in the UEFA.
Although Benfica is the last and has no chance to continue in the top European competition, she could reach the third place with one victory, so she would play in the UEFA.
20,000 people attended the first Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
Spice Girls started their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) in front of 20,000 spectators since they split in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before starting their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver stated that the re-unification of their group is "beautiful".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video that depicts the history of the band, which caused sensation in the late 1990s.
The Return and World Tour takes place at the same time when they get a new album released by EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the stage decorated with the armbands that their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham, gave them.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him it a few days ago.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he's thinking about the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure in 1998 "for the disagreements between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also revealed its nervousness when meeting with journalists two hours before the show began.
“I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw the world opinion changed, the opinion of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the re-unification of the group, which she solved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “the things have gone well and we all have a lot of pleasure.”
However, a lot has changed since Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver with a special Virgin Airlines.
At the arrival they were waiting for a nurse at the airport.
The five have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
It will be held in Madrid on December 23.
New gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine on the price of natural gas, which increases the risk that the Russian supply of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is conducted by pipeline through Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, Russia will be charged with higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year has reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50 percent more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40 percent more for its supplies from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during negotiations,” Ukrainian economic minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be associated with our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a drastic decline in exports to Western Europe, which led to a sharp increase in prices.
Russia is a quarter of its gas supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a large part of it remains inexploited.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS “must control foreign employees”
The inspector said that the Scottish NHS chambers must improve the inspection of criminal records for non-European employees.
Recommendations from the President of the Supreme Control Office Robert Black came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were done well on the sample of five health agencies.
The President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority was concerned immediately after the June attacks on the Glasgow Airport about staff acquired from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone struck a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a videomost accused of linking to attempts to bomb attacks in the UK.
The NHS Chamber is expected to check foreign staff in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK before his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland to inspect criminal records, it has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Inspectorate says, among other recommendations, that the Commission should be led by the Directives of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with checks in several countries.
"Al we found that some of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not performed regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS in a lot agrees with its own policy of pre-employed checks, but also added: "Our report points to areas in which the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information about the number of foreign staff."
Chairman of BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said it is "very unlikely" that pre-employed controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
“The report suggests that the current pre-employed checks in the Scottish NHS work well and it is unclear what additional value these comments will bring,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities have that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority noted that these numbers will probably be higher also because the Commission had a problem identifying the staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established control procedures in the NHS bodies in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included pass controls, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and directive of pre-employed controls for foreign NHS workers.
Minister of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to deal with this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish government, in accordance with the health committees, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that the best practices appear in the updated directives on pre-employed inspections of all staff – including the foreign – which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division to win film awards

The prizes were also awarded by the star Sam Riley, who until the role of Curtis worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and in the side role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench has been nominated for Best Actress for Thriller Notes of Scandal.
And the bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for receiving the British film on the world scene.
The prizes were awarded in London’s Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis’ journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.

But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously known for the iconic package of the album U2 Joshua Tree, two awards - for best director and for best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - since the film of Julian Temple about singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for Best Documentary.
Viggo Mortensen was awarded the Best Actor for the role of the driver of the Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London thriller The Eastern Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard men, won the Richard Harris Prize for his extraordinary contribution to the British film.
This 50-year-old, including Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming the next episode of Indiana Jones: The Kingdom of the Crystal Head.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, which is named after the film star Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
“People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door to people like me,” he added.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He is my man, the great actor of his time, and I am very honored.”
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by the jury, in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers meet.
The supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia has announced that it has arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities and spiritual and security facilities.
The state television of the largest oil exporter that one of the cells wanted to launch missiles into the country.
Al Qaeda’s sympathizers have led a campaign against the monarchy, the allies of the United States, since 2003, that is, since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report that a cell of eight militants led by a stranger planned an attack on a oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid response unit of a capacity of 35,000 members to defend the facility from the failed al-Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted an internal statement of the ministry: 18 detained belonged to a cell led by a "missile detonation expert" that flown into the country.
He also said that the militants had planned to pass eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were prepared for the murder of spiritual and security workers.
The government encouraged the spiritualists to try more to prevent the Saudis from leaving Iraq to join the al-Qaeda militants fighting with the al-Qaeda armies and the shiite government supported by the U.S., which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider a Kazi.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities coopted many priests in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - supported by the challenges of the al-Qaeda leader of Saudi Arabia Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
“This war was a huge effort by the security forces in the last five months,” the state television spokesman said.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested, which was intended to promote "taffirian thought" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims named unbelievers and disbelievers.
Among the arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate of Venus is a perspective for the future of Earth.
Scientists today announced that Venus could once be a pleasant place for life.
Data from the rotating European station show that the planet is even more similar to the swallowing twin Earth than it was previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are approximately equal and circulate on similar routes, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago the conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could also be habitable.
But the scary greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and lower rotation speed sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to float the pen and is destroyed by storms and winds with the strength of the hurricane.
The findings from the European space agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a varied look at how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the Venus Express mission leaders said: “It is increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, although the planets themselves are quite different.
“Our new data enables us to set a scenario in which Venus began just like Earth, with the habitable environment, billions of years ago.”
Police Arrested ‘Rich Uranus’
A kilogram of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was arrested by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material is being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was an enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
continuously accomplished
Mitt Romney said it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed to a YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters uploaded their queries to a video and delivered them for broadcast to the candidates.
None of the questions broadcast on Wednesday 28 November was as comic as a snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and the answers this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party towards the election next year.
It is unclear how exactly the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time dedicated to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the strongest republican topics.
CNN asked a panel of unresolved voters to turn the rotor when they heard something pleasant: the voter recorded the heights of consent when the candidates talked about a hard approach at the border.
The hardest and longest exchange of opinions occurred between Rudy Giulian, the leading national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who passed forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to cut down the reputation of a man who, as a New York City mayor, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two struggled especially urputently when the respondents asked whether any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal status and a possibility of citizenship).
Other candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, were able to get their little into the mill on this topic.
No one of the two has a chance to nominate, but they are in the game because they started to hit the alarm for immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have approximately the same opinion: greater strictness on the borders, no tolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with the concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertins and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he in the past supported the possession of firearms.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questionnaire asked if the candidates believe every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani, through this, came to the view that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn’t believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another interrogator asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in the first place in the recent Iowa survey thanks to his long-term Christian conservationism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under the pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate, making him laugh.
The struggle is extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee’s growth in Iowa is covered by recent achievements in earning money and the loud joy of Ron Paul during the Wednesday debate.
The two reflected from the bottom because the two wings of the party are still unable to agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very quickly and convincingly with a winning report about the American size on the lips, mocking on both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Workers' Pain
Gordon Brown again found a hole in which he could fall; his way out remains the same.
Although this is a habit for British political scandals, this is not picant.
It doesn’t seem that any orders would be sold, no bills in a Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no non-married fingers were uncovered.
But the barricated Gordon Brown would go around without discovering that a wealthy entrepreneur for four years had hidden a £650,000 ($1.3 million) contribution to the ruling Labour Party under the names of other people, and that the party did not announce it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling for elections and insulted the British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by surveys, there was hope that it would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of formulating it by the more and more funny representative Prime Minister of the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Brown, once feared, changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unhappy rescue of the Northern Rock problem bank has shown weaknesses in management and weak judgment under fire.
The wrongly thought proposals to amend the tax code united companies against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed an unimaginable administrative breach.
Three retired generals launched the rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against the cuts in military spending because they claimed that being commander of the armed forces is part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abraham; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Labourists (and their former internal discipline guard), has already resigned.
Nothing of this means Mr. Brown would irreversibly pursue his end.
Nevertheless, the governments can reach a point of climbing, behind which they find governance difficult.
The people don’t believe and don’t like the politicians, but mostly they will take away their uncertainty when the new party takes over it.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is likely not going to improve anything, and it doesn’t even need to be in office for a long time, this is the disappearance: the state administration becomes a crackdown, the ministers begin to make briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr. Brown’s position is complicated, as he cannot take the position of a new coaster compared to other political leaders.
Whatever he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and the records of the Financial Office are associated with the decisions Mr. Brown made as the Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair's maleries, such as the long investigation of the financing of political parties caused by "values for money", voters can calmly judge that he was.
However, Mr. Brown's discomfort is not as bad as they look.
This is not as terrible as the conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was explicitly deceived.
And the treatment, whatever it may be painful, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The latest discourse around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abraham, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
This may be true, but the decision was not on it.
The laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's procedure but didn't know it was illegal, will be thoroughly interrogated; as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the main labourist seeker of money, who learned about the obsessive gifts in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not in any way involved; there is nothing that suggests that he knew about these pletches, although the main part of the payments took place only after his arrival in June.
He has done half of his work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own party, but he diluted his determination by seeking the proven instrument, the commission to investigate the matter – led by the Bishop in retirement and the judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law is violated, it is a matter of police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no one for six months, and pursue a real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require the labourists who are in the narrow to cooperate with the conservatives and even give up their special financial relationship with the trade unions – a bitter pill for a dedicated party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent advance in the surveys; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to end victory is untouchable integrity and high competence.
card sharks
Does the underlying mortgage crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, naturally the spine plots begin to moisturize enthusiastically around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market collapsed, the predators focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say credit card losses, if other variants of consumer loans were infected from underlying mortgages, could reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clear.
Increases the number of incapacity to refund (with more than 30 days of payment delay) and withdrawn accounts (accounts that the provider considers inexhaustible).
HSBC announced last month that it lost $1.4 billion on the U.S. consumer loans market – also due to non-solvent credit cards loans.
So far is too early to panic.
There are still few accounts and insolvencies.
According to Moody's, the 3.89% insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a whole percentage point below the average.
The worsening rates can be partially explained by technical reasons.
The change in the US personal bankruptcy laws of 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of bankruptcy, making a large part of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of withdrawals) would thus increase regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The industry also shows a good payability rate, which shows how many consumers pay for their debt each month.
And the trust in securities of credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from the research firm TowerGroup predicts that the volume of their emissions in 2007 will be 25 percent higher than last year.
Direct ways to spread the infection between the underlying mortgage crisis and the credit card market definitely exist: when real estate loans are dry, consumers are rather debt through credit cards.
However, credit card publishers are looking more to the cash flow than to the values of the assurances, so the falling prices of homes may not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They can even be beneficial for the loan providers.
The motivation of consumers to pay the mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards is moved up to the list of priorities to pay.
Card issuers can also respond faster and more flexibly to more stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid changes in the prices of guaranteed items.
“It’s not going to be that one beautiful morning we’d just re-evaluate all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s financial chief executive.
Although the risk of explosion in the style of underlying mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower household prices and debt decreases push America into recession, the credit card industry will stand in front of a darker future.
Be careful with the backs.
British bankers acknowledge guilt in Enron case
Three British bankers, who were supposed to be judged for their role in the fraud associated with former financial manager Enron Andrew Fastowe, on Wednesday changed their declaration and admitted guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally denied the guilt in seven fraud accusations, when they had to participate in a financial fraud in 2000 together with Fastow — to enrich themselves for the expense of their employers.
They had to stand before the court in January.
However, during the trial before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. everyone admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, the unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, appeared on top pages for the entire two years that took the issue process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unfinished parts of an investigation started after the Enron collapse in 2001.
The accusations against them in 2002 pointed to Mr. Fastowa that it was the goal of government investigation on the collapse of Enron.
The accusation against the bankers — who took the surname "NatWest Trojan" — claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to establish a fraud together with Fastowa and his former main subsidiary Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in the Enron’s affiliate branch controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a lot of Enron’s fraud that pushed Enron into a spiral to declare bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its share in this branch at zero, but our three British knew it actually had a significant value.
The company under Copper's control bought the bank's share in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for their share in the company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company will pay $20 million for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers were charged with $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others received $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow acknowledged guilt in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently sentenced to six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and one month in a facility in Texas.
All three British men were freed on a $1 million guarantee that ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, went into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or report failing speculations as profitable.
The collapse cancelled thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron's founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their tasks in the company's fall.
Skilling is in execution of more than twenty-four years of imprisonment.
Layem's sentences for conspiracy, fraud and other accusations were deleted after he died of a heart disease last year.
Moscow’s impotence
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel volume for non-stop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, begins at $54 million.
For some of the rich Russians, however, it is small to return.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
"But no one of them is interested in so many places because it's for a narrow family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgie of spectacular consumption in the mammoth exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers have built their stations, hoping that the newly wealthy Russians will attract everything from the mahagon-shaped yachts to the diamond-decorated car wipes for which they will not be ashamed as much as 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side stand.
“It’s a nice car, but against us it’s a fifth and a decimal,” he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.
On the oil waves, money goes into the Russian capital just as it was when Dallas had its days.
“We passed the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans became enormously wealthy and dragged to Europe where they looked at them as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Just like the 1970s and the 1990s, the Japanese became the world’s most prominent consumers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part on this Clondic.
On another place in Moscow this week the luxury industry conference attracted Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the LVMH group chairman, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the Forbes magazine, Russia has 53 billioners with a total wealth of $282 billion.
In addition, the local main Institute in the Center for Economic and Financial Research published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are in Russia 103,000 "secondary" millionaries whose assets in total give $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the limit of the existing minimum.)
“There are hundreds of millionaries in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London Jewelry Industry David Morris.
It was at the exhibition for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women are wrongly arranged, and men are every one for all the wealth.”
When they walked in the evening clothes on Sunday evening in the halls, twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five-year-old Světlana Turovcov described themselves and their clients as millionaries.
“I looked at those cars and I can’t choose between Infiniti, Mercedes, and Porsche,” said Mrs. Yumatov, who wrapped into the brand’s clothes as a veteran of red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a housewife.
The exhibition seemed to be focused primarily on fresh wealthy, brand-driven Russian shoppers who are willing to sit up for several hours in road traffic so they can walk through the warehouse that cryingly blends Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, billard tables on-custom, apartments in Dubai, Gund plysheads and the slopes.
Members of the simple public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44,57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's picture of hand painted blue cabbage in surviving size.
“Naturally, the Russians are more interested.”
And indeed, the sellers here say that the Russians with the old money (according to the Russian scales it is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from the flashing logs to the little-known brands of limited editions that would never appear on the shopping fair.
Even so a few thousand people, whether millions, millionaire ambassadors or simple tourists, flooded the exhibition halls every day.
Some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress sets of silk, kashmir and cotton, wrapped with gold nits, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company sold bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, the chairman of L.A. Connection, which on request adjusts luxury cars, said that he sold three networks in the style of connected chain armbands for Rolls-Royce Phantomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporter the wheel of the car designed for the Russian casino owner, which had a slope covered with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four such.
“The Russian millionaire who wants a wheel of a piston skin or a portrait of his wife from a cubic zirconium, doesn’t have to ride on those wheels yet,” Mr. Karapetian said.
"He will put them in his garage for thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently does not mean anything very exclusive, due to the great rise in the prices of the property here.
"If you bought an apartment three or four years ago in Moscow, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, when no more in cash," he said.
“There are more than you think.”
Those who are not millionaries could at least pretend wealth at the stand operated by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which is engaged in asset management.
The company has raised four red phone boxes of British style scattered with a column of false bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said that his team printed 500,000 false bills for the Millionaires Fair.
The passengers stopped to throw around a crowd of money, or to let their friends be photographed by a mobile phone while resting in the midst of a replacement wealth, or simply throw out a pocket of millions.
“You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a corrupt operation
It was a day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked from the big windows of this restaurant a little healthier and watched an ambulance coming to the white new-English house for two houses below the West Scott Avenue.
A police car soon arrived.
And then another.
"Then I saw the delivery of a court doctor arrived," said Mr Livingston, the restaurant controller.
“At that moment I knew that someone was dead.”
The officials learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an assistant executive director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to the procedure carried out by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked in the house number 212 on the West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Mrs. Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicological tests, whose results may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death, which by the leadership of the New York police sent a wave of sadness.
Mrs. Arroy has been the assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
“She was loyal, robust and working hard,” Mr. McCarthy told Mrs. Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
It was my shield.
He would protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Mrs. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Commission, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11 and had a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for Union District Prosecutor, Theodora J. Romankowa, said the detectives are trying to find out if Mrs. Arroy died from the consequences of unlicensed surgery.
“This is one of the options,” Ms. Walsh said.
“The investigation is ongoing.”
The officials said they arrived at about 3 p.m. at 21 p.m.
In November, they found Mrs. Arroy on the sofa.
She was declared dead on the site.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh didn’t tell if the authorities heard Mrs. Castra.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday, in Mrs. Castrové's house, with a damned pink tree in the front garden and a dalmatine strawing behind, no one answered.
Beside the doors that led to the underground, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" stood in an open garage - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain wheels on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he arrived for the first time after 25 years at the New York Police Department in Newark, Mrs. Arroy gave him an invaluable help in spotting with his new city’s intolerant and harsh political culture.
“She said, ‘You should be careful about this or that,’ she said.
She was there every time I came, and she was there every time I left.
It was shameful.”
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to the strengthening of world stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market hopes that the Federal Bank will try to calm the loan conditions by further lowering interest rates were strengthened by the calming statements of the Vice President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in order after Ben Bernank, the Fed chairman, said that in response to the continued pressure on the financial markets, the managers must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
As part of an obvious effort to calm the irritated markets in the midst of the signs of reviving credit effort, Mr. Kohn said the recent excitement "particularly reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and October."
He added that if increased instability continues, the possibility that the financial conditions of households and companies will further deteriorate will be increased.
Investors see these statements as a sign that the Fed is ready to supply the U.S. markets with additional fresh capital benefits, and a further reduction of interest rates to stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also helped calm Wall Street in the middle of other bad news about the U.S. economy when the sales of apartments in October record-low numbers.
The consequences of the financial misconduct were emphasized by the Bear Stearns investment bank’s announcement that it will cancel 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, as part of a cost reduction due to the compensation of heavy losses caused by the unleashed bet on the provision of underlying housing loans in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2,55 percent, and closed to 13 289,40, while the more used S&P 500 index strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index raised by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6 306,2, with the value of the British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
The German Dax index rose 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased 2.3 percent.
Recently, the credit tensions on the markets showed full strength after the European Central Bank’s three-month cash package auction was borrowed to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the British Bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release over-standard money on the London monetary markets increased with the three-month British interbank loans "Libor" rise after uninterrupted growth since November 12 to its maximum since the end of September - 6.59 percent.
England has to decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
There are two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number six on the pile for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a wider context of nothing less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who has to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds the best on this post in the time borrowed, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help and because the table of Hugo Morris, the chief manager of the English team, begins to fill with applications for the post of national selection, although not necessarily full-time.
The one who will not be put on the sixth place will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and the sport is no longer.
It’s not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over the lower level, sometimes because of the lack of happiness rather than abilities.
Not only in the cricket, the choice is challenging and requires an opinion, which in the end always has to be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if so?
The same could be asked in another area, let’s say that here: John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, both smart young leaders with good education and industry overview, should be raised to the commission – the place is only for one.
Who has to say what level is right for a cricketer when he is not given a chance to fall or swim to the next?
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decision making, but the same is the same as opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must catch the captain's look at the right time, whether he should take a wicket, and the cricketer needs regular chances at the starting positions, whether he should ever make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Taking the view of the selector is more complicated.
For example, in the last season there was a lot better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and overheaded as an artillery.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first class with 33 overwinnings on each.
Chris Tremlett took at the same scratch average only 29, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope in the next.
Whether he will play at the Asgiriya Shah stadium, or Bopara can be just a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or do the career of both, or it may not have a big influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and in the first class he served good performances, five wickets and 40 holidays, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, who is in addition, although in Australia against Australia he recorded twice a hundred points, still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion following today’s training on the Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah’s greater experience over Bopar’s youth.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha he speaks his brilliant and valuable debut Test exchanges at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first class compared to six Bopar, who is, at twenty-two years old, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin overhead.
However, Shah made in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test on Lord's, his home field in Middlesex, just ten runs, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the selectors, when Vaughan wanted to occupy him again for the next match, his shooting seems to take some of the elans that was so obvious in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essential universal has joie de vivre in the bones.
In the cricket field, nothing leaves him, and his behavior outside the field symbolizes a recently overturned four-wheel drive car on the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He walked with slight injuries and probably a shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (as of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his companion who watched it from a distance, to ask him enthusiastically, "Do you see it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-speed sliding climbs on the fields that seem to be suitable for him, effectively distributes and burns out confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is different.
Per this is the true art of choice.
I personally clone to make Bopara get his chance now, but I don’t want to say that Shah won’t excel if, as the Caylon tea sheets suggest, it’s he who will play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work and fight al-Qaeda
The first buses filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday and disappear refugees who received the money or the visa expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight against the armed forces who evacuated them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy for a dozen buses, filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transportation.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Kubaysi, a Sunni doctor.
“Today I’ve returned because of what I’ve seen on television and what I’ve read in the newspapers, because of what’s happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
“They say that Mahdi’s army has ceased to kill people,” he said, meaning the Shiite militia of the militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to break the battle.
Kassim al-Atwani, a thirty-eight-year-old Shiite teacher from the mainly Sunni region of Amarya, returned with his two children because he could no longer obtain a Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaria called him with the fact that the local defence with the support of the U.S. army helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise against al-Qaeda.
He returned to fight.
“On the eve, a few friends called me and told me that there is a militia against al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that he needs me and the support of my boys.
That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many talked about the attractiveness of calming in the capital after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of the local "groups of occupied citizens" who arms in hand alongside the U.S. army defending their quarter.
But more was spoken about the fact that the return was caused by the obstruction around visa and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salam al-Samarraj, one-fifty-year-old father of three children, expressed a loud suspicion shared among the refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Núri al-Maliki has asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees’ visas and thus force them to return.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian murders.
“Everything was okay before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqi citizens to have to return to Iraq,” the Sunni retired said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
A partial reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the sunnites were pushed out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
Fears arise that the sudden flows of refugees will regain sectarian tensions and lead to further struggle.
Little Sarkozy, Good Education
Germany's smallest federal country plays a leading role in vocational education, even excellence in its universities' international focus.
Only in one educational area, Sarja is concerned with the same deficiency as the rest of Germany.
“To a man who doesn’t come from Sarkozy, I explained yesterday after fifty that we’re not any French” – this self-ironic slogan appears on the posters in Sarkozy on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sharjah education system, which is fifth in the education monitoring of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
The universities are traditionally working closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Today, there students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a fairly high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
Therefore, the average number of sardine children is accepted to college – many of them even without high school.
“A professional education system is being used in Syria,” says Axel Plünnecke, IW’s educational expert.
Through the fact that more than a fifth teenager is eligible to study in a professional school, Sarkozy is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarkozy to combine practical and academic education.
Options to study two disciplines are the second best in all of Germany in terms of the population number.
Despite practically oriented education and growing demand, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by a third over the past years.
Therefore, the Sars Ministry of Education has now ordered the universities to create a promotional campaign on engineering disciplines.
“After the first study of Pisa, we have made several reforms in general educational schools,” the Minister of Education said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of maternity school is free - a model that other federal countries take over.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will show only future comparative studies.
During the Pisa study in 2003, the share of risky students decreased from 29 to 20%.
In general, however, Sarasco has not improved as much as other federal countries.
Bears can count better.
And to the disappointment of the Sarsk studies of Pisa do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Sarsk could just score in this area.
The language of the neighbors is obligatory in high schools – even if the inhabitants of Sarsk are not French.
Chávez moves the hours
What you can't see will go hours in Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will move the hours in this South American country half an hour back.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez becomes a ridiculous figure.
The Venezuelan official newspaper that according to the new law, the clock will move by minus four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American state will take this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States forced the world to divide the time zones over hours.
On Wednesday, Chávez also announced that he was interrupting his relations with neighboring Colombia due to the case with the prisoners.
This left nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is the president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the government of Colombia.
"I can't do it because of my self-esteem," Chávez said, promoting the constitutional reform, which the citizens of this oil country must vote on Sunday's referendum.
Through this reform, Chavez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The dispute led to Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with the Marxist rebels on the release of the hostages.
Uribe's decision to "plive in the face" of Venezuela, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain everyone talks about Chávez.
The new mobile calling here triggered the shock: "Por qué no te callas" (Why are you no longer silent?) - this is the phrase that has been downloaded from the internet by more than half a million people.
It was spoken by the Spanish king Juan Carlos, whom at the recent Ibero-American summit the loud notes of this left-wing populist raised so much that he silenced him in this way.
Germans are at risk of lower wages in 2007
According to the forecast, German workers are threatened to lower their real wages this year despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts have justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to the Hanse Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could actually expect to get lower wages than last year.
“The fault is a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax, and an increase in food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomy and Conjunkturforschung (IMK).
The new burden on employees may also be expected in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% for the new year is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should no longer fall into such trouble that it should demand loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspapers quoted this social-democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the food and oil price explosion has prevented inflation to its highest level in the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the price increased by 3 percent.
Venus is the Earth’s Hell Twin
The European Venus Express spacecraft on Venus recorded phenomena that appear on Earth in the winter: flashes in the atmosphere and wind beliefs on the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have known that Venus is blinking.
Now the European Venus Express has brought evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus flows from dark to dark at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, writes in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory of the formation of primary matter, life could be created on Earth thanks to flashes. storms allegedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
“If life ever existed there, it must have been very long ago,” explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
“Venus is the Earth’s hell twin, but it’s a twin,” Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in matter and size, began to evolve completely differently, is the basic question of the mission of Esa.
Since since the beginning of the 1990s, no sonda has been sent exclusively for the purpose of the study of Venus, the launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of the research, which approached several articles in the journal Nature, not only emphasized the uniqueity of Venus in the solar system.
“They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than previously thought,” Esa said.
In addition to already known wind viruses in the North Pole, scientists found a dark virus in the South Pole that turns significantly faster.
This phenomenon resembles the air streams on the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innerest planet in our solar system is almost the same matter as the Earth, and with a diameter of 12100 km it is almost equally large.
This planet, known as Morning or Evening, will circle the Sun in 225 days.
One day on Venus takes 243 days on Earth.
Although the surface temperature of Venus is 460 °C and the pressure of Earth is 92 bars, the scientists find that the two planets were formed under very similar conditions.
However, it remained in the oceans on Earth, while from Venus it was evaporated into space.
While the carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is calling for the end of party disputes for the admission of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
He has indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and calls on the great coalition to end the struggle around the acceptance of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present ourselves outside as a nation that is not united in this matter,” Köhler told the Economic Journal Handelsblatt.
He also expressed understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Al I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
Although the federal president stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, it did not prevent him from supporting Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy against China.
“The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned China’s traditional united policy.
China knows it too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly revealed his disagreement with the acceptance of the Dalai Lama, and was as a result attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier, among other things, complained of the coalition’s “progressive” foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, the German-Chinese relations have deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government canceled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries, according to the SPIEGEL magazine.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the acceptance of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed the position of China.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama showed that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions, which are also located on the territory of China, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar disasters that have broken out in France
Street battles with police, shootings, burned cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar disasters that have exploded in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow into street violence, the Federal Interior Minister calls for.
The barricades burned, the shooters shot the police with a gun. After the severe youth harassment in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is concerned about similar developments in Germany.
“We need to be careful not to create such social tensions that will break up in violence.
We have to take it seriously,” he said in the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young man can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to address the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
“From the Summit on Integration to the Conference on Islam, we record the first achievements.”
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In the past nights, youths and police in the northern suburbs of Paris led to harsh street struggles.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
More efforts to integrate the German government demanded by the Turkish municipality chairman, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to the disruptions in France, Kolat warned of a "imitating effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be negotiated.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migration families, the unemployment rate is "over average".
First of all, it is necessary to provide a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat emphasized: “We must give youth hope.”
But the Turkish mayor added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many youths from immigrant families don’t want to destroy what their parents built here.
He said, “But we have to be careful.”
We need to “power young people quickly to start working and educating themselves.”
The night in Villiers-le-Bel in Paris remained mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter fled over the area.
The authorities three arrests and several burned waste boxes and cars.
Around 1,000 military forces have been deployed for peace since yesterday.
Police will intervene as long as it will be necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburb.
Around 80 police officers were injured in the district of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The next night, the turmoil in Toulouse took place.
The incident was caused by a road accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to the State Prosecutor's Office, the police are not guilty of the deaths of young people.
In the Empire of Angels “Oblak”
Chancellor's reality-distant outcome documentes that the coalition is programmatically at the end and that we can't expect anything more from it itself.
In which country does this chancellor live?
After her pleasant, indifferent, and contents poor speech at the general debate of the Federal Assembly, we must say: not here, not in this country, which it should ultimately manage.
To the regret that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once replied with a very arrogante phrase.
It’s provincial, she said, showing that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Federal Assembly, she visibly showed everyone how much she deserved that regret.
Merkel didn’t feel a real interest, not a sense of problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblak" presented herself: a politician who stands out above others, who escapes into foreign policy and also there expresses herself only cloudy.
Thus, for example, climate protection: he continually praises for the conclusions from the Heiligendam summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And at all, such a carval - so much discouragement would have forgiven the chairman of the CDU even two years ago.
Now it is limited to flat phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
Through this approach, it damages its image of a pragmatic, who doesn’t need to lie, because it solves problems.
But in the empire of the Angels, the "Oblak" are internal political problems a marginal matter.
Child poverty and worries of low wages?
A few subjects on these topics remained.
It is worth noting how often Merkel is overwhelming when it comes to children’s grants.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning to be able to say at least partially the correct phrase.
As soon as things begin to be very concrete, it clopits like in an entirely strange field.
Department of Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, in the case of the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mit Romney, has spread into a sharp discussion - and both now have to worry about the outsider candidate.
The tensions of both candidates are manifested in the first topic.
Mitt Romney predays to his opponent, Rudy Guiliani, that he has made New York "a shelter for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp regrets: "I think his own house was just one such shelter," he replies and prejudices the former governor of Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrants without documents.
Since the Republican base has not yet a clear favourite, eight presidential candidates use these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos filmed by Internet users and sent via Youtube only serve as such help on a key topic.
"This is exactly the policy of isolation that we have allowed Hitler to take power," John McCain predays to his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one promoting the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain does not save his regrets even Romney, for refusing to condemn the tortuous method of interrogation called "Waterboarding", which simulates heating.
Public reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida show that the important topics of the campaign do not include neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture.
The citizenship will be praised whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
So it will show where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“I was wrong at that time,” Romney explains confusedly and asks the party base and the television audience for forgiveness for being a advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is disappointed when he has to express himself to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civil
A day after his resignation from the position of the Supreme Commander of the Army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf made a presidential oath.
This ends the eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Parviz Musharraf has sworn on Thursday and will remain in office for five years.
Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony that took place in the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn that he will respect the Constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as the Supreme Commander of the Army to his secretary Ashfaq Kiyanim, making himself under international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after the unblooded military coup took power, the former general ruled for the first time as the civil head of the state.
By withdrawing from the position of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on 3 November.
According to High Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will abolish the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the West’s demands.
The country’s Supreme Court, which after the declaration of the state of emergency at the beginning of November occupied his favourite lawyers, in the last week rejected all objections on the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern Vaziristan tribal area.
A military spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrocku Returns
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group took their electronic synthesizers again at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival will also include Live 1974, a draw from the band’s most successful period.
They were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists in the performance of three seated gentlemen, who at first seem to just enjoy the dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and, above all, buttons.
Thirty-six-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt is sitting in the middle.
On his left is the seventy-seven-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar.
The seventy-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who focused on the synthesizers, is from the view of the audience to the right.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes of them, of course, a traditional song will be created.
It doesn’t matter to the musicians.
Among the lovers of the krautrocku, the revival of the Harmonia band caused a significant turmoil.
Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it’s definitely not so busy that someone has been painfully missing this band for twenty-three years.
But why could not even the Germans celebrate their still alive legends of the 1970s?
And especially when the musical style, erroneously called krautrock, is valued in England and America more than in its own country.
When in 2003 the music business awarded the Echo Award for the life work to the survivors of the Cologne Can group, the hall was filled with questioning views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the La Düsseldorf and Neu Groups during their speech, the admiration of the viewers no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts sat with them on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
Remembering the Harmonia band unnecessarily we exaggerate the memory, this trio existed for just two years, and even at that time it was far from having the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially they played in the basement of the Berlin Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a gramofon company led by the church.
Rother helped shortly with the Kraftwerk group, but he gained a reputation as a guitarist with the Neu!, which at the time was the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of the municipality who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to go as a nurse.
It was rather a life in such a spitzwegov art being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing body, whose mark is allegedly found in the ash.
A lot of this has been harmonised.
The first album was "Music from Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so quiet and humble, the band suffered financial difficulties.
The collection of roses served not just self-knowledge.
Now released CD "Live 1974" was said to be cut off at a concert in Griessem before a recordly small, barely fifty-member scenery.
Rothera then expressed the desire that the members of the Harmony were expelled and occasionally exercised.
For Roedlia and Moebia, this was a completely dishonest requirement.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended in the esoteric sphere and saved his future with the album "The Burning Heart".
The Cluster band regained in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland took the goal of caring the krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
The Neu! band was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The Body Resurrection of Harmony will take place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
The present will be Brit, Julian Cope, the old bankier and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also participate.
This describes the overall width of the influence of the krautrocku on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group is filled by Harmonia.
Brian Ena’s phrase, accompanied by the most strange sounds, raises up in the hall: “The unique true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are pictures on which the producer is with Harmony in the farmer seat.
The creation of the legend is also contributed by the promoting of other black and white photographs, on which the set of devices is wildly connected by cables.
Three veterans were once again employed by improvisations.
No longer by laying the microphones on the organs and bubbles to get out of the instruments those never heard before self-made tones.
Electronic music is like electronic music.
Three in the technique of the punch.
There is no change in the House of World Cultures.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she screams under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place she sings “Aaaaaaaa!”
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never rock.
The roots would be found rather than in the blues at music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from art and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "68!", is not so far from the truth, but the Harmony will not be left out of peace even now.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly thought on the scene.
Where does music begin and when it ends?
This question will either prepare a person for nerves or allow him to experience passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical.
With the release of the films The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the War on the Balkans appeared immediately.
No one of them is convincing.
The presentation of the films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or are too impressive.
The Hunting Party doesn’t have any actor like Richard Gere.
Good news first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the cloudy background of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere is hit.
Recently, we have lost this most beautiful man of the 1980s from the eyes, not only because he played in many pleasant, negligent roles in well-being female films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the topic of Buddhism, a man will take the taste for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the hunter becomes a hunt (Why must the names of the movies today be so long and confused?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially who Gere could be if the fate and film industry were not so mercyful: a man who, though has his best years long ago, but as a ruins-like monument still retains a certain remarkable charm.
But despite this trumph, The Hunting Party along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinema this week, is just the continuation of the endless series of failure films about the War on the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo shooter, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is praiseworthy that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television ply film changes too soon into shooting and action.
The film will be a lot similar to the Kobru 11 series, though without the highway, but with the war.
In the film The Hunting Party, you can explore why the Balkan War has not yet been able to make a really good film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters, who stand for the "lisha", a Serbian top war criminal, could, in a different time and under the leadership of another director and screenwriter (there are both Richard Shepard) become a new "Apokalypse".
For both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something that the army is unable to do, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the harsh and sentimental cynic presented at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal will also prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can finally be postponed after the reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film will succeed what the NATO, the CIA and all the criminals of the world have failed in the last five years: capturing the criminals and leaving them to the just revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so opposed to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth referring to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a profound human message.
It condemns that Karadzić and Mladić are still on freedom, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they do not engage in persecution sufficiently intensely on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women will attack us the famous Brecht's poem.
It’s about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer’s work table: “I look with compassion on the wombed veins on my forehead, noting: how hard it is to be evil.”
In films such as The Hunting Party, they are just such narrow heads that indicate how difficult it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of the Balkan war.
Recently in these newspapers it was written that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big failures.
One thing can be added: There has never been a good film about South Africa yet.
It’s almost always true: When a star plunges through a crisis area or walks through a mining field, films like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Frontiers of Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio will be created.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close to time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
A lot of the film must seem to be mature – films that are today considered to be a classic Vietnamese work – “The Eagle Hunter”, “Apokalypsa” or “The Eagle Vesta” – were at the time in no way celebrated as masterpieces.
But today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Screenwriters do not have the ability that is needed to tell good stories without mistakes.
“To be or not to be” or “the great dictator” became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn’t know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Per a person should not want to be good when he wants to make good movies.
Per he must form a sarcastically measured artistic view like novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War," he said: "The figure lies only in the fact that some things never change.
“Great cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust criticizes for rejection of the Olympics
The Mayor's withdrawal from the summer Olympics in Hamburg has led to sharp criticism of politics and economy.
Many people want to continue to fight for the arrangement of the games at the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in an estimate of chances.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described this decision as "business unhappy".
No other project has recently raised in the city so much motivation as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, this sports-political enthusiasm would not be able to beined at such a high level.”
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to enter this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed schedule."
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least unrealistic by 2028.
“Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic candidacy,” von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on the candidacy of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
“This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 schedule.”
However, this dream has not yet ended, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) has called von Beust’s statements regrettable.
It makes the impression that Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
“It’s still too early to destroy the chance by calling the plans already in this early stage as buried,” HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The rejection of the application would be contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate, which he expressed at the General Assembly of the General German Higher Education Sports Union.
Von Beust has not announced Hamburg's candidacy to the University in 2015 as a replacement for the Olympic Games.
The University Sports Association of Hamburg just last week nominated for the candidate city.
The SPD in the Hamburg Senate has said it is wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
“The development of the Klein Grasbrook region has been blocked by the Senate for years because it has bet on the Olympics and the building of apartments has been excluded,” SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region still planned the Olympics with the fact that the whole area will later be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused its time in Hamburg a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg collapsed in Leipzig.
It’s not Warhol’s box.
The one who combines the terms Sweden and the wooden boxes does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikeu.
Or yes?
The wooden boxes currently manufactured in Sweden throw dark shadows into Warhol's list of works.
Most of his listed nine-four "Brillo boxes" of Stockholm type are falsified.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" from 1968, the internal research of the Museum of Modern Museet in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo boxes", which in 1995 the Museum of Modern Museet dedicated to the gift of its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - as well as most of the other "Brillo boxes" such as Stockholm, which are on the international art market in circulation.
Previous events are a confused, disturbing chain of art and curator events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-shaped paper box design of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo cartons. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
It was not an artwork, but an exhibition piece.
Warhol also granted permission in 1968 to produce several Brillo bands in Sweden, but they are not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
The then witnesses are now talking about the fifteen boxes that rightly entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were sold at the auctions for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred pieces were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hultens were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
Warhol was three years after his death.
Lars Byström, the senior conservator of the Moderna Museet, explored, in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their cluster plates were painted with the basic color and curved, they were painted with the oil-white colour with a brush.
The 1990 copy structure, on the contrary, revealed that the colour was applied with a painting roll directly on the clay plate without the previous basic layer - in addition, it is an acrylic and not an oil colour.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list," said Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York doesn't make other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies."
Earlier in July, the Authentication Board announced that it will deal with these “important accusations” that were raised in the case of seafood powder boxes.
But the organization still remains silent.
Rebellion in Manila resigns
In the Philippines, rebels resigned in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Glorie Macapagal Arroy.
Rebellion commander Antonio Trillanes, who quoted the president to manipulation and corruption during the elections, told reporters at the hotel that he refused to be responsible for the bloodshed.
Soldiers committed to the government had previously attacked the hotel with a tear gas.
A few hours ago, about two dozen soldiers were fixed in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court because of the murdered 2003 coup attempt, among them was Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with his approximately 30 sympathians.
Military police officers, who were supposed to watch him, obviously fled to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Glorie Macapagal Arroy.
The government's loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The President called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the military’s act.
“People already have enough,” Triallnes said.
“We invite people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, the former commander of the Scout Rangers elite units, said that other military units will join the march within a short time.
The government’s critics called for a large demonstration against the president on Friday.
The government has been accused of corruption for months.
In 2003, the Manil Financial Area became the main point of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroy.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the rebellion broke down after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven times in the Philippines have attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versailles
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent share in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company on Wednesday announced that the average price per share was 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of its capital.
It was previously speculated about the acquisition.
The company continues to expect an increase in its share in Versailles.
The United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After the Berenberg bank increased its share in the company of this Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent, entrance estimates appeared on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had almost 10% share in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications network provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold another 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were purchased by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
Companies discussed marketing cooperations in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a spokesman for United Internet.
In order to take over the competitive Freenet company, the companies jointly established a joint enterprise for SMEs.
On Thursday, United Internet announced that both companies are satisfied with a share of more than 10 per cent in Freenet and will not take advantage of their right to take over another 18.49 per cent of the company.
It is believed that companies are still keeping all options open, especially the possibility to further increase their share in Freenet AG.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on strategic partnership were closed in mid-November.
This for months long and hardly transparent game on Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contractual customers of mobile networks and 1.27 million customers with full or DSL connection.
The United Internet Holding and Drillische have so far held a 6,01% share in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will gain an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
