The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague City Council and the city council in general.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once "tapped" members of the new ČSSD council a little bit about their mastery of the notorious slang that has become established in recent years when the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, the new councils have been left in the dark about what these new terms mean.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know".
"I am rather a newcomer to Prague politics", said Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, when asked about the test of the "Godfather's vocabulary".
But the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"That's the only expression you've given me that I use now and then".
"Otherwise, I'm not much of a slang person".
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year ahead of the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "bull neck", "betray the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, and the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised to participate in the discussion at first but then did not even answer the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the start.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other, I don't judge".
"What is important to me is how we understand each other in our programmes", he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký did not seem to realize in the headline mentioned above that the influential businessman and friend of the former mayor of Bém, Roman Janoušek, was being referred to.
The word "Voldemort" doesn't mean anything to Kaucky, and the only word he could correctly say in the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel", says Kaucký, adding, for safety's sake: "But I know more from the newspaper".
And jokingly, "I guess I'll have to take a language course".
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered as the Blanka tunnel not only by Matador Karel Březina but also by the councilor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý.
But both social democrats also know who Voldemort is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find him and what it means to go to the pastry shop.
"I think it means going to some Prague restaurant", Plachý is pretty close to solving the puzzle, given that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
However, in line with Březina, he claims that he has drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary is his own.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's own resources are used to finance the measures.
"I asked my colleagues, but obviously we don't have that".
"We call each other by our first names, sometimes we use abbreviations or nicknames", says Petr Hulínský, chairman of the Prague ČSSD - nicknamed "Hulda" by his party comrades.
"In school I was called Bříza (Birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", Karel Březina tells us.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and look - it works.
Mr Weinert is a kind "grandfather" to party comrades or less so to the "old man", the deputy Miroslav Poche, who before the elections attracted attention by his party sponsorship activities, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (a famous Czech Lego figure).
The only thing the Social Democrats allow in their internal party language are nicknames.
Hulínský reportedly doesn't like being called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname for the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber-Clipping Rights" is allegedly related to the fact that Petr Hulínský obtained his Doctor of Juris degree from the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and has published a brochure
Women who are branded as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some social characteristics in common.
They are more likely to be older, unable to find work - for example, for health reasons, single and childless.
If one of these women "becomes" a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become a danger to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate".
"Young and healthy women are spared because they help out with work and have children", describes a religious sister who cares for more than a hundred women who have been excluded from their communities in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for that reason, I published a pamphlet to stop the "witch hunt".
There's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso are illiterate", noted the newspaper der Standard, pointing to the dilemma of written instruction.
But the accusation of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they doused her with petroleum and simply set her on fire.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that it was just a coincidence.
According to their version, it was oil that was set on fire, used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "cast out an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by the people here regardless of their education.
The Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Soul-eaters were as dangerous as they are today".
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian president has been very involved in the president himself last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh launched a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, claiming that she was involved in her death and that she would now attempt to kill the president himself through black magic".
"He called in shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and took them to the president's farm in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink plant excrement that was hallucinogenic but also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive their stay at the farm.
Only under international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released.
Bakala tenant: He uses a furnace to heat the house, but still pays more rent
An elderly male employee is leaving the customer center of the company RPG Byty of "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm was a briefcase with three new leases for three apartments: his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is serving time.
All three have just had their rents increased as part of the so-called deregulation.
Instead of 3,500 crowns a month, the son will spend 4100 crowns next year on a two-room apartment with a second-class kitchen.
"And there's not even running hot water in the apartment, and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven", he angrily taps his finger at his son's new lease, which he has a power of attorney to sign.
"But what - I signed", he explains half displeased and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7 when it intends to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just waves.
"One says this, the other that", he makes a grim face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming a major 'laboratory for deregulation'.
After the New Year, most rental properties in the Czech Republic will face deregulation, as their tenants do not yet pay market-based rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already at nine o'clock this Tuesday morning it is packed.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a pager.
"Rent 2011", a special button on the touch screen lights up.
You type in a few words, and the machine spits out a license plate.
We've barely cracked the number "157", and it's beeping on the big display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enter the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair claims, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, the envelopes with the new lease agreements will be flitting into the mailboxes of most tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio in the Ostrava region.
RPG Byty proposes to them in the letters a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for new rentals in the customer centre has been open since 18 November.
"The campaign has been going on for a little over a week, which means it's just the beginning", the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment's hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' housing is a hot topic.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker of the Ostrava-based ČSSD Lubomír Zaorálek raised the issue quite loudly, no wonder the newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want them to have a new floor".
"They couldn't even change their toilet glasses", the man mentioned at the outset says.
So far, the employees say, most of the people waiting at the counter are pensioners to see if they really get the promised rent reduction that RPG promises if they sign the special offer on time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease contract before 15 December will also be entitled to a half-reduced February rent.
But so far, the "deregulation switchboard" in Havířov is far from overloaded with demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 were due here in 2011", the clerks estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites and on its billboards wherever necessary.
If the parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not intended to be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal course of action", RPG states on its website.
"No one goes to court here", says one of the employees of RPG Byty, and a man on the street outside the customer centre agrees with her at least in part.
"I have a pension of 13,000, of which 5,000 is left for food, where should I get the money for a court case", he says.
Then the employee will be unsure.
"Let's see".
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them through the media not to sign and people are still waiting", she said.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year's Day 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rent levels are not even enough to maintain the housing stock", argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty, and - in the opinion of the homeowners - the neglect of the housing stock, which has been criticized by the angry tenants, is the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest EUR 4 billion in the housing units from 2005 to 2010, it is expected to invest EUR 5,2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the Havířov waiting room keeps showing a few red-lit messages.
'The rent increases in 2011 of 15% and less concern 31 200 dwellings, i.e. more than 90% of the dwellings in RPG.'
"This always means no more than CZK 7.50 per square metre per month", reads the LCD screen.
Just 400 apartments in RPG's portfolio increase rents by 38 percent.
'These cases are about the increase in extremely low rents of CZK 19,66 per square metre', RPG argues.
The rent for 2,600 apartments will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents up by leaps and bounds, but will be gradual over four to eight years.
Moreover, the company is making a further commitment: all the income from the rent increase (see diagram) will be put back into the dwellings, mainly in thermal savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
- but these should primarily benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw through it - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten with all the amenities: colorful walls, creative furniture, lots of toys, and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace?
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, whose studios are home to a number of famous Brno buildings, has been counting on the premises for its company's mini-kindergarten from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building.
The company is looking forward to the future, as most of its 90 employees are in the baby boom and the company wants the designers and architects to return to work as soon as possible.
Alongside the possibility of shorter working hours, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees as part of its social programme.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the new legislation is implemented in a way that is consistent with the objectives of the directive.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the Arch.Design staff and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
The financing (grants of CZK 2.8 million) enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be procured and provided for the qualified staff and operation for a period of two years.
After the funding has been used up (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini-nursery at its own expense for a further 3 years.
The preparation of this project took a year, with the help of Economy Rating providing practical assistance in the application process.
The children are cared for by qualified staff on a full-time basis - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, and the kindergarten is open to children of all ages, although most are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only five children are allowed to be present at a time, but several children take turns in the day.
The day care is flexible and tailored to the needs of the parents, and the children of all staff have the same rights in the use of the day care - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children here not only play, but above all they receive excellent instruction - from basic knowledge to preschool education, and they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What is more, the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can look at the children at any time and thus eliminate the stress of late picking up the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relations are also developing here.
Arch.Design thus became one of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programmes.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The local inhabitants nicknamed the house "Bone House" for its organic forms.
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the shed-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures that recall nature and living creatures.
Only when you look closely do you notice that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole facade is even more plastic, dramatic, and the special lighting enhances the brilliance of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and curved shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Wavy wood is used to make window frames, railing, door frames, even viewpoints and ledges.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district, on the busy Passeig de Gracia shopping street, 43 was built by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but he eventually agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló rental house alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner were created and the use of mosaics on the facade was also his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also worked on the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Soon after its completion, the house was given its organic forms by the local inhabitants, who nicknamed it the "Bone House".
Others called it the "gliding house" because of the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is displayed at the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, unique for the time, with drainage channels and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre is already starting to happen with her 45-degree tilt.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes of the day and was not swayed by them.
He obtained the city's building permit to begin construction, but the details he gave about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when the city was finished, the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they demanded a remedy.
The council members also found it difficult to accept the fact that the building with its pillars even entered the public sidewalk.
However, no changes were made, on the contrary - just 15 days after the district requested it, Josep Batlló applied for permission to lease the two highest floors of the building - and it was granted promptly.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
The second floor gallery contained a social hall, while the third floor contained the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building runs up a flight of stairs to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger company could chat comfortably without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
Gaudí's renovation of the house provided it with a rather unusual roof and two more floors, in addition to a new facade.
Gaudí's play with light is also impressive, as are the blue and white glazed tiles that cover the courtyard and the lighthouses.
The combination of these two colors gives all floors of the house maximum light.
He simply applied the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which absorb sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, is open to the public.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only this year, on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the tours were continued, and even extended to other common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
The price of the tour is 16.50 euros, with a 20 percent discount for students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders.
This is more than the entrance fees for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the inhabitants and visit him at home.
Women have different desires than men.
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bed - so mattress and rust make a good bed.
However, these must be harmoniously complementary in order to meet the needs of the particular user.
Many factors play a role in the choice - weight, height, health, and last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior is equally important, where mattresses and rust are subordinate.
Typical example?
Latex mattresses are not suitable in a weekend house where there is no regular heating, as they take much longer to warm up.
In addition, they are significantly heavier than ordinary polyurethane mattresses.
- And they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough vents in the core and are on a solid plate, moisture builds up, so mold can form underneath.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in your choice.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they couldn't sleep properly here".
"For their dislocated shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft visco-foam (a shape-memory polymer) coating".
"I recommend it to people with diabetes, who have a nervous system disorder that makes it difficult for them to receive the 'information' from the joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, a specialist in upholstered furniture.
That is why I have been supplying many hockey players and other customers with these mattresses with visco-foam (memory foam) for years.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by manufacturers such as Tempur, Magniflex in Italy and Tropico in the Czech Republic".
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the heat absorbed, in other words, it adheres directly to the warm body.
Nowhere is it pressing, in the night you do not roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound burns).
When choosing the size of the mattress, the length of the soles of the feet should still be taken into account for body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women who are about six feet tall need a bed that is six to eight inches long.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of bed space available, or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
For convenience and for any visitors.
Otherwise, the rule of thumb for the ideal bed width is: "When lying on your back, there should be enough room for your slightly angled arms", advises Helena Prokopová, the head of the Institute of upholstery and interior design, who has spent years studying the subject of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics and who also lectures on the subject at technical schools.
For a double bed, each person needs his own mattress and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are of equal height.
Otherwise, the only thing left is to mount the grille at different heights, and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, feathered mattresses 15 cm, of which at least 3 cm should cover the mold layer and the fine cushion.
"You must not touch the feathers with your hand or when sitting down", warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and linens like Siamese twins growing together have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses are not ventilated and the mattress cannot be washed, which is already commonplace.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve.
This is another reason why professionals reject advertising that promises mattresses a lifetime guarantee of up to 25 years.
There's a "if" and "but" to everything.
Hence, a practical advice from the vendors: For mattresses that are 120 or 140 centimeters wide, you should not be afraid to hygiene the washable, removable covers, but it is still advisable to use a mattress saver that can be easily removed and washed.
Although today mattress covers are usually made with a circular zipper, so that when opened, you get two halves (very important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation of larger mattresses, especially when done alone, often feels like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do you have a hard disk in your bed instead of a rust?
Get it out!
Or at most, a bed for unwanted guests and for one night.
Even so, they should preferably provide the panel with ventilation holes (if none are already in it) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring cores and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses are not included in such a substrate.
For non-adjustable lattice grates with 14 to 18 spring bars (lamellae), latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut if appropriate) are suitable, always with a larger number of bars, i.e. 28 or more spring bars, with a lordose support in the lumbar region and the possibility of regulating the hardness of the bars.
Adjustable slatted grates do not include spring-loaded mattresses, as they do not respond to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special attachment of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed in or even twisted so as to allow the sleeper's shoulder to sink into place.
Especially for men with broad shoulders, an important thing.
Some mattress manufacturers have even started using soft shoulder zones in "gentleman's" mattresses.
The ladies are also considered - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing springs (Lattoflex) or grilles with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion springs are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, reducing the voltage.
- but if you use a bad (too big and plentiful) pillow for the right mattress and rust, most of the benefits are lost.
Here again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, a 50 x 60 cm pillow, like the Scandinavian pillow, is recommended.
In the lateral position, the pillow (along with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the old straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least mixtures of them.
The new magic word for mattresses is "organic".
Natural oils, such as castor and soybean oil, are increasingly being used to produce polyurethane foams instead of petroleum.
I think all the known manufacturers use soy.
"Organic means mattresses that are made from materials of pure natural origin", explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
You can also enjoy micro-capsules that allow you to smell fresh forest or lavender as you sleep.
Here again, a distinction is made between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves to help the mattress cover absorb heat and cool the body, women use the covers to "warm" them.
Red pepper extracts stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex is comfortable and warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffnesses of cold foams and visco-foams results in multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are.
But a good mattress costs 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually taxed less on value added tax because they are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on mattress and rust is not so easy.
Occasionally, special offers are made by manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco-foam memory hidden in the frame for CZK 11,990.
The second one is free.
It was the Tempur material that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at near cosmic speed.
No wonder they were designed for NASA, because astronauts are subjected to enormous overloads during launch.
Tempur softens in heat, but hardens in cold weather.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns but also generally improves sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as special foot pads designed to relieve the legs and vessels.
Domestic producers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitors to keep their kids in check
Fears for their own children are growing, and more and more parents are considering GPS tracking.
The system, originally designed to locate cars, can locate people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette case, but soon it will be no larger than a wristwatch.
Many people are terrified by the case of Anička, and are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not a case of spying around, but an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases, such devices can be misused, for example, if you put them in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not seen any such cases".
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons", Pilin adds.
He believes that the child should always know what the box is for and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like wearing such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in deliberately dropping things when they don't want to be controlled".
"Even the cell phones initially raised high expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices", says Ms. Bočková.
In their view, it is also controversial whether such a device actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned abductions, the kidnapper almost always checks to see if the child has any electronic devices with him that could be used to locate him".
"Today it's the cell phone".
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also seek them out, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising".
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, a company that provides tracking services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
'The device can be set to indicate the position at certain intervals.'
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available".
"More expensive devices even have a built-in tiltmeter, which means that if you fall and lie still, the device immediately sends a warning indicating your position", says Mr Čech.
He believes that similar services could also be used on smart mobile phones with navigation, with the help of special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices that look like trailers or smaller cell phones.
There's always a chance you'll lose them.
According to Mr Pilin of Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are therefore being tested today.
"The advantage of this is that the attacker does not have to know that it is a surveillance or tracking device.
"Or he may not realize it until after a certain time, giving the police a head start", he adds.
No matter which direction the development goes -- to bracelets or to pendants -- it always uses the same technology as vehicle tracking.
So it's a combination of a GPS tracking function (similar to the navigation in a car) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position.
The army has so many match ropes that you could wrap the whole of the Czech Republic around them but they only last two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of detonating wire, to be detonated with explosives.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already supplied 224 kilometers of match to the army camps.
It's reassuring to know that the military has been providing for 225 years.
The problem is the durability of the ignition cord - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the wire from the joint stock company STV Group, a.s. for a paltry 40 million crowns.
In his explanation for the purchase of this huge amount of wire, the General Staff of the Ministry of Defense of the DNES replied that the soldiers would consume up to 60 kilometers of wire annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (DNES) addressed, this information shows that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaning women.
The Minister of Defence, Alexander Vondra, and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of ignition cords be half justified.
That's the equivalent of 25,000 detonations, by the way.
But even so, these army forces would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is still valid that two meters of match is completely sufficient for training each new professional soldier, then these new purchases have created a reassuring supply for the 225 years already mentioned.
The report also stresses the need for a European strategy for combating terrorism and the need to ensure that the EU's nuclear deterrent system is fully operational.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't know why they buy so many lighter cords from us".
But that's ultimately their decision, they'll know what they need it for".
"For us, the army is a good customer, and we as a retailer want to help as much as possible", says Jan Děcký, sales manager at STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of match by saying that the army would have been covered with this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group says that the lighter cords are only four years old and that police and army pyrotechnicians only have two years.
"If the storage is perfect, the four years mentioned are probably possible", admits one of them, who wishes to remain anonymous so as not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
After the expiration of their service life, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
These tests are not free, but cost extra money.
Another argument put forward by the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445-kilometer detonator wire.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers", said spokesman Pejšek, who told us the view of the Ministry of Defense's buyers.
For comparison, the annual consumption of match cords by police pyrotechnicians clearing World War II ammunition or the Soviet Brotherhood Army has for some years been barely more than 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only the quantities of this ammunition that they can use before the expiration of their service life.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the safety of pyrotechnicians and to make it possible to purchase more modern and reliable lighter cords.
The Ministry of Defence is having a huge problem in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of Warsaw Pact ammunition as the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians contacted by the Ministry of Defence, the Czech Armed Forces will face the same problem in a few years when it comes to the disposal of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition cords, which they have bought so "cheaply" today.
I still have the contacts I made thanks to the competition.
The winning entry in the Small Businessman of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the hotel franchise.
Last year's winner of the Small Businessman of the Year competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story sounds like a movie scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that there was a lack of good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
With the savings he had made from his vacation work abroad and a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-semester college student at the time, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time bothered me, so I tried to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first apartment he had rebuilt to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested all the profits in the house, which he then gradually converted into a 54-bed retirement home.
Since then, in just seven years of business activity, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pitloun Design Hotel.
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other people have already come forward to franchising the Pytloun hotels", says the number one entrepreneur of last year.
"A big part of this hotel licence sale was due to winning the Entrepreneur of the Year competition", Mr Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory has brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and surrounding areas.
"People recognized me on the street, often congratulating me afterwards, and I must say that it was really good", he recalls.
I really recommend that anyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, any exposure is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have been possible.
"I have regular business relationships with some people I met through the competition to this day".
He believes that the fame associated with success also affects each of his employees in a small way.
And there he is at 70.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in being part of something that is universally recognized".
I really don't see this as just a personal success, no, it's the result of all of us working hard".
"My name has only been brought to the fore", says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a calmer year than we had on the farm.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Last year's first prize in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition was awarded to Karel Žďárský, the owner of Farmet.
The jury then praised the efforts he made to build a company from the small tool factory in Česká Skalice that generates hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.
"I can say that this award has encouraged not only myself but all my employees and strengthened our confidence in the fight against competition", says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history, the effort was to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop to rent as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate long to abandon his career in the company he had been employed in and founded his own company to make plastic tubs with a few of his father's comrades.
Soon after, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they had become the largest producer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the competition and its media coverage that it was also brought to the attention of the lay public.
"Not only have our customers become much more aware of the Farmet brand, but our foreign partners have also started to value the fact that they can work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, Farmet was not just about victory euphoria.
The valuation was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 in particular was the toughest year for tool-building products.
The crisis, which was affecting not just citizens but also companies, was reaching its peak when many firms were forced to abandon their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new equipment and technology.
"We couldn't escape this situation either, of course".
"Turnover fell by 40%, we had to reduce production and even lay off workers", explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, the situation was managed and the company was kept in the black, albeit with lower profits than before the crisis.
The company was not willing to make any cuts in one area - its investment in research and development.
"The grant enabled us to build a research and training centre, strengthen our presence at international fairs and win major prizes at domestic exhibitions", says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnover is growing again and with it the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning - but in a calmer atmosphere", Karel Žďárský said.
A poll that clears up with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll for the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the entrepreneurship competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been eliminated.
The dubious winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" poll was the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
This is the decision of more than a third of the less than four thousand entrepreneurs who voted.
The Social Security Administration, for example, demanded a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even though the official could have obtained it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register for checks on social security payers in the future", said Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for ČSSZ.
The aim of the 'Absurdity of the Year' poll is to examine all the regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to remove the nonsensical ones.
This is the fourth time this year that the competition has been organised by the Czech business newspaper HN and is growing in popularity.
If last year there were three thousand people who took part in the vote, this year there were four thousand.
This is not surprising, because there are still a lot of legal obligations which serve only to impede business activity.
"For example, we are ranked first in the world in terms of the number of income tax forms", notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Business Owners of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity has been the proclaimed aim of all governments in recent years.
The Czech Republic, however, has hardly improved in comparison with the rest of the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, down eight places on the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in and is held every year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the final editing of the competition at the end of September.
The competition organiser then selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and invites the public to vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
The Commission has already submitted more than 100 proposals for this year's opinion poll, or 105 proposals for nonsense.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the 'finalists' nominated for the competition are, for example, provisions requiring maintenance vehicles to pay tolls on motorways and expressways or requiring entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to teach every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event regularly attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Business Owners of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, participated in the competition at its peak.
"Where the state throws sticks between the entrepreneurs' legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my aim is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year that today make it unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs to do business", said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create meaningless order in the world are having an effect.
In 2007, the most troubling thing for people was the obligation for entrepreneurs to notify the trade office at their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to travel to an exhibition or fair with a booth.
This obligation was abolished by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second-highest vote-getter in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Labour Office the length of an employee's official travel up to 30 days - was abolished by the so-called Green Card Act.
- And all good things come in threes:
The absurdity of 2009 was the ordinance that required physical therapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was somewhat relaxed by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement was dropped.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sport projects
A new feature of the competition, which is now in its fifth year, is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the environmental impact of their business activities and support socially responsible initiatives", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafon, the mobile operator which is the promoter and guarantor of this competition and the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year's first edition of this special subcategory of the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition saw companies applying for which success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and good enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ widely in the subject matter of their work, their efforts have one thing in common: support and consideration.
This is for example the case for disabled people, personal problems or the health of one's own employees.
Among the 14 finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, was the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper mill in Poděbrady also provides exemplary care for its disabled workers, who make up 70 per cent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of 'Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region', and won third place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in that region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, introducing, among other things, a flexible working time and a reduction in working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also praised the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech producers, supports community initiatives and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We try to recycle as much as possible to minimise the environmental impact of our business and administration", explains its managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústí nad Labem, on the other hand, is concerned about the health of its employees and has therefore provided ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all laptops, encouraged homework for its employees and used cartering services provided by a home-protected workshop for corporate events.
"We also support the People in Need Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company 'Praní a čištění' from the Karlsbader region is also noteworthy, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We give our employees allowances for meals, travel, training and holidays", says Josef Strapáč from Czasch, a construction company from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The responsible company of the year category was automatically entered by all the district finalists of the Vodafon company of the year competition who answered the questions in the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
'If the competing companies' representatives did not answer the questions, they were excluded from the 'Responsible Company of the Year' competition, but not disqualified from the main competition, Vodafone Company of the Year.'
"It is not possible to enter a separate entry for this competition only, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition, the company of the year", explains Karel Goldman from the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in connection with a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate agent Luboš G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
The applicant allegedly tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of claims for restitution in progress in order to assign the land offered in the tender to a specific bidder.
This is Luboš G. He paid half a million for it.
"At this point I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offence of fraudulent schemes in a public competition", Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsen prosecutor's office, told the newspaper "Právo", adding that she could not provide further details in view of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was released by the police.
The way in which he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated about in view of the scant official information.
The spokeswoman of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá referred to Právo's question in this regard, stating that the police had actually made arrests at the Land Fund's Pilsner branch during a public competition.
"It was a client, not one of our employees", she said.
According to Ms Černá, the call for tenders was correctly called 'call for tenders for land transfer claims under the Land Law' and would be held in cases where several applicants expressed interest in the land offered.
'These persons offer, in the context of the call, a higher value of their restitution claims to be paid by the transfer than the declared value of the land.'
"The order of potential buyers is determined according to the claims offered, and then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer", explains the fund's spokeswoman.
Luboš G. evidently had information on who had applied for the invitation and, as he was himself an eligible person, having bought a number of refund claims, he offered to withdraw from the competition to an interested party.
Obviously for a big severance package.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he was carrying such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsen Land Fund in the past.
It was also involved in the case of the former head of the Land Fund, Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in substitute restitution, on which decisions on the location of construction projects had already been made.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. also acquired land from the Land Fund for the construction of public roads, more specifically, at the site where the main access road to the Borské pole industrial area was planned to be built.
Later, he exchanged it very cheaply with the magistrate for a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
The city council had to give in with a heavy heart to avoid jeopardizing the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs are rising by several hundred a month
From January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste water charges and higher rents for district heating and in some places.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas 2 percent and more, water supplies will cost up to a tenth more in some cities, and district heating will be more expensive in some places.
The cost of electricity alone is several hundred crowns more per year.
The strong electricity prices were reduced by all major suppliers, which is due to the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic systems.
Gas is only going to rise moderately in price, but at the very moment when people need to heat most and consume the most.
So here too, we can expect a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger towns are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 CZK more per month for district heating from January onwards, and families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1000 CZK more per year.
In turn, Prague residents face 9 percent higher water and sewage charges if the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, prices in Prague remain among the lowest in the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge increases in rents are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rent control will be abolished from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100% from January.
If anyone disagrees with this rent increase, the company wants to sue them.
The regulated rents still being paid in nearly 300,000 homes are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum Beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, and occasionally a good whiskey, stolen from the father's house bar.
These are the drinks that most often require emergency treatment for Czech teenagers under 15 who have been drunk.
Children who repeatedly have to sleep through their hangover in the hospital are no exception.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who have encountered similar cases in the children's wards of hospitals.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk".
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol", said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief of the pediatric department at the Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"Whiskey, if you can get a bottle of it from the father's house bar, and if not, at least Fernet or vodka.
"The advantage of vodka is that it can be mixed with juice, so it doesn't smell so strong", explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová, agrees with him.
"Most often it's Fernet or rum".
"This is the drinking trend today, especially in elementary schools".
"It was also about Slibowitz, who is taken away from home", Ms Jurinová said.
According to Chief Medical Officer Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the hospital are no longer an exception.
Before joining the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of Motol Hospital, where ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"One girl had to be hospitalized four times".
"Her career began at the age of 12 when she was first injected with 3.5 percent alcohol in her blood, plus a combination of 'ecstasy,'" the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at some dance party at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice".
"The interesting thing was that her mother did not find it strange that her daughter did not come home for 48 hours", the chief doctor remarks.
It is precisely the lack of interest or unbelievable tolerance of parents in their own offspring that is considered a major cause of the growing alcoholism of children.
Experts say that children are not really addicted in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is defined as long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case in these children".
Those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol are usually characterized by a negative family and social background", explains Chief Medical Officer Pelikán.
According to Motol Hospital spokeswoman Mrs. Jurinová, by mid-November about forty drunk children were admitted to the local pediatric department.
However, only cases of severe alcohol intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home by their parents or, where appropriate, the police after outpatient treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink one bottle of liquor in the school bench, there are, in Mr Pelikán's opinion, three seasonal amplitudes that are 100% reliable: Walpurgis Night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of grief over the bad report or because of the joy of the holiday".
"On the night of Purgatory, I also saw seven drunken children in the room at once", emphasizes Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who struggles with a hangover the next day.
The next morning's headaches, caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose, can be treated in the hospital with a fluid-filled infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're clearly better off, because after the 'great' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without any pain anywhere".
"They're just a little confused about where they are", admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes spoiling the patients' mood by listing the costs of the treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed are well and happily worth a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"On occasion, I have used this as a teaching tool, telling the children directly at the visit what their drinking cost them and that they may have to work all summer long to earn the money for one such party", added Dr. Pelikán.
He said that the health insurance companies did not resort to recourse to the recourse to the recourse to the recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recourse to recour to recourse to recourse to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour to recour
Two L-159 training aircraft first in foreign hands - in Spain
Two L-159 light combat aircraft out of five that the Czech Ministry of Defence has replaced with the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It's the first time that machines of this type have been in the possession of a foreign army.
In the past, they were only seen abroad during manoeuvres or flying shows.
The aircraft is the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1 operated by the Czech Army.
The other three are single-seat L-159s.
These are currently preserved in Aero Vodochody, which the broker of this deal, Omnipol, acquired last week.
When she will physically dispatch the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said, is not yet known.
The single-seat L-159 fighter aircraft were reclassified from long-term storage without further investment by the Ministry.
"The two-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its current condition and appearance", Pejšek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army will not have to do without two-seat fighter jets, since the Ministry of Defense signed a $200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four surplus L-159s to a two-seat version.
A new aircraft was delivered to the army in July, and the second is due to be delivered by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to implementing the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are to be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the thing", Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper HN had previously reported that the Spanish Government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport plane and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by Mirek Topolánek's government last year.
The Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender for the procurement at that time, but contacted EADS directly.
The then Ministry of Defence argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 overseas.
The Czech army bought 72 Aero machines, of which it uses only 24, and wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of the Casa planes is also likely to have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission took the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a European-wide tender and not on the basis of a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one is due to land at Kbely Airport within 14 days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than their ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling result of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It's supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can be a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly in men up to 60", explains study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be screened for prostate cancer, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health issues, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients, as well as 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a right index finger shorter than their ring finger.
These men had the same risk of prostate cancer as 19 percent of men with ring fingers and index fingers of the same length.
But for men whose index finger was longer than their ring finger, the risk dropped by 33 percent, and for men up to age 60, by 87 percent.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers mentioned, which are formed at the prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was only briefly aware of the study, but that he did not think the link between finger length and cancer risk had been "fully established".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is covered in snow on a Thursday morning.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly snow-capped, and winter workers have been on the move all night in many places.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 motorway near Brno in the direction of Prague is also "standing".
This was reported by Novinky.CZ dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (ÚAMK).
At mile 91 a truck crashed, at mile 93 two trucks collided, there are injuries in this accident.
There's a couple of cars in the ditch.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks collided here, too.
Drivers should start immediately behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and stop at km 182 at the town of Kývalka.
It's a mile-long traffic jam.
There was an accident on the D11 just before the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself, there is a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, convoys of cars are forming in the Prosek district, and Štěrboholská Street is completely clogged.
The safest mode of transportation is definitely the subway.
The tramways run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff meets.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven express trains due to snowfall.
The problems are, for example, on the Prague-Kralupy or Prague-Beroun routes.
Travellers should be sure to inform themselves about the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně is closed from 11 pm to 5 am on Wednesday.
Most roads in South Moravia are only safe to drive.
Three side roads around Vyškov are completely impassable, snow blows occur in places around Brno and snow-mills are used on some high roads around Blansko.
One of the worst affected areas is Výškov.
Three roads are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too, snowmills will have to be used to clear the snow.
When they'll be ready to move, we can't say yet.
In the Hodonín region, caution is warned in the White Carpathians.
The roads, which for nature protection reasons can only be sprayed with inert dispersions, are covered with snow up to five centimetres thick, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimeters of fresh snow fell, most of it in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters in places.
In the Moravian-Silesian region up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slowly stopping to snow.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which is so far known only by its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are laser-guided to a target within a few feet of the target.
The special 25 mm rounds developed for this rifle, which contain high explosive, function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only on impact with the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That means you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel shrapnel from above can easily knock it out.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier basically does this: he aims at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he gets an accurate aiming point, corrects the angle of incidence, and then he just has to pull the trigger.
"Let's say you measured 1,800 feet".
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires the bullet at a distance of 1,400 feet plus, minus, two or three feet.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The computer and computer maintenance giant announced on Wednesday that 400 women and men will be moving their workplaces from their current office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt, in July next year.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, an additional 100 jobs of the group, which are currently distributed throughout the region, should be located there.
The rental offer was extremely attractive and the large offices in Astro Park were more suitable for the way the employees worked.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had been merely a tenant.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said: "We have found a central location with excellent infrastructure in Frankfurt-Niederrad".
The excellent connectivity to the airport is of great importance, especially for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region yesterday caused joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurt Economic Director Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a "global player" had been won.
He called it "great location awareness".
Fujitsu is a good fit for the city, and the settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city was informed of the intention early on by the management.
"We have of course offered our help to the company", said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have given rise to the rash.
The point now is to prevent a long vacancy in such a prominent position.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative".
The house on the town hall square used by Fujitsu and the adjacent "Little Verticales" were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town ten years ago, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz.
A new entrance to the city was built between the train station and the town hall as a joint project of the city and a private developer, which was criticized both for the massive construction of the areas formerly used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Amadeus Start and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, then still affiliated with Siemens, acquired the properties.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu company describes itself as the world's third-largest IT provider.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu employs far more people in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt am Main, and the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters of office space were rented in the Astro Park office building.
The 20-year-old complex - the name refers to its star-shaped floor plan - is home to the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
Amazon locks down servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
It may be political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The disclosure platform WikiLeaks is coming under increasing attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol wanted list, is said to be in Britain, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks has been pushed off Amazon's servers".
"Free speech in the land of the free", the activists announced via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic cables to cope with the high access rates to the documents.
Wikileaks tweeted further: "Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe".
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped WikiLeaks from using its servers after investigators from Senator Joe Lieberman's office reported, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened to boycott Amazon, the British Guardian reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this action sooner, given the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks", the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, egregious and reckless activities are jeopardizing our national security and endangering lives around the globe", said a statement from the nonpartisan senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material".
WikiLeaks founder Assange, wanted by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is in Britain, and Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has always described the Swedish investigation as a plot by his opponents.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for an assassination of Julian Assange".
The European Parliament has a duty to ensure that the European Parliament is informed of the results of the elections.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to remain hidden.
Hrafnsson was obviously responding to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the man responsible for the WikiLeaks leaks be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on television - obviously ironically - that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a scuffle erupted between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded Secretary of State Hillary Clinton resign if she is responsible for the recently disclosed espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we care what a guy with a website thinks", Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his website".
The American government is now putting the protection of its databases under a comprehensive test.
The White House said the special envoy was the deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism, Russell Travers.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which became necessary after the publication of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to have a review of the ways in which the entire government shares and protects information.
The US government also announced that it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be put at risk by the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to contact them", said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect you if necessary".
The Ice University
The Gelato University near Bologna is preparing ice cream makers for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiers has the largest turnout and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all this ice come from?
From the gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere, or ice cream maker, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making.
The gelatinous man uses a spatula to take the ice cream from the fridge, rub it into the waffle, and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't miss the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-cream university was set up by the manufacturer of ice-cream machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream produced by its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiers has the largest turnout and visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the ice cream shop.
Some people dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just venture onto the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant who wants to do something of her own after years of a nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatino Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is crucial, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
But Luciano also remembers the cream of the national and southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and there is a lot of romance in it".
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano turns the basic ingredients - milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers - into a large blender that uses an electronic program to heat everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cool it to four degrees.
Then he turns on a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white cream, the basis for all types of milk.
Immediately, the lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of the age.
Those who say that ice cream is made "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar bean flour.
Of course, ice cream can be made without a stabilizer, but it must be sold within a day or it will collapse and the customer will bite on ice cubes.
Some variations in the basic mass are allowed.
It's more exciting with the flavors.
For the flavor of ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section or the candy bars at the supermarket.
There's also powder and paste.
"The suppliers will all try to run you dozens of flavored additives".
"But you should just experiment".
Or the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or the ice cream made from the white base, which with eggs turns to yellow cream and with cocoa powder to make all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the students can go to the ice machines.
Luciano has them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also carried out on the fruit varieties.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - that's not necessarily better in taste.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture can bring out the flavor of a gelato, says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice cream is a calculation task: if peach puree is used with a high sugar content, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano brings out a device to measure the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winners use it to measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to do the math.
Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical effort as it used to.
It is not only the machine for the automatic production of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a machine that simultaneously creams the finished ice-cream mixture and cools it to minus-zero temperatures.
Despite all the automation, there are still small problems.
Gustavo, a Brazilian, and his classmates are getting all covered in fruit puree when his oversized blender goes out of control.
"In every course", says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Controllers in the Twilight
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
This is now the complaint of the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well", said Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract for years with the Ilsi lobbying group.
He's paid by corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure that the EU's nuclear safety policy is implemented.
The EFSA rules are word for word identical to ILSI position papers and thus bear the signature of the industry, which is actually controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech has complained of a conflict of interest.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed analysis of the situation in the country.
The Central German Broadcasting Company (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel links between a supervisory EU authority and an industrial lobby, which had been exposed by the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians.
However, EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
The experts working for EFSA are not required to have no industrial contacts.
You'd have to disclose that.
Kuiper admits to his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including on risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that GM crops are currently approved without any animal feeding tests and that the response of GM crops to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, GM maize does in the field", says Then.
He said that current practice is to test only isolated proteins but not the whole genome, which does not give reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" Then asks, accusingly.
Angelica Hilbeck is of the same opinion.
The scientist has been researching in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
The industry in this field, as in the USA and now in Europe, is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
The Commission has therefore decided to extend the scope of the programme to cover the following areas:
Studies critical to business would not normally be published.
"The industry controls the safety research", Hilbeck claims.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell got some, too, about 400 kilos in all.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It was snowing.
The story is that in September the excavators had moved in and started to cut off a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was not the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the multi-billion dollar extension of the railway station.
When construction stopped, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim shell limestone, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in the Eastern Fields, 43 years old.
He's got some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"You can't just disappear".
He exclaims, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy".
When he was sawing one up, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell is too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is a dealer in old stones.
He bought all the ones that were damaged in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground into gravel or disappeared in the landfill", he says in his office, a wooden box that was once a guardhouse.
He says he was insulted and threatened when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the demolition.
And if it does, the most sensible thing to do is to keep the stones in use.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the average 80 kilograms of boxes, which cost between $6.50 and $14 each.
As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of returning it when it is rebuilt.
500 tons had been bought by Rongen, 25 large truckloads.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it's been sold.
They're gardeners, landscapers, house builders.
They came from all over and dragged away whatever the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stumbling blocks have long since been turned into walls or into confines of grass beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special", says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component".
He gets in his SUV, takes a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and dropped out, then biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
It holds 40,000 tons of rocks.
He's been collecting his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest antique dealer in the Republic.
He's braking now.
The snow is painstakingly carved with sandstone.
"They used to be part of the Dresden St. Mary's Bridge", he says.
Elf sandstone, yellow, warm, he's in heat.
"My favourite stone".
There's a path up through the woods.
He points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And then on.
"Beautiful travertine, you know".
The squads used to be part of the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
All over the snow, stones and stories, cannon-stained travertine from Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from St. Blaise Cathedral, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
Rongen is struck with awe when he remembers how the stones were formerly cut by hand and moved with simple bottle-draws and ox carts.
"It would be a scandal if you shredded something like that".
He didn't get rich, especially not in the form of a rock.
But the stone dealer now employs 14 people, and up in the forest a stonecutter, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower, and a gardener have settled down.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the recycler.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There are stones to be saved there too.
Competition for high potential
There's a lot of buzz at the buffet.
16 students are crowding for salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a sort of idea competition, they will be asked to share their ideas about the car of the future with VW developers - and, in the meantime, to get to know Volkswagen.
In the race for the brightest minds, many companies are now engaged in close combat and, like VW, are relying on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates into the classroom as early as possible, before they enter the job market and are wooed by others.
And because universities don't publish reports on their students' achievements, they try to spot and tie in exceptional talent in hands-on projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group is advertising for the talents.
A young lady from the human resources department is handing out pens, rubber bears, and briefcases with VW logos.
She tells the promising young talents about internship programmes and student jobs and shows them ways in the companies.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig is supervising the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with industry and gain experience".
"VW can also meet students, look at interesting candidates and decide who would be a good candidate".
Such cooperation, says Selle, is not uncommon.
It's new that the students are being bullied so offensively.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project", says Selle.
The battle for the freshmen will get even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
They must be able to show off and especially to be able to compete for highly qualified workers.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used for the purpose of the programme.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering positions were left unfilled in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will grow even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the accounting and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is on a talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt where participants must find their way around by GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the United States next year.
The participants can also visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
The selection of participants is made in two rounds.
Only the cream of the crop of the many applicants is flying to the United States.
As the high-potential students in the universities are being beaten and stabbed, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out in the crowd with this race".
"We couldn't do enough with a simple sail".
For talent scouts, Dykta seems to be paying the bill.
"We are still in contact with all participants in a similar operation last year".
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply soon", he says.
In addition to the direct buffering on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises in particular are also very classically on the prowl at trade fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs".
"Somewhere on the Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, human resources manager at solar technology company Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young people.
The company's website currently has 35 job vacancies.
"It's very difficult to fill vacancies right now".
"It takes a lot of time and money", she says.
Another way is to contact university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give us instructions that you can do an internship or write your thesis".
Expensive promotions are not in fashion at the solar specialist.
The company is trying to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large company often cannot provide this", says HR manager Stübe.
Money is no longer the main factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute produces an annual list of the best German employers.
It is designed to measure the satisfaction of employees with their work and work environment and to assess the working environment.
The employee representative is also hoping to get a positive result from the placement.
"I think that candidates are particularly looking for external reviews about a potential employer", she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies seeking to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to the warrior, primarily internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your employees", he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer brand formation within one's own workforce.
"Happiness is the best ambassador".
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they will spontaneously advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with gangs", says Krieger.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
The government in Washington has issued a similar ban, reversing its earlier plans for good.
New drilling off the Atlantic coast is also prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The strict ban, which is to last at least five years, was triggered by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig in April.
Before the disaster, which killed 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this approach are aiming to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
The Commission has not yet made any final determination as to who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf.
The British energy company BP is the focus of criticism, facing billions in claims.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the oil industry is able to meet its obligations under the Treaty.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar are trying to rule out another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which had fallen into disrepute following numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing a fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama announced that he would close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that a more stringent regulation would mean significantly lower production in the Gulf than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry", according to a recent industry survey by consultancy BDO - before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change".
Investments in new production projects would be put off until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogonland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, smells like a gas station: billions of liters of spilled crude oil have destroyed the nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry", the environmental activist reassures the journalists. "You'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today".
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been trying to capture a boy in the water, waving to his chest, with the rainbow-colored water glowing almost beautifully.
You can't see brown oil shale floating under the surface.
She used to collect shrimp here in buckets, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing waters are dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of crude oil spilled into the vast wetlands from a ruptured pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach fish-rich waters.
As you drive through the mangrove swamps, the full extent of the destruction becomes apparent.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat will boil brown broth, and those who dip their hands in the water will pull out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangroves protrude like black licorice sticks, sadly leaving the stalks hanging from the individual palms.
The search for bird swarms, as is common in wetlands, is in vain: As soon as the outer rim is silent, ghostly calm spreads in the former paradise that smells like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare", says Celestine Akpobari gloomily.
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for decades: it was here that the first European explorers entered more than 60 years ago, it was here that the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, and it was here that the Shell Group had to stop production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is prevented from returning to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region, which is three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too unstable to be able to survive.
Every few hundred yards, steel racks rise out of the water like bizarre sculptures.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the marrow.
If such a drillhead breaks apart over and over again, Akpobari says, a constant stream of crude oil will flow into the water.
Experts estimate that over 50 years, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta's ecosystem - year after year the amount of oil that was dumped into the sea off Alaska 21 years ago in the crash of the Exxon Valdez supertanker - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
The question of who is responsible for the continued eco-GMO is disputed.
While Shell Corporation blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting wellheads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
Shell's safety standards in Nigeria are much lower than in other parts of the world, US scientist Richard Steiner told the company in 2008.
In what from a distance looks like an abandoned, oil-smeared workshop in the open, figures emerge from the mangroves, naked and up to their necks in oil.
Under one of the many barrels, some connected by pipes, some randomly scattered around the site, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First, gasoline enters the intake tank through the pipes, then kerosene drips out at the end of the pipe, and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four of his employees produce up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel a day. "That brings us $34,000", or about $22 (U.S.).
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of diesel, which is just under 40 cents a litre, is still outpacing the illegal cooks, who get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that tap into the pipeline network across Ogoniland, which experts say is losing at least 16 million liters of crude oil a day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a tiny fraction of the temporarily interim stock is illegally refined, with the lion's share being filled in by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, in tankers and smuggled onto the world market.
The debate over whether the environmental disaster is more due to the population's own drives or lax production methods, activist Akpobari believes, is purely academic.
"If the oil companies had not been perceived as invaders and had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's livelihood, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries".
The report also stresses that the Commission's proposals are not enough to ensure that the EU's energy policy is properly managed.
That's what's making Michael nervous.
"It's time you guys left", says the muscular oilman.
"The soldiers could be here any minute".
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special forces, they will not face arrest, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who are mainly from the north of the country, want to benefit from the raw material, as do all Nigerians.
"This damn thing has put our country on the dog in every way", says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major safety problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible structural defect in a crashed plane that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas is now suing the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that crashed in early November were apparently much luckier than they had been: The Australian Aviation Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 aircraft during its investigation - and is now warning of a possible design defect.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks in an oil pipe connection, said an ATSB opinion published this Thursday.
This could have led to "catastrophic engine failure".
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the impact of the measures on the market.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which made an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a complaint with an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline will seek compensation for the incident in early November.
The engine fire had dislodged parts and damaged the bearings.
Rolls-Royce put an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
The accident has now forced the replacement of up to 40 engines worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had grounded its A380 fleet for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the engine on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Snowfall in the country causes traffic chaos
Germany in white: Almost all of the country had snow overnight.
Many roads are in chaos, trains and flights are out of order.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter freezes over Germany: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire country is covered in snow on Thursday night - causing traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there are snow coverings of up to six inches [15 cm] thick.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous operation, but was not able to cope with the constantly new snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges of 1.2 metres above normal level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from this morning.
In Saxony, snowfall on the motorways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the Central Meteorological Office, the highest level of alert ever was violet in the Swiss state of Saxony.
Some of the snow fell as much as 12 inches [30 cm], and strong, fresh winds caused some weathering.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there overnight.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police reported major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind led to traffic jams and congestion.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, downed trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and turns are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian town of Saalfeld, an ICE train bound for Munich had to stop.
The 165 passengers were provided with wool blankets, food and drink on board by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds cause numerous flight failures.
In Munich, a spokeswoman for the Flight Information Center said that several cancellations had already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
The winter service is on duty all the time.
Although there are few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still nearly 400 beds available for them.
Many of the accidents occurred on the roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg, Germany, where a truck was caught on a railway crossing because it was stuck on a snow-covered road.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which was closed from Bayreuth to Nuremberg until the early hours of the morning.
A 30-year-old woman also died after crashing her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But the good news is that the snow will still be loose and powdery, and so it will swirl with light gusts.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea is affected by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally as low as minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank wants to part with its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the bank is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
The German Bank has just made its corporate headquarters look pretty: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernised; meanwhile, the bankers have been allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now the financial group is apparently seeking to recoup the renovation costs - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, according to a spokesman for the Financial Times Germany.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We always consider whether it makes more sense to own property or sell it and then rent it back", he said.
The largest German credit institution is thus resigning its registered office after a short period of time.
The Bank had not acquired the twin towers until mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from investors in an in-house fund and then underwent extensive renovation.
The energy conversion project is estimated to have cost around EUR 200 million.
I think a sale would be a good deal for the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, now renamed "Greentowers", at about 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
The spokesman said it was still unclear whether the buildings would be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the death of their friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand remembered the fallen miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been recovered because the security situation in the mine is still precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were dumped underground.
A probe had been dropped into the mine shaft, but had not detected any survivors.
The high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions prevented rescue workers from descending for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddy.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends were commemorating the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth, on New Zealand's South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the fallen miners, 29 tables were set up with helmets, lamps and the names of the comrades on them.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place.
In front of the country's government buildings, flags were flown at half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would "come up from the depths of the earth", New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told the memorial.
"But they never came home".
He couldn't get over his son's death until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was dumped in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' relatives, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial service.
The first explosion on 19 November also killed British and South African miners.
Rescue workers began to put out a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases are removed, the process of cooling the searing temperatures inside the mine will begin, Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does splatter go with art house?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is exploring the boundaries of old genres with his epic warrior "Valhalla Rising".
What audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have had in mind when he made "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and slaughters his opponents in a series with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and tears his enemies' guts out of the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says nothing throughout the film, and the other characters are also easily drawn to a sentence or two or a few excruciating death cries at most.
Otherwise, you will be silent and revel in the eerie hillscape of Scotland, which is the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera trips.
It's nice when a movie has multiple audiences, but it's a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug-dealer trilogy Pusher, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art-cinema fans are likely to be put off by the brain mass and intestines that are splashing around.
Action fans will die of boredom at the latest when, for reasons that are open to interpretation, Einauge sets sail with a band of violent Christian missionaries to Jerusalem and is stuck in a fog for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and remains silent.
No wonder "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is particularly regrettable because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-soaked facade is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has earned some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a rigid plot, it's all atmosphere, a fever dream turned into a movie.
And there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn barely allows him a moment of relaxation and slowly strings his throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that beats against him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy with one eye, who is loyal to the side, keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who, for enemies and temporary allies, eventually becomes a warrior from hell, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only for the already corrupt.
"Valhalla Rising" is a film of mystery that can be hated and admired, to anger, to agitation and to wonder.
It's an experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates River, and the nearest major city, some 20 miles [30 km] away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the reactor that Syria allegedly built with North Korean help in the Quader, hidden in a valley that runs off the current.
According to a briefing by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in late April 2008, the reactor, also called the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - which could be used to make nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, however, the technology of the 1950s is hardly suitable.
The CIA was showing a video presentation using blurry satellite images.
She used computer animation to show where the components of the reactor were before it was destroyed, which she said was a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
She also submitted photos showing the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was said to be about to be put into operation, but not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little is known about the bombing, and the mysteries have become more complex.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, it saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious and only talk about a "so-called reactor", even though they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, and so does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was that he had a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer replied with a slap in the face that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The rubble of the supposed "unused military building" was quickly cleared and the site thoroughly planned.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from the immediate aftermath of the attack from a Member State, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected that as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as it has with the satellite images.
It also denies inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this", Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
The investigation into the case has dragged on unsuccessfully since June 2008 and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the agency", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's Vienna headquarters admits - after all, a serious violation of the nuclear arms ban treaty is in the space overseen by the IAEA.
The key to progress in the investigation is apparently three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and that are still in existence.
The inspectors have not yet disclosed what the equipment is, what its function is or what makes it look suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these sites and has located a building complex near Masyaf on satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or near a military base - the very reason Syria denies the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the United States to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had been tipped off by the US intelligence services to the facilities.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite imagery, that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the Euphrates Quadrant.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities" - uranium enrichment or reprocessing - necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with unenriched uranium.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb would later be extracted from, there are at least plausible guesses on these central questions.
It's also unclear if debris that could hold valuable traces was stored at the three sites.
It's like the hundreds of truckloads have vanished from the ground, and nobody wants to know where the debris is.
The IAEA considers the possibility of the Salzmine al-Tibni, located a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which was investigated by Syria in 1998 as a radioactive waste storage site, unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, orbit footage shows that Syria was conducting earthworks and removing large containers at the three suspected sites after the IAEA requested access.
That may be a coincidence, but it did little to dispel suspicion.
Diplomatic sources also say the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - the effort alone shows how much the inspectors are interested.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had been reassured a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, and that the matter was therefore not of great urgency, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been launching special inspections for a few months now, one of the most stringent means available to the Vienna Atomic Energy Authority to enforce controls.
The IAEA chief, Yukiya Amano, who is supposed to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he is still hesitant.
The risk is high: first, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors, and several of the 35 countries represented there are far from anxious to escalate.
Second, as a diplomat might say, "What if they end up with nothing?"
Love in a Time of War
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on her as-yet-unnamed directorial debut this summer, there's been trouble.
The script was written by her, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
There is not much else known about it - but that is enough to cause concern.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's organizations immediately protested, prompting some of the filming scheduled in Sarajevo to be moved to Hungary at short notice.
The film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women Victims of War wrote to Jolie about the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador for the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no rape camp romances, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims told her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended that Jolie be fired as ambassador, according to the UN Refugee Agency, reports The Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read her script, has after some hiccups granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself claims that she has no political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard to get involved in the Yugoslav conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
The content of the report, however, remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating online, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war broke out and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different than the "rape victim falls in love with torturer" version.
That Jolie's film actually begins before the war - that's for sure.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now, I guess the only way you can make the Hollywood hackers feel better is by illegally posting the script, like so many others before.
Nothing like getting out of here
Tonight's finally going well for the Irish.
Not a trace of sadness.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans are hooting for joy at the crackle of loud music, stamping their feet.
The Bailey pub in south Cork is shaking as table tennis players throw tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups - and hit.
"Beerpong" is the name of the bizarre spectacle, to win there is a 500 euro prize plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer guy, that don't really go together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, distracting himself from the burning question of what the future holds.
His plan is not to gamble in Vegas, he's conducting interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a murky feeling about it", he says.
"It's so far from home and I don't have a job there yet".
After all, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a big, big dream job as an event manager, maybe a good sign", the young man says, smiling.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their fortunes abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving, and it's like the Tanners on the island.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the information it provides.
They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For a small country of only 4.5 million people, a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are correct, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of prosperity and prosperity for the Irish, sadness is once again on the rise.
The economic crisis is particularly worrying for the young, well-educated Irish, who have so far been on the upswing.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was plentiful.
But now three out of ten women and men under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times is full of letters from young immigrants complaining: "Everything is going down the drain in Ireland".
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, leaves and our country loses a whole generation".
"The last one, please, turn off the light".
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a bleak future for her because the government is just a blind man and no longer offers young people prospects.
"They are cutting the minimum wage, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates swing from one unpaid internship to the next.
She says her biggest worry is that she will have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing".
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject in a positive way.
McLarnon organises the WorkingAbroadExpo, a trade fair which provides a comprehensive service on working abroad.
"For those who are just starting out, working abroad is a great opportunity to take their first steps up the career ladder", says the manager.
On his website, he has photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley service, but also a freedom and a pleasure.
What it feels like to build somewhere else, Sean O'Donovan has known for six months.
With nothing left to do in Ireland, the 29-year-old engineer now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction projects in Germany.
They're building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, we'll go to Hannover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his hometown anymore, working extra shifts to pay off the mortgage on his house.
"The situation is a little crazy", he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm practically never in again".
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cool rooms.
The little house is in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, large, expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan and a sister bought the house four years ago for $380,000 - 100% credit.
"It was a crazy time, easy money without many questions", he says.
Is he afraid the loan might go bad?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea, and says: "I have no children to feed, and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over".
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation he often hears at present.
"No one has to go hungry - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel Irish".
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years, he came back and life in Ireland went on, simple as that".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Leave the future open and just see how life is going somewhere else.
He's worked a few years in London, so why shouldn't he and his girlfriend have a good time in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that has been worrying him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's worried it could turn into a farewell party.
"Just not too much emotion", he says, taking a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary".
"Let's call it a going away party, just a little bit, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games".
The Democrat routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is the support for private enterprise.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These are the results of the Latinobarómetro survey, which was carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus reflects the change in opinion in this region.
Two facts stand out in particular in this year's September and October survey.
Firstly, the positive mood in Latin America
The second is the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries along the Pacific coast of South America, the democratic movement has grown strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at about 6% a year since 2002, the proportion of people who support democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend is also evident in Mexico, where the economy is recovering from a sharp slump last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, the same as last year but 25% more than in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34% trust their country's Congress and 45% their government, both levels similar to last year but showing a significant increase from 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to promote democracy.
The fact that this continued during the global economic crisis may be because Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were provided with a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are large differences in sentiment between countries (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread progressive mentality.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more pronounced and violent crime has increased, this is less the case.
For only the second time since the survey began, many Latin American respondents see crime as a bigger problem in their country than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Some 31% say they or a family member have been the victim of crime in the past year, but the figures have fallen from 38% last year to their lowest since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in stronger support for the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents nationally said that the private sector was essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring their country forward, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% are in favor of a private economy), despite the fact that their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents, Brazil has the largest share of the region (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
In contrast, respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries see the United States as the most influential country, with Venezuela taking over in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A voting fool
No one expected the November 28 election in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the campaigners who rushed to the aid of the battered country.
Overcrowded polling stations, multiple votes cast, ballots in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just some of the problems.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom had been left homeless by the January earthquake, were wandering around looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leaders, demanded the annulment of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There were partially violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as "quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious observation by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is supposedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected by-election is scheduled for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rapper Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is declared the winner of the by-election by the electoral authority, this could cause problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, there was a fear of low voter turnout.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to lack of organization.
Shortly before the election, some 250,000 identity cards needed for voting had not yet been distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government to be an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Stealthily into the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her approval rating up 20 points to over 50 percent, the highest since her election in 2007.
But whether you can help her win re-election next year depends on whether Cristina Fernández, who is visibly grieving, is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to direct economic policy after his wife was elected, often drafted budgets that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president and his wife to spend the extra income as they saw fit.
On paper, the Fernández government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27 led to further discord.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists sided with Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which one MP slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it", said the President.
The 2010 budget now extends to next year, giving the president even more room to spend money as she sees fit.
The economy is doing well: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from the unions - push the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was rocked by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be his main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC), which then embellished the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate course?
It has called for private industry and trade union leaders to hold talks.
And according to official statements, the wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth momentum by a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Cristina Fernández wants to bring Argentina back into line with the rest of the world in terms of finance.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for a deal with the Paris Club donors, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused an IMF audit, as is the custom elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step in cleaning up INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after her term ends even without the support of her husband.
If so, it will need the support of the middle class, which has largely had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been shown towards them will have subsided.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly override many of her husband's political decisions.
A small round of applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching closer ties with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70 percent of all eligible voters, went to the polls to elect mayors and city councillors in the five boroughs, a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland.
Ma passed the exam, but only by a narrow margin.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) ran three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
If we had a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the city councils together with the KMT.
The election saw the usual Taiwanese happenings of truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass parades and scantily clad dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
Bizarrerweiser, it's not clear if the shooter was trying to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and cast the DPP in a bad light, which gave the KMT more votes.
China was probably the biggest winner of the campaign.
It is noteworthy that relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also avoided over-inflaming anti-Chinese sentiment.
It was a response to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be assured that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but first things first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was weakened by the imprisonment of former party leader Chen Shui-bian for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was a strong advocate of absolute independence.
But under Tais' reign, a new generation of moderate politicians has emerged and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the working class and youth.
Tsai was a popular presidential candidate for the DPP, as was Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything it can to show that it too is capable of building close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to establish a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires open discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's rapid rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
He said from his cell that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged the pragmatist Su to drop out of the presidential race.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is struggling to pick a potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
The results are poor, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet and local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only partially in favour of rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back now".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding surprisingly won in the category of Newcomer of the Year
When you perform at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album Esperanza in 2008, the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it complies with Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released a maximum of three albums before releasing the album that made him known to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward, and with her vibrant voice and a good sense for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding is easily comparable to 2003's Norah Jones, whose 2003 breakthrough as a jazz singer in this category is the closest thing to Spalding's nomination.
The Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" was also nominated in the instrumental album category, making it a huge success.
Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the Contemporary Jazz category, which is usually more for albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue has received well-deserved attention in the big band category, pitting him against the Billy Childs Ensemble with its chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Octet, whose life album Pathways is a prime example of a bassist as a Democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards feature a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the list are Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestral, opera, choral to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the classical albums nominated are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses' "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos' "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins' "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for a Grammy for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for Deus Ex Machina, Hans Werner Henze for Appassionatamente Plus, Magnus Lindberg for Graffiti and Shchedrin for The Enchanted Wanderer.
Part's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen on January 4 at Disney Hall.
The 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" was nominated in the category of instrumental solo with orchestra.
The L.A.-based composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used Middle Eastern sounds and a lot of North African sounds and rhythms", Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Temecula Mosque wins approval from the Planning Commission
After a five-hour, often heated, public hearing, the local planning committee unanimously approved the construction of a mosque in Temecula.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a Commission statement Wednesday evening, the new religious center will meet local requirements and will be an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others", Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"As an American, I'm proud of that".
"It shows that justice prevails".
"There are few opponents", he added.
"They're just very loud".
"There are wonderful people in this valley".
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and the discussions for and against building the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly split, according to Press Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America", one commenter said.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand".
"America is at an end".
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented with a manufacturer of water filters.
The new mosque, which is about 2,300 square meters in size, is to have two minarets and be about 13 meters high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could make new life possible on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible without the elements previously considered essential to life.
"This organism has two options".
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow".
"This makes it quite special, even though it is almost a kind of 'alien' life form", explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six major elements have been considered essential to life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But scientists found that the bacteria in Mono Lake, California, continue to grow even when they replace phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible", said co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must identify life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study examines microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference that did not include details of the discovery prompted widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planetary systems can use other elements to set off biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' we believe are absolutely necessary for life are not necessarily fixed", explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another", Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she speculated that microbes exposed to both might be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is due primarily to its chemical similarity to phosphorus".
"It makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another".
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently from phosphorus, entering our biochemical system and smearing almost everything", Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the GFAJ-1 to increasing levels of arsenic, and it adapted and grew.
The fact that the microbe thrives better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic, shows that arsenic-based life forms can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives us reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth", says Forster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Other stolen show dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four show dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - went missing on Tuesday when unknown persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van that housed the animals outside a Bellflower Motel at 6 p.m., authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two were found Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are safe", Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition".
"They have been returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore did not give details of the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing".
"We don't want to say anything more", Whitmore explains.
"We're following up on some leads".
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for comment Thursday.
They took their two dogs to a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed, authorities said.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, whom Rickard and Peek were supposed to present at the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, were missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to compete.
Peek told the Times on Wednesday that the other dogs were to compete in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly month-long dog show-to-dog show tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans outside their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a boxing puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window a slit wide open so that the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek promised a reward to anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis, and the animals were implanted with microchips to identify them.
As of Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder's fee would be paid.
The lion roars again after court clears MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially approved the "preparatory" creditors' plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to launch new films and TV shows.
According to Thursday's statement, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so nothing will stand in the way of MGM's relaunch under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually go into effect until JPMorgan Chase has secured a planned $500 million loan to finance the new MGM productions.
The company is currently run by a consortium of investment banks, which is itself bringing in $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM's financial woes and pay off the studio's more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted few bidders and no one was willing to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
It all started over again this spring when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
When MGM officially goes bankrupt in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, receives a $4 million "success bonus".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year and has a yearly schedule of seven or eight films due to be released in theaters in early 2012.
They also plan to produce two films based on The Little Hobbit in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite gift is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video game console, both of which can cut a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in my search for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers -- a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's Law had come into effect, and this year's technology toys are more powerful and at the same time a little less expensive than last year.
And while fewer new toys are coming out with their own website, the most popular of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a wider range.
More and more button-cell toys are coming onto the market, and many include rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (matte, $13, for children 3 and up) are stuffed animals the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when pressed on their stomach.
Once you press it, it's a note. Several times you press it, you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start pushing, you can't stop.
For a combination of song and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher price $60, for children 2 and up) is the best choice.
Based on Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers "Simon Says" alternating moves, and thanks to its novel wheel-locking hinged feet, it mastered the moon walk.
Kids who tested the device used Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you probably remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now it's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for kids 3 and up), with a bunch of question cards that can turn a drive into a lesson, with a know-it-all with a car-reading function as the teacher.
If you're reluctant to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60 for children aged 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children aged 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major overhaul of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older tapes.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for children aged 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children 8 and older). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before time runs out, which is great for an impromptu spelling bee.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you're just going to the toy store for the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more pieces at the Club Penguin Store.
It could be roller skates or a stuffed animal.
The latest head-cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5 and older), is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun sending him through a maze of blocks.
And he's got a lot of stamina.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived in our dog's mouth for a while.
Police operations in China are softening
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped across a city square, checking on his nervous subordinates, issuing orders with military authority and a subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan -- China's tough city police, feared and despised for their indiscriminate raids and penchant for violence -- to impress viewers.
"Just stand up!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them", he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely out of their teens, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants, stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats fitted perfectly on the hair held in blue-and-white striped loops.
"To me, they look average", Mr. Tang remarks dismissively.
"Models are pretty".
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray-green one.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with callousness: In 2009, 50 officials were reported to have surrounded a food truck that was not properly set up and stared at the operator until he packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a district of Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to radically change its image.
Since 2003, 13 women have joined the municipal police force, selected for their good looks, good physique and youth.
They're supposed to give the rough-and-tumble police a softer, more feminine look.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would be unable to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
The critics are right.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce city laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely portray a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death after he filmed them with his cell phone crushing a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and posted on the Internet, describing how to beat criminals without bloodshed.
This year, a watermelon dealer in Shanghai suffered brain injuries after a handshake with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan is scaring the government", the state-run China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over its tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleanup".
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district announced its search for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real jobs or were just to serve as a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with good physique and "harmonious facial features" were sought.
They should be above average height -- over five feet, or five feet, two and a half inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
Officials say the work is too physically demanding for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image", an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then there is temperament and "inner qualities".
"Chengguan women are like flower vases", he said, adding, "but beyond that they have other duties".
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's municipal administration, would not agree with this description,
But he admitted that in China, size requirements in job ads for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same is true of even facial features.
Whether that's the same as good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lame or hunchbacked people here", said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would be bad".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple trays and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn't feel it was sexist to put so much emphasis on her appearance.
"Do I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks, with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the pits, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "Our job is to represent the image of the city".
They say they have no regrets about the short-term hiring, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply scaring shopkeepers off the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol is dealing with about a dozen street vendors who are trying to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bicycle before they are driven away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here".
"We've told you so many times!" Ms. Xu explains to a merchant who had fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the work is more monotonous than tiring.
"It's the same almost every day", explains 20-year-old Huang Jing, a student of leisure marketing.
"It's all routine".
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate merchandise from dealers like their male counterparts.
The only way you can threaten offenders is to report them to your male supervisor.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China often face.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after a rumor spread that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared such violence so far.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officers were patrolling that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had seized a motorcycle that was being repaired illegally on the sidewalk instead of in a garage.
The owner was yelling "Zeter and Mordio".
After a 15-minute delay, the officers, with grim faces, made their way to their vehicles and continued on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Xu Liedong, 40, a coordinator of the men's patrol, stayed behind, turning his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like their female colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go on the verbal front".
"Sometimes physically", Mr. Li explains soberly.
"Most of the time, people start the fight".
The prosecutor won 't press charges against Senator Ensign .
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign aide and his attempts to lobby her husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal challenge to Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, who until the scandal that made national headlines and put his career on hold was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
Senator Ensign's office said he was "very pleased" with the verdict after a year of investigation.
But the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary punishment.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they have been informed by the Department of Justice that the investigation into Senator Ensign has been closed and that no further charges have been filed in this matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was enough evidence to suggest that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents first made public in the New York Times in October 2009 led to speculation that Ensign Douglas Hampton helped one of his campaign aides with lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work, and according to the records and interviews, he took over Hampton's lobbying for them after he was hired.
Since Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was barred from lobbying for a year for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called prohibition of revolving-door lobbying.
According to published evidence, "this appears to be a conspiracy and a violation of the revolving door statutes", says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appears to be very cautious in handling political charges after a series of defeats that were followed by the media with great interest, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrible", said Melanie Sloan, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead defense attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, telling him the department would not press charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to elaborate on the legal arguments he had put to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable going into the details of the talks between the Ministry of Justice and myself, but let me say this: we believe we have made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to close its investigation over a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, alleging that a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Election Commission said there was not enough evidence to prove the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that has long supported the senator, was one of the companies that Mr. Hampton found work with, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An email from December 2008 shows that after the firm promoted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, telling him that he was "knocking on the door" at the Home Office about something.
Mr. Ensign also had a lunch date with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after the airline had terminated Mr. Hampton's lobbying.
When information about this affair first came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his Senate seat, where he had been fourth in the Republican primary.
After being out of the public eye for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the Ethics Committee will follow the lead of the Justice Department and close its investigation very soon.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada", she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them slipped away in the rioting in the courtroom.
In a matter of minutes, they were sending out their accounts of horrific witness statements on Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter posts about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that was on fire.
On Thursday, the highly-watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut, family, will officially end when the judge rules on the death sentence the jury has handed down.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed motions with the court setting out the grounds for an appeal that will keep the courts busy for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense coverage of the trial - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and a widespread, immediate penetration of insurrectionary details, so that the jury was unduly influenced by public outrage.
This objection could lead the courts of appeal to consider whether new technologies make it necessary to introduce new rules in the courtroom.
"As I experienced during this trial, I believe that there is a real danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' lead counsel.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court, briefly rejected the motion for judgment last week, saying that the New Media would be "carefully vetted" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court hearings have found that reporting on famous-infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who allegedly killed his wife, saying that New Media had created a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some people believe that the TV series and feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court appeals, which look at Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication channels from the courtroom, which were unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media on trials that are being watched by the general public", said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut, where his report says it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make trials fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' lawyers are laying out to debate for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defense also alleges, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have had a prior conviction when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, filled them with disgust.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge had mistakenly replaced a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution and that he had exerted undue pressure on the verdict by making the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But perhaps the most interesting is her argument about the impact of extensive reporting on the trial.
In an appeal they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was being discussed by candidates during the gubernatorial and U.S. Senate campaigns.
They argued that the New Media had continually rekindled the flames of emotion about the case.
"This kind of daily swarm of media beeps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom", the lawyers wrote, "has never been seen before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide".
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct reports are more instigating than reports that are slower to return is a technically hostile view that impoverishes reporting on future trials.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts are often faced with the argument that social and technological changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers corroborate that claim.
In their appeal, they cited the Supreme Court's 1966 decision to overturn Dr. Sheppard's conviction based on the reporting and made clear that the New Media requires new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "represents Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century".
Can politeness unite the divided?
After a campaign of swearing and negativity, little civility has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of genuine bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and top congressional officials failed to bring a breakthrough on the big issues that were being dealt with during the so-called lame duck session, the session at the end of a term in which no decisions are being made.
From what you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan point-scoring.
The public meeting of the President's deficit committee on Wednesday was equally civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that masks the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - one demanding from the other a sign of cooperation and compromise, while the other is trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after another partisan war.
The meeting itself and the assessment of the meeting by the participants were therefore limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed in the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health care or neighborhood, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election in Washington was at least briefly mild.
"No question, the tone has changed", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"That's inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions that die again.
And that's good".
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution".
Bush's tax cuts are due to expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of it.
Both sides want to find a way to keep some or all of them, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that they are favoring tax cuts for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After the meeting at the White House on Tuesday, there was increased optimism that these issues could be agreed during the lame duck session and ratified at the same time as the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the "lame duck session" pressing issues may not necessarily lead to permanent party cooperation when the new 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation", he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening between now and 2012 as a pre-fight, or shadow box, for the main event of 2012", he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters who helped form it.
As concerned as Republican leaders may be about their high stakes, they know they have to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and roll back health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing government spending.
The Vice-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in their own judgment, pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes in the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found among the elected representatives of the body, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little scope or sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of bipartisan clashes when Republicans challenge Obama on the state budget, taxes and health care system, followed later by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It's been proven that despite the bias in the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If a confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both sides must pay close attention to the public reaction.
Whoever is doomed to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarisation are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and the congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more consistent 2012 election.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still separate them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy", which passes some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the State Security Service are said to be extorting large sums of money for protection so that they can maintain their expensive living standards in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of the bureaucracy -- what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "verticals of authority" -- takes its share of the money that moves up the ladder.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that he has been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won numerous libel lawsuits against such allegations.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian television station: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty".
> An incredible number of Russians believe their society is corrupt, polls show.
But it is unusual for individuals to be named, as in the Ambassador's report, and it is unheard of for this to be done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government to crime has led some to describe it as 'dysfunctional' and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government", the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'kryshna' (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) that extends through the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervision Authority (MVD) and the Prosecutor's Office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-tiered structure within Moscow's criminal underworld.
"Luzhkov is in the lead".
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level".
"Lastly, the common criminals and the criminal inspectors at the lowest level".
"This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city offers no help".
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow businessmen understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law".
"That is why protection from criminal gangs is not as demanded as it once was".
The memo notes that while the fundraising is extensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay are soon to find their business closed - for one reason or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy memo describes men walking into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats", Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia".
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The disclosure of the US embassy memo, which came late in the evening Moscow time, will certainly cause resentment within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats had called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in the domestic politics of this country", he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know".
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and leafy walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembers the man who built it, the future Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge regime, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to publicly confront people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells the story of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia sentenced a former Khmer Rouge member for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Veng, making it difficult for them to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil".
"It even divides families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla warfare from their base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok attracted the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace deal in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, leading to the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces in 1999 near the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, awaiting trial.
When their patrons stopped protecting them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their arms, the common soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are rooted in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology".
"They grew up with no job experience".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rwandan Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat".
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to trial.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the former leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it has not said whether it will prosecute further acts beyond those four.
This has done little to allay fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that is believed to have killed thousands of forced labourers.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability", she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, also warned repeatedly that the situation would become unsafe if the court charged more suspects, although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with Khmer times means piecing together the broken pieces", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand how everything works".
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's history book for the High School, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Vale Touchak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court", he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will convict".
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are gradually gaining influence", he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a powerful pull here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a pathway covered with shrubbery and covered with plastic debris leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here in 1998 after his death on a rubber pile.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray", she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she would lay a bush of ripe bananas - hoping it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to further stockpile weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will no longer harvest highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional security summit article.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have hit a roadblock last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - according to an official who wishes to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the key outcomes of Obama's April "47-nation nuclear security summit" that excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the former Soviet republic's invitation to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012)".
"This proves to me that it works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How do we keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs out of it and we're not going to sell it to anyone".
"We're using it for research purposes only, that's all".
The European Union is not a party to the treaty, but it is a party to the treaty.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The US government is paying $14 million for these efforts, much of it going to Belarus' research into low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust" that led to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official who works on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dismantle its stockpile by 2012, according to the joint agreement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's gross disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
'Welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus declare that enhanced respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,' it states.
No objection from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights carrying Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in documents leaked by Wikileaks and leaked to the daily El País (by cable), which adds that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being adequately monitored".
In June 2006, after the publication of a Council of Europe report accusing the aid of abusive practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega met.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the Council's report had "hit Zapatero in the distance" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "surprised by surprise", Aguirre reports by cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also told the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges".
In January 2007, the Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to declassify the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating or sensitive information", the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the discreetness between governments", Aguirre laments.
At a March 2007 lunch attended by the US Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and doing what they think is appropriate", he instructed his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments to defuse the tension".
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience shows that the PP will not doubt that the Zapatero administration will capitalize on any indication that it has condoned or intentionally ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government", he stresses.
The child killer admits to complaining about the "stress" of motherhood on the Internet.
The young woman spoke of the child when it was already dead and she had a blog called "Terror in Galician style"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is known as "Muki" on the Internet.
Under this nickname, which she has used since she was a child, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs based on the testimonies of their family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke off their relationship, it was announced that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him run a DNA test.
Soon after, she entered into another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But the content of their messages suggests that their love affair broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work".
"When I told him, he was fine with it, but now he's obviously realizing what it's like to be alone with the boy all day and not be free to do and let do what he wants".
Later, she mentions a text message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or leave me an address to send the boy to".
She complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back".
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only stay until the 19th because I have to report for work on the 20th if I don't want to lose them".
She explains that she'll take her firstborn with her if everything goes well.
"He'll be with whoever he needs to be with, which is me, and I'll never leave him with anyone else but my mother again", a dubious intention, given their bad relationship.
There's another e-mail in July.
As she writes this, the boy who arrived on the island on the first of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is presumed dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other, not".
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes it a little bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day".
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He'll be attending a summer course there, so I'll have less to spend on the nanny".
17th: Memories and grievances.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you're coming".
"Alberto says he's been e-mailing me some videos, and if he wants to, he'll find me, I'm a piece of shit".
On the 30th, another: "The boy is fine, he's going to a summer course to learn Catalan".
There is one from Víctor, her current partner: "He's throwing money at me".
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own MySpace blog, now deactivated, where she called herself "Muki, the Prison Break".
'Terror to the gallega'
The last man she lived with, a sworn hunting inspector, says he feels guilty.
He can't believe this happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mom.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the prison in the Menorca prison to the provincial prison in Palma.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the circumstances of the case, "and she had no intention of harming the child".
She had previously confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and hiding his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecution requested a psychiatric evaluation.

After the significant increase in the number of votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its attention on the general elections, whether they are preferred or not.
The Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, compared with 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - a result of the shift in the PSC's share of the vote and the PP's electorate's binding - continues, PP analysts predict that in the general election the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (of 25) members.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for the PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one member - currently it has three - while ICV could keep or gain one.
If the electoral calendar is maintained, however, the next date will be the municipal elections in May 2011, and even then the PP can be the tongue on the scale to end socialist dominance in four provincial capitals and with its majority in Barcelona city council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the PP agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists neither have a majority nor can rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not inconceivable that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona city council, where it would have to win 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, saw its share of the vote increase in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in the change in Tarragona, where they had governed with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC, and the mayor, Àngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy, who met several times during the last election campaign.
The People's Party also saw significant growth in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and is seeking to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports .
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by the Barcelona Police Intelligence Service were part of the Thai-led jihadist cell that provided passports to various al-Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Movement for Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Laschkar e-Taiba (LET), the latter of which carried out the 2008 bombings in Mumbai that killed 106 people.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, going so far as to assure that Operation Kampai has "weakened" and "thereby impaired" the worldwide counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda.
The researchers believe that during the two years the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy of Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
The European Union has a responsibility to ensure that the terrorist group is not only the only one active in Europe, but also to ensure that the police of other countries are involved in the investigation, as well as the Thai police.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand, in which Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had been in charge of the cell in Bangkok, and had been in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was dismantled in 2009, stole passports from tourists in particular, following the guidelines of the so-called 'International Islamic Front'.
This meant that the documents had to be issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigators have pointed out that no links have been established between the arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, although the perpetrator of the bombing was Laschkar e-Taiba, one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that several thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia via a money transfer company a few days before the attack, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid mobile phone cards, which were later used by members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
PP demands that Mas postpone the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present Artur Mas personally with her conditions for supporting his accession as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are no different from those already proposed during the election campaign and can be summed up by the priority given to economic recovery and the avoidance of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The Catalan People's Party chairman was confident in Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 seats she won last Sunday - a figure more than enough to make her feel indispensable, because the candidate from the CiU, a bourgeois regionalist party, is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting on his inauguration.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to form in the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP.
As for the PPC party chairwoman, she demands that in support of her inauguration, "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on financial equalization between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - be put behind her, and that the CiU party leader even wants to submit it to a referendum.
The two political leaders have in common the desire to streamline the built-up political apparatus of regional administration and to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations for Mas's accession are being worked out by Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat from the PPC.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot nursing home do not rule out that their caregiver killed over 11 elderly people
The officials of the old people's home La Caritat in Olot, Gerona, held a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal activities of Joan Vila Dilmes, the carer who killed at least 11 elderly people under his care during his work.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to prosecute those responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability compel us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution has to accept not only a loss of social standing for not having detected the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but also a large amount of compensation, which is charged by the legal representatives of the victims' families.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was in August 2009 and that he continued to kill since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally but that due to their age and illness, the formalities were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat flatly denied this point, stating that "lack of action could never have been the reason for the incidents".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no evidence of negligence on the part of anyone other than the accused in the proceedings".
The man, already known as the "Angel of Death", admitted to 11 murders the day before yesterday, claiming that he committed the first on August 29, 2009, and killed the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime, where he administered a mixture of different sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff access to the medicines.
The nurse used insulin injections and the sedative cocktail in six of nine crimes to relieve the suffering of dying patients.
But the results of the lab tests will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them from the inside by injecting them with bleach, as he confessed to having done with three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
La Caritat does not believe the nurse's statements, even in terms of the number of confessed murders, which could be more, because Vila had given very different statements in court and it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they turned themselves in for that reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatening gestures by the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The risk premia of the peripheral countries have risen dramatically and European bank shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and that the euro has scarcely gained points, which is a cause for concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market which is recovering as it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, which means that the ECB will have to back down tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many more times in the future.
The Bundesbank demanded that the plan to buy government debt be terminated as ineffective and that all exceptional temporary liquidity measures be abolished, with only one week's unlimited access to be maintained.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended 'at least until March' and the quarterly end-of-quarter unlimited access calls to be maintained to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase programme to continue and send a stronger signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday will be thrown back and if it is stubbornly insisted that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as the ECB meeting in May, when the Bank reiterated that it would not consider buying government bonds and markets collapsed, could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, which provoked another market crash.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was rather weak.
The State Treasury spent only 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points over the whole curve, reflecting a change in market perception, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the debt gap figures for Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The sum is estimated at some 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000 million.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognise the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable under the bailout and help to reduce uncertainty.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the implementation of the new rules on the internal market, which will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 1 January.
Angela Merkel has made her speech more moderate in view of the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister yesterday presented the action plan which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
The reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous regions and in financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation measures.
The Zapatero-Trichet double effect explains why the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we're betting on strong demand that will remove any doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain, applying for a bailout would be a self-sacrifice.
We would have liquidity we don't need, the Treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March, interest rates are extremely high and access to markets would be cut off indefinitely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now it's not just being that counts, it's appearances".
We can do this!
The CEO of Eulen is calling the Vega Sicilia shareholders' meeting at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the Alvarez family, owners of the companies Oulen and El Enebro, does not abate.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest the El Enebro shareholders' meeting, which will be held on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers it "absolutely null".
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal steps for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem willing to give in to his legal battle over control of El Enebro's organs.
He was expelled from the board of directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the board at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which was already registered in the Commercial Register as contested.
The general meeting of El Enebro, called by the judge of the Commercial Court No 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has caused another thunderstorm in the bosom of the Alvarez family.
The summons to the general meeting by the judge is the only legal means of guaranteeing the convocation of the general meeting.
The latest strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to use legal tricks, fraudulent schemes and legal abuse to get the annulled meeting of January 18 recognized", as official spokesmen explain.
This argument is the basis for the subsequent challenge of the assembly to declare it 'absolutely void'.
The same protagonists, who are shrouded in a discreet silence, tried in June to convene a meeting in court, but failed.
In El Enebro, the holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
That is the actual context of the case on which the judge will have to decide at the hearing on the appeal, for which no date has yet been fixed.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are being upgraded with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, their story in this exquisite universe has been one of speed, surprise and success.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep rise during the last seasons, at the final sprint last November, everyone bet on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without wanting to belittle the skills of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that put the Multi Siemens Red Bull in the hands of the team and thus created a winning team has become legendary.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for non-car racing purposes.
This computer program, called PLM, has been used to develop assembly lines in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce or simulate a product or process accurately before it is actually built, so as to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's airplanes and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that using this software in the Formula 1 factory, Red Bull can design and implement the changes and improvements detected in the races and tests "in a matter of hours, almost in real time".
Russworm points out that in 1992 there were on average ten technicians working in the racetracks, who could make no more than three or four improvements in a season.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 highly qualified young people who use powerful computer equipment to perform analysis and any changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was capable of analysing and improving all the components of Red Bull's racing cars, except for the engine, for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are being changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to the real world in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars a Formula 1 team can spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially by journalists, are severely restricted.
Everything that happens in there is top secret.
The staff is 580 people, including the two pilots, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula One hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
The enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts at its service to participate in the racetracks hide other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is zero.
The plant's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, emphasizes that five years ago it was still possible to say that progress in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to victory and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, the stakes have changed, and technology is now 85 percent of success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers because they "are not predictable gladiators".
HP will open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a network of 20 shops, each of 80 to 100 square metres, which Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the 16 sales divisions already in existence in the multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the converted store on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of which are in Spain.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), with Barcelona being the third.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming reopening, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice-chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy behind opening a shop is always the same, based on a local dealer with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies will advise on these and will take over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch).
HP is also responsible for training the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to "optimize customer service and advice for small and micro-enterprises during and after purchasing, even packaging".
The Barcelona shop has a pioneering pilot programme which guarantees the technical problems of HP equipment.
An online service establishes a link to the technical centre in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days".
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro enterprises and private customers, because the large enterprises already have their technical customer service contracts", explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from his rival in three years
Banco Sabadell's CEO, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, believing that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially dismissing a new liquidity crisis and predicting the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he foresees a fall in interest rates, which banks will try to offset by raising fees and borrowing prices.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private customers in three years - a sector that is still in its infancy.
Sabadell has found a way to make the most of the next three years and survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year roadmap in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without the public aid from the FROB but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you take away the customers the bank will lose - which is the big challenge for the bank, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year, it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share among private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers account for more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-13 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has disrupted all the banks' plans.
Sabadell will complete this year its Optima roadmap, which was set four years ago and was initially intended to be three years, but was extended by one financial year due to market conditions.
The customers who leave the savings banks are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a great reach".
The manager expects Spain to emerge from the crisis only "slowly".
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create jobs" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which is punishing interest margins - will abate, the risk premium that banks and savings banks have to pay for their liquidity issues will already be passed on to the price of credit to compensate for falling margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and will put pressure on lending".
"We haven't turned off the tap, but the interest differentials are very high", Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued an order on Thursday to its branch network to restrict the granting of longterm loans and to increase the interest rate differential (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy of "raising fees" but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's strategy is based on organic growth, although the group does not, as always, exclude corporate business.
It is not without reason that he assures us that in Spain "bigger companies are needed".
"Next year, everything will change", he assures us.
It stresses that the capital demand is currently 'enormously increasing' and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into the red.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in capital raises.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary market shutdown, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repurchase agreements and thus avert the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of mergers
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted on not participating in the first phase.
The general director of the Spanish Savings Bank Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, however, assured that the second round would not take place.
'I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. e incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, but rather an adjustment.'
"The majority of the work is done. We may have 13 or 14 instead of 17, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has been very supportive of all the operations".
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the merger process had been completed 'as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timeliness of the process, which was set in the past, not now, in the business plans with Banco de España'.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million in assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically unprecedented process.
Olavarrieta explained that 'there was a series of persistent opinions about the slow pace of the process, which revealed the lack of seriousness and nonsense' because 'the Banco de España urges us to complete the process on time before the end of the year'.
The CECA's Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorousfinancing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world, adding that those who questioned it were doing so "without any deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic climate, we have "no need to worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" process of concentration, which will be completed "as soon as possible".
It also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the ECB's stress tests in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but at the same time it has set conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a twofold response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, ranging from tax cuts for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of temporary enterprises or the abolition of the 426 euro aid for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 per cent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is to be expected that Merkel's position is not a fault of her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is adopting a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the preservation of the long-standing traditions of many of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
Secondly, the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it sounds more like science fiction at the moment - is supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 per cent of the population.
The third is a restructuring of the euro in line with German proposals, which means more macroeconomic controls, strict budgetary management, sanctions for countries that fail to comply, possibly a suspension of payments in some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out of the sleeve of a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel has again taken a clear position in the last few days of October, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to be rescued and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it fuelled the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But their proposal, albeit a little sweeter, was accepted and in the coming months we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union which will make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures must be taken now - the old way of working of the euro will no longer exist from that date onwards.
2013 will be the birth of a new currency area where countries that fail to comply are severely punished, can be forced into insolvency and the private sector must bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must set a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as was shown by Spain during boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be bad at not understanding it.
It's not just about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under those conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turbulence will pass into a quieter atmosphere.
And that we will use the opportunities that are offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of order in one's own house has made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything will change.
The possibility of leaving the euro area, which is full of unreliable countries, is not to be excluded.
In that case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sports and evasion
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos's against Ajax show ingenuity, but not the will to evade a penalty.
The alleged suspension of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has led to much speculation about whether or not it was an unsportsmanlike act and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is common knowledge, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and committed several fouls to get the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as Real Madrid would lead their group, the two players will meet the required penalty in the next league match against Auxerre and thus enter the next round without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate surrounding the case is due to the fact that a team from the football club Real Madrid (which in its anthem pretends nobility and honor and on other occasions had punished its players for similar incidents) played the lead role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
The debate is, in any case, whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a circumvention of the rules.
The damage done to the spirit of sport should be examined in this matter.
The spirit of sport defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of fair play is to prevent the aggressor players from taking an unwarranted advantage of the opposing team.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand by cheating or circumventing the rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not done in secret to avoid a penalty, but it should be as obvious as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and accepted the penalty with joy.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders got from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasised that neither the opponent was put at a disadvantage nor were advantages claimed for the game played, as the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It's not a useful strategy for the next game, either, because the club doesn't have those players.
The advantage is obviously that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it's a long-term, to some extent uncertain advantage, because the team could eventually be eliminated, and the players who do this get a penalty and go into the second round, where they're eliminated with one less card than in the first round because of accumulation of cards.
It is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
Finally, such practices are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which includes strategic decisions to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid a penalty (which would in fact be a clear case of rule evasion), they wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading or escaping punishment.
Although the line between ingenuity and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this case is a clear case of ingenuity.
I have the impression that the controversy arose as a result of two factors: because it involved two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provocative rule transfer.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offering to attract customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar is causing an avalanche of reservations to fall this year on December 16 and 17.
The employee-owned parties are spreading, and they don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, group dinners are also held in the run-up to Christmas, providing oxygen to Barcelona's restaurant and leisure industry, but as a result of the economic crisis, they are launching a price offensive to reach the mass segment of customers: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make the accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order to keep up with this tradition, many workers pay out of pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, the demand for minimum prices is high, says Gaietà Farràs, chairman of the Barcelona Restaurant Association.
The representative of the umbrella association has not yet dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think twice before they book".
"They want to go out, but they are very pricey", he says.
Business will be good with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service", he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euros are the most demanded.
A survey of several downtown restaurants shows that the evening of December 17th led to the collapse of the restaurant chain.
The Soteras Group says demand for this Friday's offer will be booming with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, and the group has adapted its menus to the economic situation with full-service offers between 25 and 35 euros.
Another leading group, Andilana, which operates 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has had its own calendar, which has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros", he explains.
AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and 23 stores in total, is not losing its optimism after a second quarter of revenue recovery and a good outlook for Christmas sales, although concentrated on a few days.
Sources at the company point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
The six group menus have been supplemented by a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more as a price hit, giving the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and want more details in return, such as cava.
In some companies, green shoots are also being seen sprouting, which is why the employees are invited back, giving the impression that the group meals are back on the rise.
On the other hand, the vice-president of the association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Barcelona Association of Pubs, Restaurants and Leisure) Enric Gomà is confident that this is the end of the tunnel and notes that the bookings are overall quite "vivid" although the customers "put out a maximum".
But the fun of the party didn't go away, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a major concern in the United States.
Islamabad is building nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
WikiLeaks leaks confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous concerns Washington has about Pakistan's nuclear program.
Beyond the revealing and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited US diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not increasing but on the contrary "decreasing", and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but are stored in their individual parts to make it more difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is causing sleepless nights in Washington.
In a report prepared for the visit of former National Security Council chief James Jones, the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed the following risks: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area under attack by the Taliban, the probable dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is no longer seen as a cause for alarm by the United States alone but also by Russia.
"Pakistan needs to hire hard-core personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; because of the low levels of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit individuals involved in nuclear or missile programs", said Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
What's new about the documentation leaked by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that the cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is declining and the pace at which Pakistan is building nuclear weapons is increasing.
In May, an embassy office described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating": "There is often a lack of transparency; we do not receive responses to offers of assistance or they are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a government intelligence official for South Asia, confirmed that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is building nuclear weapons at a rate no other country is able to".
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to "clarify" to the official during a visit by the Supreme Commander, General Ashfaq Kayani, that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support for terrorist groups".
In the hunt for the WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further disclosures.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track down and track down Assange.
Everything that has to do with WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated maze in which the facts are difficult to unravel.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red alert" to "find and prosecute" Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new. It's from November 20th.
It has nothing to do with the recent leak of over four million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The lawyer for the WikiLeaks founder, Mark Stephens, also said that "the police would know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
The International Police Authority, based in Lyon, France, issued the order on 20 December at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had received the authorization.
The 188 countries of Interpol are instructed to identify and locate Assange, "in order to arrest him and extradite him".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual who has been subject to a red alert, many member countries consider the red alert a waiver for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case in Sweden and the UK, where Assange is believed to be held.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who issued a letter informing them that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested permission to leave Sweden and was granted permission by the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal pursuit", the letter charged.
While the world searches for him - and his mother from Australia insists her son is innocent - Assange is in an unknown location, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave a Skype interview to the editor of Time magazine from an undisclosed location, in which he asked for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN, in violation of international agreements signed by the US, she should resign", he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called his resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing further leaks.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to turn a blind eye to Assange is contrary to the opinions being voiced by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee in January, has asked the State Department to consider putting WikiLeaks on a list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports or contributes to them".
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further and had to retract his statement that Assange must be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and use a drone or something".
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever leaked information to the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is too lenient a punishment", he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on his continued tenure.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the principle of the plenary assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid an internal upheaval for the tenth time in the ranks of the ERC, which is without direction after losing 11 MPs and half the votes.
The party leader is aware that his threat to resign is not enough for the people close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as weakened as their mentor himself and will not give him the same headaches as other former currents.
The leader of Esquerra is therefore trying to win over the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For starters, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could speak in secret about his continued tenure.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division as well as submission to his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would not feel confirmed with half the votes plus one, and he added without giving percentages that a result "Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Carod's associates are demanding more from the president than just giving his office to the party, an inadequate gesture given Puigcercós' control of the highest organ of Congress.
But since they don't have a majority to force resignations, they'll agree a plan of action with the board between now and May.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU Member States' national authorities to include the European Union in the list of countries with the highest number of registered EU citizens.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós, in return for which he promises to postpone the congress to the fall of 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.
The ERC party chairman believes that 'polyphony' is harmful to stability and he is striving once and for all to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting Councillor Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's circle.
The second one could be the big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC finally abandon the principle of the plenary assembly as a mode of operation.
He is therefore advocating a reform of the statutes to allow elected delegates to hold the congresses.
Puigcercós' team, which has been fighting for it in the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the eventful 2008 assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the General Assembly at a congress to discuss the reform of the statutes.
The Commission has not yet decided on this date, as the internal unrest of recent years has made it unwise to take this matter up.
Now that critical sectors are not on the lookout, it may be time to take this matter up again and close it for good.
23 killed in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO count, there were four fewer cases in Mexico than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO México.
Among the dead are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the second-to-last month of the year, we have a total of 390 deaths, presumably linked to organized crime.
One of the cases is in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a town in Toluca.
Subject had at least three gunshot wounds, the live round was fired at his head, and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas Road in the Santa Cruz Acatlán neighborhood of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, early in the morning, farm workers found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshot wounds in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
A note was found next to the body, believed to be signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was shot eight times after leaving his home to do his job as a garbage man.
On November 7, two 30-year-old men died from gunshot wounds to the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc neighborhood of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with a gunshot wound to the forehead was found on a lonely road in the settlement of El Naranjo and a cartridge case was found under his body, shot with a firearm of this caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewage system of the Playa Golondrina settlement.
The emergency services searched for the rest of the body parts, but they didn't find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Peña Colorada, with hands tied behind the back and head tied.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men was reported, wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a car parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in Tizapán de Zaragoza.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the town of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a note signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two women were found dead in blankets in the settlement of Zoquiapan, Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan, the body of a man, probably named Mario Ríos, was found wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, according to the message left by his killers.
In the San Francisco Acuautla neighborhood of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with gunshot wounds to the neck.
On the woman's skin, Santa Muerte tattoos were discovered, as well as necklaces with corresponding images.
In the last six months, the body of a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a note signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, with their heads covered with duct tape and a note, were discovered in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the body was a note, presumably signed by a criminal organization, that said, "This is what happens to those who do not join".
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found bound by hand and foot with signs of torture inside a taxi parked behind the San Agustín Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón settlement and bound in black plastic bags with a note next to it, the second had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Juárez settlement.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains its targets for reducing greenhouse gases
The Chinese representative stated at COP16 that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is keeping its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He pointed out that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He said China would not change its objectives but would work with the international community on the issue.
He explained that China's climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
He said progress had been made in all aspects, including the adoption last year of a new energy law which included targets for reducing emissions.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states had worked together with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
The Commission established the profitability of the sampled Union producers by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private sources.
He said a project on climate change at the provincial level, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving ones and another on mitigation and adaptation was under way.
Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government on climate change in that country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly believed.
He pointed out that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States they are 100 tons. China is responsible for nine percent of total pollution.
He also said that the EU was making unprecedented progress in energy efficiency, which had increased by 20 per cent in the last five years and was set to increase again by 2020.
♪ I'm not going to let you go ♪
The PAN national leader declared that the former Panist party chairman had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the law allowed him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former PAN party chairman had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the law allowed him.
In an interview conducted before the appeal, Gabino Cué Monteagudos, as governor of the state, explained that the expulsion of Espinos was a decision made at the local level.
"This is an independent decision by the Sonoran Order Commission".
'Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case, so that a decision can be taken by a competent authority,' he added.
On the other hand, he said, it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidates had never been at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, when his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly select the best chairman that Acción Nacional needed for the next three years, and therefore handed the reins "to the one that the Council would appoint".
"I am completely unconcerned and open, and I would be proud to give the post of party chairman to any of the five".
He predicted that the party's upswing in the last election on July 4 would be reflected in the next election, although "it is not the time to think about 2012".
"Now it's time to assist Governor Gabino Cué in his mission".
He stressed that the three governments that emerged from the Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa alliances would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country, so "there are many hopes and aspirations placed in it and I am sure Gabino will live up to the demands".
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourses during his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet", he reiterated.
He believes that the holder of the federal government can make such expressions as he can in his speech in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on speech and even less censorship.
Obama on Twitter advocates for law to help undocumented students
"If you are in favor of the Dream Act, call your senators and urge the passage of this law", the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - a bill to legalize undocumented students - with a message on his personal Twitter blog.
"If you're for the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passage of this bill", Obama tweeted.
His brief includes a cyberlink to a larger document urging the public to contact their senators immediately as the vote on the bill is imminent.
"With your voice we have been waiting for, the time has come to listen to you", he emphasizes.
The news spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block any vote on any bill unless the Bush-era tax cuts were extended and government funding expanded.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the passage of the Dream Act and other bills, such as ratification of the new START nonproliferation treaty with Russia.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be drawn up for the remaining bills.
"I think we have plenty of time...
"We all agree that the tax issue must be resolved before the end of the year"...
"I think we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would "make a request for a vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which would legalize undocumented students, could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, though it is more likely to be next week.
The version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States before they were sixteen, who have lived in this country for the past five years, and who are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the military.
But the bill's proponents need sixty votes to pass the initiative, so they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans.
The Democrats, who are in the majority in favor of the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
That's why the Dream Act's advocates need to get more Republicans on their side in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most sought-after Republicans are Maine's Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over from Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have stated they will no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out in favor of the bill, John McCain, has not yet made his position known.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Putting Literature in the Wound
The second round of 'The Lust for Language' was a walk where participants were encouraged to tell stories
"I understand the sex in language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle celebrating Spanish-language literature and using the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "is getting us into trouble", the Argentine writer spat sweetly at the audience, which was mainly young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend the roundtable moderated by Marisol Shultz, which included Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz later described as a great story. Luisa is the first-person narrator and protagonist who is searching to find out what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she receives no answer, but clues to guide her story.
She leaves the infectious disease doctors convinced that "patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound".
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the trauma specialist, who took her breath away in the middle of the hallway, but who explained that wound was not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar".
The main character sighs with relief, concluding that she "only learned from the wound that it was really open and did not exist".
Valenzuela, the writer, played with them both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'Praise to the Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back men who had traveled far, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The tale turned around and told of America, the great novel that from the beginning was not lacking in its own chronicler, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all [the writers], mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even the sense of shame was gone".
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best", and that is where reality and lies converge, where one no longer knows which side of the narrative to belong to, where fiction reaches its peak.
He actually calls it the Cervantes tradition.
"From him we inherit what is told".
When Mayra Montero was next on the panel, the writer commented on and praised the variety of interpretations that the FIl's invitation to the 'Finger in the Wound' round table had contributed to.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican women dedicated their contribution to the great wound of social violence that their country - like all Latin America - is suffering as a result of the fight against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs involve a tacit, unintentionally planned commitment", she explained, after pointing out that literature is communication and bonding that builds between the author and the reader as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "that finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, even intellectual habits and mind controls are reduced to dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every affirmation is a little no and behind every denial a little yes".
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means putting our finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuance, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white", he observed, inviting us to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he played three decisive games.
In the final match between Santos Laguna and Monterrey, two different styles are also facing each other, defined by their respective coaches, and their contrasting encounter is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but three decisive games, and so far he has been holding up well, which is why this opportunity is very important for him.
The Argentine has won the second championship, he is one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach at the 2002 Torneo Apertura, when del Morelia had the reins in hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the Clausura 2003, he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario, where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take another setback as the game ended in a 2-2 draw against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the eleventh-yard line he came up 3-1 and had two chances to clinch his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his big rival, so he did not want to be haunted by misfortune again and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he reiterates that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, it's for a club, for my affection, which I give myself to, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important", the pilot commented when asked about the lost finals.
The final game is still very much in his memory, he says he learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from this is that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we are on the line prepared, the players are too, because last time we were already prepared to go out with two elfi meters, and I think that's a lesson until the game is over, there is no reason to celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be decided by an eleven-metre shot does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the eleven-metre shot, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce desire to keep the title in our hands, which left us something for this final, and we hope that this time it will not happen".
It is in Romanso's power to be no longer just the second champion and to taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
The US is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
The visa application process is based on the following principles:
As of January 10, 2011, the visa application procedures at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
The new procedure requires most applicants to present themselves at the visa application services (ASC) before their interview at the consulate.
The ASC staff will record the applicant's biometric data, which will be checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced as it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, processing of the visa application and the transport service for the document.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for a visa with application (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for handlers and investors.
Those who simply wish to extend their visa do not need to have an interview at the consulate, they just need to present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
As the biometric data is collected at the ASC, applicants who need a second interview at the consulate will have less time to stay there than before.
Those applying for visas at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the $26 service fee.
The visa application procedure is based on the following information:
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency is holding a press conference tomorrow to announce a discovery that will have implications for the search for life in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be announced at a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a sensational find for the search for alien life", which sparked speculation among experts in other countries.
The discovery could support the theory that in hostile environments previously thought uninhabitable, human-like creatures could exist, and the hypothesis was raised that they could transform into intelligent creatures - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for all life because of the lake's high arsenic content.
Somehow the microbe is using the arsenic as a survival resource, and given this ability, the chances are that there could be similar life on other planets that don't have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, astrobiologists say, it proves that "there is actually another life form, a second life form that is different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the actual scope of its fund at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will include geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn's largest moon) to see if its chemical composition is similar to Earth's.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The reform of the law on the Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th parliamentary term had just begun and an opposition bloc was already in place, led by the PRD, PT, Convergencia and independent Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the inaugural session of the 60th Parliament, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the law on institutions, as they would be excluded.
This reform, they repeated, would introduce a 'two-party system' because now there would be two people, the same number as parties, controlling Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau, headed by Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political marginal position with these reforms.
He said that in the coming days they would talk to the PAN and PRI representatives to change the scheme, based on their political will and if they did not have it, they would be subjugated by both parties again, which would end the opposition coalition.
"This is where I (the opposition coalition) come in, this is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of the others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there are similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not in the spirit of constitutional reform to have a perpetual two-party system in Congress".
"For starters, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other MEPs to get more", explained the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, referring to PAN and PRI, said that the Congress had now become a 'prey' for two.
"Before, it was just one party, now they split it in two".
Patrón Montalvo asked that the Members be respected and given their place at the negotiating table.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to take a decision on this in the near future.
200,000 pesos more for the supplier.
The city of Mazatlan is paying another check to the controversial owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city.
The amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year is thus 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the city's transparency page, the check, numbered 9258447 and worth 200,144.56 pesos, was issued on November 16 for the purpose of "settling outstanding invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already announced that more money would go to the supplier, which is being watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado for selling at inflated prices.
What was not mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and consequently the number of checks still being issued in Camacho Palazuelos' favor.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debt paid, just like the other suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law when a company is challenged by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on July 25 the review of the checks issued by the city to its suppliers, it became known that previously, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she cashed checks worth over 3 million pesos.
The tourist sites need to be improved urgently
Tourism companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in a bad state and cast a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada's trade association, recalled that on several occasions there were calls to take care of the destination and to turn the poor conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and sidewalks had a negative effect, as tourists would come for a stroll and see the mess, turning their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to have to close down a business one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction this slowly and without a plan".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall had drawn attention to the city's lack of prevention and maintenance efforts.
"The community must take responsibility and prevent this from happening again. How can it do that? Well, by preventative maintenance instead of fixing everything afterwards", he explained.
"We are eager to have a clean city. Not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition".
"There are other places that look unkempt and unfinished", he said, "like the Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán".
"Today, we need more than advertising to attract tourists, we need a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and the tourist attractions constantly on fire", he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents expose what is obvious to all: urgent maintenance is needed".
Raúlera Ll Martínez, undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist sites of Mazatlán, as they are not being used properly and have a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places which, along with the city, should be brought to the forefront.
"Fortunately, Mazatlan has many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned up to make them attractive to tourism and to add them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP calls for results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that the deputies should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business community in Mazatlan is calling for a dignified parliament free of collusion between parties and the government, because Sinaloa is in turmoil and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated, made up of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 PAN deputies, three Partido Nueva Alianza deputies, two PRD deputies, one PT deputies, one Convergencia deputies and one PVEM deputies, making a total of 40 deputies.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right to act free from collusion between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, turning themselves into carnival comrades of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups".
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure they do a credible job and are above all committed to society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who put their trust in them in the last elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said one of the major challenges facing the 40 deputies was to drive and work together for the economic growth of the country, because the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures that will somehow promote job creation".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
"I understand that it is the ministry with the second-lowest resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry".
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of cases of illegal immigration to the EU.
The Holy King Is Seen
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family crave dolls, cars, bicycles, and other toys.
It will be difficult for the parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Trinity Day, for the household consists of no more than twelve persons and no less than one goat.
Yet, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar, and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... I go out in the afternoon with the gourds to sell", said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes in the size of a one-year-old.
"He told me 'I would love to have this monster,' but I said 'let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive", Cayetana sadly recalled.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is a size 12, ten-year-old Isaías is a size 10, and eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes, so a pair of size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can join the 'Holy King is Seeking' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, around ten homes were searched in the administrative region of Estrie in the context of the destruction of a network of cannabis production and sale.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will be charged with various offences.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where drugs were mainly manufactured.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used in the production have been confiscated", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested, two of whom are believed to be the main suspects in the drug ring and are from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the courthouse in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be charged with, among other things, the production of cannabis, possession for sale, conspiracy and service of crime.
These searches were the result of a lengthy investigation that lasted for more than a year.
"The information we have received from the public has enabled us to make these arrests", Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Estria regional investigation unit, the Quebec security police, the Sherbrooke police service and the Memphremagog police department took part in the police operation.
The illegal immigration could be easily traced
The Conservative bill, which the government says will address the problem of ships carrying illegal immigrants, is likely to be scrapped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter".
"I stand with a party that has put shackles on your feet", said Michael Ignatieff, leader of the Liberals, after the weekly caucus meeting before the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows for the detention of anyone arriving from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to a year, violates the proposed Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does", Mr Duceppe said.
Olivia Chow, NDP,'s criticism of immigration has turned away critics who claim her party has not been firm enough on illegal immigration.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against the blind passengers, and that is what we are trying to do by introducing another bill, Bill C-35", Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year", Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling the House that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, this criminal activity that affects Canada and treats the country like a pawn".
"They expect Canada to take tough action", Minister Kenney responded.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence on its draft law, which could have led to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a Conservative told QMI that the government would call a vote to have any opposition MPs immediately speak to their constituents.
The new unity cannot be reached by unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a new permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry into the matter.
Robert Dutil, the minister of public security, claims that this idea is not new: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on the subject last January.
The metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Still, Wednesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was not without reason that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, described the announcement as a "magical rabbit out of the hat" and a "solution made at the end of a table" in terms of public safety.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which have not yet adopted the new rules.
"You will see the result when we announce it", he said.
"You know this problem".
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, there is no substitute for conducting a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and me will think he has something to hide", he explained.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign", said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (National Institute for the Training of Senior Administrative Officials).
To break this deadlock, he proposes that Quebec give the audit authority a special mandate to investigate corruption and collusion.
'One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit authority,' he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the audit authority the same powers as the commissioners, which would also allow it to compel people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the cabinets of the Charest government.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to the use of dangerous substances.
This request was made by the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Safety, confirmed that his colleague in the Department of Justice, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain amendments to this dossier.
During the Spring 2001 operation, involving groups of motorcycle police, 131 people were arrested, although the penal code had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several streams remain under strict surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has been falling in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, Mauricie, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudière.
A road collapsed in the process.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 milliliters fell in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimetres of rainfall were expected to fall by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were the most affected.
In total, up to 100 millimeters of rain fell.
In addition to the rainfall, snow melt has already accumulated in certain areas, and several watercourses are likely to be overflowed.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued flood warnings for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudière region.
The northern rivers of Saint-Jérôme, the Laurentians and the Chêne in Lotbinière are being monitored and will continue to be monitored.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused the crossing of several lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an alternate bridge was torn down due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the commune of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said Security Adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec Flood Control Centre issued warnings on Wednesday of a sharp rise in several rivers, particularly the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback in the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial comments about welfare and Haitians as well as his unorthodox radio speech.
The CCNR believes that while Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team are entitled to their own opinion, certain statements "contained inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustified negative portrayals of Haitians, as well as such rude language that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts".
The Board of Supervisors had also concluded that a discussion about suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violated the Broadcasting Code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first order was made following a complaint from the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators should provide solid rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had expressed the view that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
'The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the episodes in question of the programme "Dupont le midi" would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner.'
Hence, he was not held accountable for any wrongdoing.
The last point of contention concerned the statements made in connection with the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media-driven debate on this subject that had generated a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had said that he had not donated to Haiti because he did not know for sure whether the people in need would actually receive the money.
The Board of Supervisors considers that these comments were not of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect presented an unjustified negative image of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this case".
"My record has been virgin for a year and a half", the presenter explained.
In all its decisions, the Supervisory Board condemns the spread of rude language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster had acted 'beyond its obligations'.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was to announce its decisions only once during prime time, within a three-day period, were minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a Montreal native of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excelled in "sanda" (full-contact kung fu), kickboxing, and Thai boxing, now climbs the tatami and into the world's boxing rings in search of new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", said Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally look for fighting everywhere, since for those who do not like the ground fighting as presented by mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare".
Recently, the UPS security guard of his trade gave his rival bad news when he won two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, from October 23-30.
"I won the full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China".
"The fighters in each category who placed in the top four at the last World Championships were invited".
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009".
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam".
"In 2007, I finished fifth in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto", he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition".
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San Shou or Sanda are Chinese martial arts that allow punching and kicking as well as throwing.
The matches are usually held on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most famous boxer to have emerged from this form of martial arts is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, who is well known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal were to withhold just one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China", explained the sympathetic pound-smoker.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)".
"That was a super experience".
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The man who beat me was a real pro", he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)".
"The semi-final winners will face each other in the final of their respective categories".
"Then the winners of each category will face off to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu".
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in contracts to project planners for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor has been awarded the most important share, that of the project management, for a total of USD 295 million without a tender.
This consortium, called 'Énergie gérance', was created in 2004 as a follow-up to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over to the private sector its responsibility for this important hydroelectric project worth USD 5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the energy management consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of distortion of competition and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing the game and it's disempowering the competition".
"This means that instead of games being played in secret, they are now being played in an open way", PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at the press conference yesterday.
Simard had raised the question in the National Assembly early in the morning because he found it difficult to understand how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, had responded to this in the afternoon by vehemently denying that the contract was a setup.
"I will remain true to my line", she said, adding that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "lacked toughness".
She said it was "the least" the PQ could do to apologize.
The consortium model is a worldwide practice.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is a highly complex project in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is under way and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without competition; negotiations had already taken place.
The consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir newspaper reported last week, the consortium's model of civil engineering and consultancy is the subject of government investigations.
A quick glance at the Quebec business register reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
As regards the consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that 'the Baie James territory is subject to a particular labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been taking this into account in a special way since the 1970s'.
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement which has made it clear that the project management contract was agreed.
"If you bid and there are few applicants, your prices will skyrocket".
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this market and you say to yourself: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price".
"The idea is that the price is not the decisive factor, but the expertise of the people", Laporte reiterated.
This contract awarded to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir newspaper listed more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts awarded to companies or their subsidiaries, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had won 22 contracts, Génivar 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including their participation in Énergie gérance.
All these contracts have been negotiated.
The total amount is $449,783,344, including the contract with Énergie gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had made it known that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had made it clear that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that 'financed' it, before clarifying that it was rather their managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The 'green' label is not trustworthy
Green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither in the brands or the eco-labels that should guide his choice.
It is a pity, although it is bathed in a media-driven universe where it is just full of information in favour of more responsible consumption: the responsible consumer barometer has a lack of credible information, a deficiency which is manifest as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading yesterday showed.
Although they have boosted consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to be giving little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebecers admit to believing as little in the environmental commitment of companies as in green corporate advertising, according to a measuring instrument developed by the Centre de Consommation Responsable at the Université de Sherbrooke.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the Barometer.
The same pattern applies to the discourse of politicians on this subject, which is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
The information on responsible consumption nevertheless seems important for stimulating this segment of consumption, which is currently practiced by only about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the lack of information and the questionable nature of the information dampened the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second barrier identified by the barometer, after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebeckers are suspicious of the perceived effectiveness of the green products and services that are being offered.
According to another report, in 2010 more than half of consumers had already changed their habits, mainly by changing the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the Barometer, 61% also preferred to shop at local retailers and preferred to buy local food.
Green and responsible - the Eco-consumption index this year reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its footprint in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness seems to be slowing down, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebeckers said they used public transport or preferred the ride-hailing service to demonstrate their environmental interest in 2010.
Walking and cycling were also favored by 39.1% of respondents in this comprehensive survey of behaviour that feeds into the clichés.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to contribute financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The development company Angus and the company Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, owned by Daniel Langlois, in order to return it to its original cinematic function, did not seem to receive what they had requested.
The government has agreed to get involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a lower-than-initially hoped-for loan, which could create a viable solution on favourable terms, at least according to sources in the government's rumour mill.
The Commission's proposal to set up a European network of national authorities for the protection of the environment and the environment was adopted by the Council on 15 June.
A proposal and an action plan have already been sent by François Macerola, President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), to Minister St-Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris case.
Several days ago he had sent her a final report.
The Council of Ministers has decided to approve the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Commission has now until 31 December to reply to this request.
In any case, the premise of the state grant seems to have been really pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec association of cinema owners and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support to provide for real estate projects there that he had not provided to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment claimed substantial economic aid.
The director of the cinema, Daniel Langlois, had been presenting the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years after the self-financed construction of the cinema, under great difficulties, which could justify the exceptional situation on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of independent movie theaters is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clientele on their toes.
Societe Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are also leading a privately funded campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of Xavier Beauvois's highly successful film 'Des hommes et des dieux'.
But Christian Yaccarini did not withdraw the newspaper Le Devoir and what he and his group think of the proposals made to them, corrected below, is ignored.
The Mystery of Complex-shaken Canada Revealed
The new American diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks reveal the secret of what the United Nations sees as the underlying inferiority complex of Canadians over Americans, but they also reveal the latter's superiority over Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter did not have the Canadian-American relations in mind during the election campaign, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the Conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American embassies in Ottawa and Washington, D.C., that were made public yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantive content to be nibbled on.
A link from 22 September 2008, when the federal election campaign was in full swing, tells us when the UN stopped participating in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers several possible explanations for this situation.
"A near-inherent inferiority complex in Canadians may be causing Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than blame the United States for this election (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)", he says.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of".
The Ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically", he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and even more so a party leader to maintain such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor when going to the polls".
The other expression of this sense of importance is found in the message sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Her trip will help ensure the government's survival in the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, created by a $30 billion to $40 billion stimulus program", Breese said.
He had not mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed stimulus programme.
Another statement from Ambassador Wilkins, dated January 2008, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that dramatic series on CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about programs like Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which have little subtle reference to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or even abductions for the purpose of interrogations conducted by muscle-crazed CIA.
Another report details how Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to take in certain Guantanamo detainees.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question in the affirmative, but on the basis of an individual 'case-by-case' decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "he handed the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file".
Finally, let us note that the mood is heating up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close advisor to Stephen Harper, had said on CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
A Worldwide Plan to Renew Lighting
The UN yesterday proposed in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of homes, commerce and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to almost one third of the additional reductions needed to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the series of major concrete projects the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by the developed countries.
The main problem, the 1.8 billion tonnes of CFCs emitted by lighting, would be avoided if the white light bulbs, which still have a 50-70% monopoly on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or, better still, LEDs.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global vehicle fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters of emissions, including the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 to 49 gt.
However, 5 Gt would still have to be deducted from this balance to stabilise the rise in climate by 2 degrees Celsius between now and 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-glowing bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces light.
The compact fluorescent bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, and the new LED bulbs reduce this energy consumption by a further twofold.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched this week by Philips, a company that participated in the UN study, have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white light bulb, which is a sign of the savings potential of the replacement plan, which is to be implemented in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new bulbs emit very little heat, they can also operate with a regulating resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have pointed out that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless the manufacturers provide a receiving point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-lit bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the benefits that each country would derive from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire immediately after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay", a spokesman for the UN chief stressed.
'It calls on all parties and institutions in Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.'
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the election commission had delayed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight to three days after the election on Sunday without publishing the results.
Some 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue its work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls from around the world were heard for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the Constitutional Council to cancel "fraudulent" votes in the north, which were won by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign in Ivory Coast, confirmed that the FN's tactics of intimidating voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from voting.
The whole election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council takes Gbagbo's complaints into account.
However, Gbagbo's opponents now believe that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a political close associate of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any links to the former rebels, called the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them even if he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he lost, and that it is illegal to appeal to the Constitutional Court after the Election Commission was prevented from publishing the results.
The second round of Sunday's presidential election was held to crown the process of unification and reconciliation in a country that had been divided for years.
The United Nations warned Ivorian politicians on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of the election on 31 October with 38% of the vote to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% (including overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the International Labour Office (IAA), according to the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% when the overseas departments were included.
The unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points over the year.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million workers in the French capital were unemployed but looking for work, whether they were able to work every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market continued to deteriorate, with the unemployment rate rising by 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points in three months, +0.5 percentage points in the year) and 25% when the overseas regions are included.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, on the other hand, recorded a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 over 50, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 age group benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter: 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France overall.
The Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published monthly unemployment figures since 2006, following a dispute over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, however, continues this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
An investigation was opened against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste management company and brother of the president of the general council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, and he was taken to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into the public and suspected fraudulent markets.
Alexandre Guérini is charged with embezzlement of public property, embezzlement of public property, theft, complicity in corruption, illegal bribery and weapons possession, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to answer any questions the prosecution will ask him, instead of spreading fancies".
"It is easy to impose a series of criminal charges on him, but it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man in the department from the PS (Socialist Party), had made it a point to send the judge, before his hearing, a memorandum of defence by his lawyers.
A family member of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but keep his landfill running, which he was supposed to run.
He would never have known about the business area or destination of the associated funds, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the public service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but was released on condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts of the charges against him".
"The chief prosecutor has taken care not to deprive him of his freedom", said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released from custody overnight, including two under judicial supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) waste disposal company, is being prosecuted for "illegal influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants from the Aubagne district, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the charge of "abduction and embezzlement of public property by a public servant" and the other on the charge of "accompanying embezzlement of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "theft and embezzlement of public funds".
Among the persons confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar case of public fraud in Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company of helping to launder money from "high" crime circles.
The investigation of X for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the waste management sector, is being carried out in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigative procedures.
According to sources close to the investigation, the investigation focused in particular on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area and certain towns in the Marseille Metropolitan Watershed (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysee Palace exaggerates its role as a mediator for Syria
In just over six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran on charges of "espionage", shocked the French public, put diplomacy on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eyes of the United States diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper Le Monde reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice to deal with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and wanted by American justice for trafficking in material for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they highlight the way in which the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media to make them believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing about it.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way hostages are treated".
François Richier, the Elysée's strategic adviser, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, the Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and the Middle East, and spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything possible to return their own citizens who were being forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise", they said, "articulate loud and clear and without interruption" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive about its image.
"Do this all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it".
Because "silence solves nothing", past the attempts to discuss in a subtle way, the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "Hostage taking for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (scheduled for August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "demands the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (€230,000 bail).
He also said the Elysee was anticipating more hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he said.
The Commission shall be assisted by the European Parliament.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago but remains in Iran.
Information has been circulated that the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to Iran is being sought by the United States for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from custody by a judge in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to procure material for its nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France buy into a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French ?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision" but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the court decision", he explains.
Mr Richier also points out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" surveillance by French intelligence.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up again, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During Clotilde Reiss's detention in Iran, the Elysee did not spare his efforts to make it appear, through statements and media-organised 'escape attempts', that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an 'important' and 'influential mediating role'.
The Americans are not without irony in their observation of this activity and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 calls for "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis for so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their laudatory statements, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did".
The document then examines the reasons that led the Elysée to fall from this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008 which was then "perceived by many critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"In building up the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria the rewards of playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seed discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows this from a reliable source.
On 11 August, François Richier confided in her: "of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything".
"But we thanked them anyway".
"This should at least confuse the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy will receive them at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriots".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "The Ashtray" that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
A bill to require online game operators to ban access to games for young people under 16 after midnight will be submitted to parliament in December, representatives of the ministries of culture and family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty learning in school and also having a normal life during the day".
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", said Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the draft law for Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturers would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games for those youngsters whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also make available free software to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events involving heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion in global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, beating 58 other nations.
FIFA announces the host country for the 2018-2022 World Cup
In a flash of excitement over corruption allegations, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday will name the countries hosting the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which the struggle for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA's royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its presence in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who will be part of the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) will give an indication of the extent of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes are threatening to stop at the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important to the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the forefront of the revelations by suspending two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have just as easily ruined the chances of their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC had again fuelled this on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that targeted three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to do so.
The head of government hopes for a re-issue of the chess move that his predecessor Tony Blair won in 2005 to host the 2012 London Olympics.
Would this intense effort be enough to restore England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trophies with its already completed stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the British and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which has become a major outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unambiguous reference to the British press' accusations of "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by committee members.
"They're being smeared with dirt, they're trying to compromise", Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favourite.
The world's leading economic power, home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately put together a very nice project.
However, these new bids seem premature for two countries that had co-hosted the 2002 competition.
Another threat: the FIFA's eagerly awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will make the Asian chances for 2022 go to waste.
With Australia and Qatar having been the biggest players in the development of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is expanding into new territories, but these two countries pose a greater risk because of certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time-shift) which European countries have acquired, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
The second mandate: transparency
De Gaulle had really made a dent.
Mitterrand had made it look like he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than that.
One mandate at the Elysee brings the next.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not in keeping with the mystery that is inherent in the presidency.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters claimed that a third term was not out of the question, without even believing in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would announce the prospect of "two mandates" to UMP parliamentarians at the Elysée on Tuesday evening had therefore spread a bit of feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy ?
I was a long way off.
The President merely reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone at such meetings.
"You have seven and a half years left with me, at best, at worst", he told them in July 2009.
On a news story in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the aftermath".
His words from the day before yesterday do not make him more of a candidate than the day before; but neither less.
If they do, it will be for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the presidency with the PS on one side.
It is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal that makes Nicolas Sarkozy reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that is prompting many PS members to fight earlier than expected.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidate like François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to a BVA-L'Express poll).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about it", the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he thought defeat was possible, he would not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, who has accepted the openness.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB's central bankers last year should provide an opportunity to outline ways of getting out of the crisis or at least to announce the introduction of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures, which are due to be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis is making it necessary for the central bank in Frankfurt to avoid the present tense situation on the European bond markets, which is likely to worsen.
The political cost of this would be far too high.
The French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role played by the ECB in helping to resolve Europe's public debt.
It has not dared to say whether it thinks the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its programme of government bond purchases.
'I reserve my comments for my European trading partners (...) '.
The President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, had not been very vocal about his plans at his hearing in Brussels the day before by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, but had merely indicated that the programme of purchases of government bonds on the secondary market would be 'continued' and that we would 'see what the decisions are' at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled its Treasury bond purchases last week to about 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions by some traders, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government bonds yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
The expectation among traders that the price will continue to rise is not in any way in doubt (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a notable change in the exchange rate.
If the borrowing operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB will still make use of its unlimited cash reserves in a generous manner over a period of one week to three months.
The economic experts are already starting to think that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine the ECB changing its programme in any substantial way".
"Otherwise, it would risk provoking new tensions in the short term", says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"I think a gradual exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 is more likely", said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm going to Oppenheim.
In the area of its intervention in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain a bond buying volume that will stimulate the sluggish market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposure of European banks to the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs play into the hands of the underinvested in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weaker countries", a major bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, it will be even harder for governments to reduce or even stabilize their debt.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking refuge in Italy
After a start to the week which was worrying for Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday with the fall in the key interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional chairmen, Giulio Tremonti, had described the situation as "unfathomable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, the German interest rate had reached a record 210 basis points, and the price of the contracts covering the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain amount of confusion in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed "grave concern" about "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In other words, its problem is the lack of economic growth and the resulting taxation slump that puts the state at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget currently before the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission estimates that the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to 3.9% forecast by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken", says the accountant Olli Rehn.
At the moment Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, we have been saying this for a long time", says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian International Monetary Fund trustee in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There are no short-term or long-term problems at the moment, as Italy, despite its high debt ratio (119,2% of GDP in 2011), is required to make less progress in stabilising than other countries", observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, which could lead to early elections by the end of March.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis measures
The European Parliament has also been asked to make a number of proposals to improve the quality of the information it receives.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to do so.
The Commission has not yet decided on the procedure for the adoption of the directive.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, arguably the most effective target for speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political awareness, which is particularly hard on the banking systems", say the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The European countries, well aware of this gap and the danger it presents, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 counterparts are progressing well.
I would like to say that I am very pleased with the Commission's proposal.
The ECB is meeting today.
The unconventional measures to strengthen the backbone of the euro area countries at the crossroads of markets are on the agenda (see below).
As for the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling began his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East on developments in the European crisis.
If the purpose of his visit is not specifically fundraising, he certainly sets the stage for it.
The first advertising expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund, which was mobilized by the IMF's additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the leading countries, are also moving towards structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
The reforms, which are in addition to the austerity measures, are expected to have an effect in the near future.
The Commission is not prepared to accept the amendments proposed by the rapporteur.
Both sides must at all costs avoid having to seek international assistance before they have drawn up their own budgetary adjustments and decided on the necessary structural reforms which will restore their confidence in the long term.
European investors are discussing options to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was in Paris on 24 November, was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get its hands in the sand again.
The economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would suffice, 'preferably' in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This means that the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion, is in place.
The Commission has a number of important tasks to perform.
Especially when market conditions get tough.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in alert level Orange
The snow episodes continue to cause traffic difficulties, particularly on Brittany's secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alert level due to the threat of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alert level, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is affecting the north of Gironde and the Charentes, and light snow is falling in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover is expected to be 2 to 5 cm in the departments concerned, and 7 to 10 cm in some places, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic congestion and disrupt certain economic activities, forecasts Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic over 7,5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac roads.
The traffic situation on the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using your own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's energy supply is not affected by the crisis.
The prefecture "requests drivers to exercise extreme caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% from Orly on Thursday due to heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in south London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
The first financial sketches for the Grand Paris Metro
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport system in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been pouring down.
At least in the discussions.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
In order to prepare the way for the start of construction of the SGP, the State has announced a capital grant of EUR 4 billion.
In theoretical terms, this is the amount that the SGP would then allow to lend a part of the financial sum on the markets at twice its value.
Today, we finally got our first bills.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures planned to raise the first part of these funds.
The Commission has decided to initiate a procedure for the adoption of a new Regulation on the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of employment.
The first, according to Article 15 of the draft law, is 'in favour of the publicly owned company Société du Grand Paris'.
The tax is numbered: 'The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year'.
Secondly, a reorganisation of the existing corporate tax system: "to modernise it, to increase the resulting product and to entrust this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
You're a long way from the four billion.
'It is stated that the tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of capital injection raised by the State and gradually provided to Société du Grand Paris for the project', the explanatory statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"From the moment revenue is recorded (the two taxes, the tax), you can cover the project for three years and then only use the 4 billion", it explains.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that the entry of the 4 billion for the 2014 budget will start in 2013.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Vengeful Hackers and Hardworking Spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal which is merely a scandal in the sinful hypocrisy which governs the relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level and gives a foretaste of a future dominated by recession.
But let's take it one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence service (any nation) is composed entirely of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what you read for months in any journal (except the ones owned by Berlusconi), and the gruesome caricature of Gaddafi's profile has long provided cabaret artists with material for their sketches.
The rule that secret files must only consist of news already known is essential to the dynamics of intelligence services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a library devoted to esoteric publications, you will find that each work (on the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not merely because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the nonexistent), but because those who practice the occult believe only in what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
So is the secret market.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, an editor at Libération), who only accepts as true what he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the one Newsweek had published the week before.
So why has there been such a stir over the revelations of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, that embassies - at least since the end of World War II, and since then even heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representative tasks, have become spy centers.
Any viewer of detective films knows this very well, and it is not hypocrisy that makes you pretend to ignore it.
However, the fact that it is being repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and serves to cast a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that an X-rated hacker could tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal also causes distress not to the victims but to the "executioners".
But let's get to the deep nature of what happened.
Back in the day, in Orwell's time, you could pool all power like a Big Brother, controlling every move of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been completely true since then, where you could control every move you make with your phone, every transaction you make, the hotel you visit, the highway you choose, and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But when you consider what's happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control loop ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker -- chosen as the citizen's avenger -- can unlock the secrets of power.
But how can a power survive if it can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secrets, because it reveals the public sphere; but WikiLeaks-style revealing that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means depriving them of all power.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this insult to such a powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer put any confidential information online - that would be like a street poster.
But it is equally obvious that with current technology, it is futile to hope to keep confidential reports over the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has been on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future, and only for certain ears?
I know that my prediction sounds like science fiction and romance right now, but I find myself forced to imagine the government agents, secretly busy moving in uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages nowhere but in their mere memory, and beyond that, hiding the few written pieces of information they've been given in their shoe socks.
The information would be stored in a single copy in a sealed box: basically, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is advancing like a cancer these days, which is backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph with (telephone) wires.
The (analogue) videocassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a film tape by tape, by rewinding it from back to front and revealing all the secrets of editing, while the (digital) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, in macro proportions.
High-speed trains take three hours to travel from Rome to Milan, while air travel, including the changeover, takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communications technology to return to the car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is making good on its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to review the implementation of fast-start pledges (also known as 'fast start' or early financing) by developing countries.
And the French beauty parlours are exposed.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, developing countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million a year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has been pulling up all the stocks to convince its partners of its commitment to fast start funding: detailed progress reports from its Member States, press conferences, major side events, distribution of brochures.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its very value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same thing at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has committed €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be 'new and additional' according to the Copenhagen Treaty to ensure that additional investment is made without detriment to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline he or she considers best.
The EU Commission, for example, has chosen to set the benchmark for 2009: international financing will be maintained and 150 million will be added over three years under the 'Start-up' financing.
Other countries have adopted similar guidelines, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France considered that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 was 'new and additional'.
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the previous year's expenditure or for global public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France claims to be in compliance with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into grants and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses his own calculation mode.
Some, such as France, consider 1 € borrowed to be equivalent to 1 € donated.
Obviously, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often emissions-controlled projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro as the equivalent of a donated euro.
But France has no other reasoning than to "respect" its €420 million commitment by borrowing 91.5% (€389.8 million) and donating 8.5% (€36.1 million) - see also the EU document to see for yourself.
France is the only EU country that makes large use of loans.
Germany claims 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) are fulfilling their obligations 100% through donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and means a comparable investment.
That's a good hocus-pocus.
In the first place, the Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council for the establishment of a European Investment Bank.
France succeeds in making it appear that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it seems that Bercy was the one who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; firstly, internally (why do the other member states continue to donate when they can only borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries cannot be completely fooled...
The chapter on early finance is only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the whole of the climate debate.
But it could be the drop too much in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is imperative that he learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward the debate on the subject of longterm financing (another crucial and currently debated topic): the question of the 'accountability' or the way its loans are accounted for cannot be escaped.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The hope is therefore in the new environment minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's Fast Start and its vision of 'accountability' and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (formerly the movement for the protection of the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which states that its results 'in view of the small number of samples analysed do not represent a statistically significant value but are rather illustrative of the problem being dealt with', bought between July and September the food normally consumed in four meals, by a child of about ten years of age, plus a snack, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products, and a pint of water a day - have been tested by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants, as have sweets.
The balance sheet is staggering: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 endocrine disruptors, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded in the vast majority of cases, this survey shows very well that the reality of the consumer's exposure to potentially carcinogenic substances or endocrine disrupting substances is a cause for concern", the association notes.
Already at breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three of those that are certainly carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including at lunchtime, in which the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
Also, the chopped steak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the gum were spiked with pesticides and other chemicals.
The analysis of the tap water revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 identified chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not uncontaminated.
The ultimate risk of this "pollutant cocktail" to the consumer "is likely to be underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, 'in view of the urgency of the situation', a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt the 'increase in diseases of civilization'.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
