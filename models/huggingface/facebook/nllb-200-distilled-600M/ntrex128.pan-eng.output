Welsh AMs are concerned about 'looking like clowns'
Some AMs are reluctant to suggest that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It arose as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs of the political spectrum are concerned that this may invite humor
A Labour AM said their group is concerned, it is sung with Twp and Pwp
For readers outside Wales: Twp means daft in Welsh and pwp means poo.
A playdate AM said the whole group was unhappy and suggested changes.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "Open Minded" about the name change, but noted that he was a short-lived spoken hop for Muppet from MWP.
In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced the same as the English U in Yorkshire
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "It becomes necessary that a final decision on which workers are called by the members of the Assembly is made on the matter of their members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal which received widespread support for the Assembly to convene a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the AMs title, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
The AMs are clearly suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to gain consensus may be difficult for the presiding officer, Ellen Jones, who hopes to submit a draft law on the change within weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on the design of AM disabilities and committee management.
When they debate the law they will get the final vote on the question of what they should be told.
Macedonians go to the referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
A public vote was established to resolve a decade-long dispute in Greece, whose own province is called Macedonian.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to one of its territories and has repeatedly objected to its membership bills for the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgy Ivanov has told the opposition to the referendum on the basis of a name change that they will ignore the vote
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Joran Zaev, argue that the name change is worth the price to pay for joining the European and NATO
Bells of St. Martin Fall Sileth in Churches in Harlem Sturgeon
"Historically, I have spoken to the ancient people to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner", said Mr Adams.
There is no one here today.
He said the twelve came to be lost
He said, "People nowadays socialize in a different way.
The bars are no longer living rooms in the neighborhood where people regularly visit.
For churches he worries that there will be no money left from selling the property unless leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
He said churches could be replaced with apartment buildings, where they are filled with people who did not help the rest of the neighbouring shelters.
Many people who buy condominiums in these buildings will become white, and so soon the day will come when these cathedrals will be completely closed, as it is unlikely that most of the people who visit these condominiums will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by the Gores before becoming St Martin's, a black metropolitan metropolitan community of Harlem, in 1870.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's
A group of black people who worshipped nearby had taken the title of building
St. Martin's was occupied by a group of blacks under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major street for shopping in Harlem who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's pastor hired Carlin to plan to rebuild it.
Johnson's son and St. Martin's successor, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called Carlin "the bells of the poor"
The expert who played Carillon in July called it something else: A cultural treasure and "a stable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that the world's first carillon was performed by a black musician, Denisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merivadhar said that St. Martin did not replace him
What has been played out at St. Martin's in the last few months remains a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders, and another brought by Episcopal sub-states.
The Westery - the governing body of Paris - sub-state, made up of Leeds leaders, expressed concern that the sub-state was willing to pass the Westery with costs, even though Westery was not involved in recruiting buildings and contractors sent to the sub-state.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on behalf of the province
13-year-old injured by shark attack on Lobster Dives in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for the lobster on the first day of lobster season in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWT in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then paddled him with a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first said that he thought it was a great thrill to catch a lobris, but then he "felt like he was screaming, 'I've learned a little!
I learned a little!
All her rest was opened after she cut off", Hamal said when she saw the boy once.
I had warned everyone to get out of the water: Hamel said.
The boy was taken to Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed for critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack were unknown
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles, giving a brief speech to a media outlet, said a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was determined not to be a threatened species of the shark.
Giles inserted the wound into the victim's upper abdominal area
Officials have stopped traveling to the beautiful beach from Casaballad to Ponto Beach in Swami's Ekstad for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that the area has more than 135 species of sharks, but most are not considered threatened
Sansbury's plans entered the UK beauty market.
Snesbury is taking department store-style beauty stalls with boots, superdogs and dabinhams that are working with specialty accessories.
As part of a significant £2.8 billion capital market in the UK beauty market, which is steadily growing as fashion and homeowner sales return, the big beauty aids will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be brought to other stores next year.
Investing in beauty once the lawsuit is filed for TVs, microwaves and homeware comes as a supermarket hunt for ways to use shelf space.
Sansbury said it will double its beauty to 3,000 products, including Revlon, SC, Tweegerman and Dr. PawPaw (Paaw Pow) for the first time.
Existing categories from Laurel, Mabelline and Burt Bees will have more space with branded areas like those found in shoe stores.
The supermarket is resuming its boutique make-up range to make most products vegan-friendly - sometimes in demand by small shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop is looking for discounts at two stores in Salisbury, which opened last week in Croydon, South London while the second sewing shop is opening in Oak, Birmingham later this year.
A shift towards online shopping and small daily food purchases at local convenience stores means people will have to do more to convince them to visit supermarkets
Salisbury chief executive Mike Cape has said that outlets will look like department stores as the supermarket chain seeks to fight overservice and non-food counterparts against LD and Liddle
Sansbury has installed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also offered several accommodations after buying both stores two years ago which is said to have increased grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The supermarket's previous efforts to improve its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sansbury experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but ended up with a tie-up of how to distribute its drugs to its supermarkets in its registry stores.
The new strategy came after Salisbury sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy chain owner Selecio for £125m three years ago.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, combining an extensive line of luxury leather brands such as La Roshé-Pose and Michi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sunsbury said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty azulus to expand reach for our customers.
We have also invested in highly educated collaborators who will be available to advise.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need and the friendly environment and convenient locations mean that we are now on an amazing beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'lost' after being pulled out of an $11 million deal by Holly Wilfbee
Dragons Day star Peter Jones left 'Gone' to sign TV spokesman Holly Wilizby to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV to his lifestyle brand business for £11 million
WillyB is not really having time for his household goods and trolleys brand.
The business pair was merged with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand
This morning's speaker, 37, announced his departure on Instagram
Holly Willy left the Dragons "Dan Star" Peter Jones in his final days to focus on his new bumper deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV, taking him out of his lifestyle brilliant trade.
Sources say Jones was "outraged" when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a stressful meeting at her business empire headquarters in the town of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant they no longer had enough time to dedicate their home appliances and accessories brand to Truly.
The business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and she was asked to double Willy's estimated £11 million fortune.
As Willyby (37), she announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones has moved out of England for one of her holiday homes.
One source said: Truly, the top of the list of slowest was the top
It was looking at her long-term future, which she would see over the next two decades.
The decision to expel the rest of the people was made to stay stuck
No one was believing what was happening on Tuesday, it was very close to the start.
Marlowe headquarters has a full warehouse that is ready for sale.
Experts believe that this morning's presenters, who are among the UK's most trusted stars, could cost the firm millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and are likely to have further delays in its launch.
And this could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother-of-three Willow and husband Dan Baldwin, Jones and his wife Tara Cap have been living in the area for about ten years
Villagby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman in March.
Holiday couple and Jones hold a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm
Willifb has become a brand ambassador for M&S and will transform Ant McPartlan as ITV's ISA celebrity
A source close to Jones said he would "not comment on his business affairs".
We had difficulty communicating, and then we fell in love
He joked about some media commenting on "unidentification" and criticism of North Korean leaders considering being positive.
Why has President Trump given such priority?
Trump joked in the voice of "News Anchor"
"I left nothing behind".
He noted that while Kim was interested in the second meeting after his inaugural meeting in Singapore in June, Trump took steps towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the disarmament talks were over.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's chief ambassador, Re Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN the General Assembly said on Saturday that the North had "no response from North America to take the initial disarmament step from North Korea".
Instead, he noted, the US has continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump brought another optimistic outlook to his rally speech
"We are doing great with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions have been killed
We now have these enhanced relationships
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and returning American troops to escape.
And he maintains his unusual attitude in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get out of this packed mess, we have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing straight at the crowd.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake devastate an island, killing hundreds
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed
Although 10 percent of the population of Limback had been wiped out, no national disaster was declared, a first requirement to generate international aid.
Ms Sumong said: "In many cases, unfortunately, they have become very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging".
While a team is being formed to travel the pets to save the children, it is not yet known whether foreign workers can work on the ground
National Disaster Agency spokesman Shri Sutopo said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief
The earth is being shaken by the earth which Indonesia is constantly tolerating, the country is suffering greatly from natural outbreaks
While tsunami shelters have been built in Ash, they are not a common sight on other shores
The apparent lack of tsunami warning alarms in Palu, although an alert was in effect, is likely to contribute to loss of life.
In good times, it is challenging to travel to many countries in Indonesia
Natural disasters make laxity even more complicated
A hospital ship is being deployed in Lambac to treat earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days at the new disaster site
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's agile infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he has plundered money on roads and railways
But the lack of funds has disrupted Mr. Joko's administration as he runs for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko has also faced sectarian tension in Indonesia, where Muslim majority people adopt a more conservative form of faith
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought on the streets using motobats, arrows and other raw weapons

Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a woman to death
An investigation into the murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old man was found with a knife wound at 7.55am on Grayson Mouse on Jorn Street, a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people in the areas to come forward who had seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the John Street area at Burnham to contact us.
I would appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have captured anything on Dashcam Photos to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.'
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman came to the scene to ask where she had met this morning
The investigation is ongoing as the police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's relative.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mouse has recently tried to go home although no one is allowed to enter or leave the building, police are reporting.
When he realized what had happened, he was still in shock.
Residents are being told that they will not be allowed to return for a long time.
A police officer was heard saying that the entire area is now seen as a crime zone.
A woman was seen crying at the scene.
She repeatedly says, 'It is terrible.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were standing inside the cordon and another van outside.
Several officers stood inside the cordon to inspect the blocks of flats.

The statue of the Parliament of the Commonwealth became the most recent monument because of the 'rewrite of history'.
This dismissal would be justified in their criticism of the social and religious practices of the ancient ruffian upper Panchayati Scheduled Castes of England such as their Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Sunsamth, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current discussion about the removal of the statues it was inevitable that the image of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
The statue of the English common battles was neither ordered nor completed by Cromwell.
Cromwell sacrificed for the activities of Thomas the Elder in the last century
Sir William Hameau Throncroft's brilliant representation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century view and a history of a painting author's part that many believe is to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsworthy told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is being consulted by many people in the late 19th century, as a protection of Parliament from external pressure, in his monarchical case, than he is today.
Although it is a perfectly accurate representation, it is a subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century struggle shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Crowwell is an individual identifiable figure who represents one side of this divide.
Lord Protector is worthy to celebrate and remember his achievements".
The Slayer Pork Moles Killed the Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The South China Morning Post said on Sunday that the man was identified only by his surname "Yuan", who was found dead from a serious artery injury in a market in Lipansui, Guizhou province, which was bloody.
A pig farmer was vaccinating pigs in a pig barn in Xining, Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly came from the neighboring Yunnan region to sell 15 pigs at the market with his cousin.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, and found a door to open a nearby pig's den.
He said that there was a large male saw in the fence with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a legal investigation confirmed that 550 pounds of pigs caused the death toll on the farmer.
My cousin's legs were stained with blood and bottled, according to Guyang Evening News, his cousin referred to him by his surname "Voo".
Security camera footage showed that Yuan went to the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later
The beast that killed this man was not John's or his brother-in-law's.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was stopped from attacking another person, while police had gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although previously very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the individual.
Ten years ago, a 650 pound pig drove a Welsh farmer in a tractor until his wife drove him away.
In 2012 an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not particularly aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They are just being shy.
They're nice, curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You need to keep them in the right way", he said.
The remainder of the day of the hurricane will bring heavy rainfall in the Southwest of the United States.
As predicted, the hurricane is weakened daily as it is on the cool waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Roza will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern US in the coming days.
The day had winds of 85 mph in Category 1 hurricanes at 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and Punta Eugenia, located 385 meters southwest of Mexico.
On Sunday, the road is expected to move north of Roza
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is taking shape above the ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As the roosa reaches the land of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical cyclones into the northern, northern, southwestern United States.
The rainfall will increase to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the combination of humidity with humidity will lead to heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause dangerous mudflows in the desert, debris flows and potential landslides.
Rainfall, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, due to hot humidity, will reach 2 to 3 inches per hour.
Some parts of the southwest, especially parts of Arizona, are expected to receive 2 to 4 inches of rainfall.
Due to the scattered flow of tropical rain, the situation is likely to deteriorate soon with flooding.
It is very unhelpful advice to walk out into the desert at the risk of heavy rain.
Heavy rainfall can cause rivers to form in the valley and thunderstorms will cause strong winds and dust to blow at the local level.
The Nikitavati Trough will bring some locally heavy rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California
Rainfall of half an inch is possible, which will reduce the flow of rubble and cause slip on the road.
This will be the first rainfall of that summer season.
Some scattered remnants of Ushnandi Musladhara rainfall will arrive in Arizona before Monday on Sunday and before that rainfall will be more extensive on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread in four corners on Tuesday and Wednesday will be the last day.
The US may experience some extreme temperatures in October as the Arctic cools, although summer seasons remain very warm.
Sometimes this indicates extreme temperature changes in a short period of time.
Sunday's focus is an incredible example of extreme temperature variation across the U.S.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, efforts will be made to build and re-expand the summer heat.
Most of Central and Eastern America is likely to see the beginning of summer in early October, which was seen in the northeastern parts of the country, in the 80s.
New York City's temperature could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be ten degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast is showing a high probability of improving over the temperatures forecast by the main part of the Eastern U.S. in October.
The Brent Kavanaugh hearing was watched by over 20 million people
Supreme Court nominee Brent Kavanaugh and the woman who accused Christine Blasey Ford of sexual abuse in the 1980s were watched by more than 20 million people on the Six Television Network on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: Arizona Sen drafted an agreement with the FBI to investigate for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that drug-addicted Kawan.Ho caught him and tried to take off his clothes at a secondary school party.
Kavanaugh said in enthusiastic testimony that he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
It is possible that more than 20.4 million people watched it, reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The institute was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data were not immediately available for other networks including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network.
And Nelson has often had trouble estimating the number of people who look in offices.
To put it in that perspective, the audience count is similar to a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
The Fox News Channel, whose celebrity hosts have strongly sponsored the Kawanhaun arrangement, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.8 million and CNN 2.52 million with viewers, Nielsen said.
Interest remains high after hearing.
Flack was the central figure in Friday's play.
The Central Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, who was being stalked by CNN and CBS cameras by non-communists on Friday morning as he attempted to ride the elevator in a judicial committee hearing.
They stood in the eye with a lot of frustration for a very short time as if they were being beaten up by a live broadcast on CNN.
One woman said, "I am standing here in front of you".
"Do you believe that he is telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power when other women do not".
Flack said his office had issued an announcement and said, before the elevator closes, he will have more to say in committee.
The cable and broadcast networks were all showing the event live after hours, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kwanhao's nomination across the Senate.
But Flax said they would only do so by understanding that the FBI will investigate charges against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats are appealing to.
Flack had participated in a discussion with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Couns.
After consulting with the Councils and several Senators, Flack made his decision.
Flack's election had strength, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the vote to approve the couch without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kwon Ho.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics and Brexit of 'playing politics'
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of being "political game" with the UK's future of leaving the European Union, and accused the Sunday Times of undermining national interests in an interview.
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another meeting with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson pressed the attack on his so-called Checker plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely unclear".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrested Deaton Simpson suspected in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting attack on 20-year-old basketball player, Wade Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department said Dayton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for second-degree murder.
Officials showed a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered glasses from the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA, a CBS member reported to WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had accepted the targeting of Wade.
According to the lawyer's reports, his bond is set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released an initial report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The department is assisting the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police and civilian investigations in the area to make the arrest possible.
LSU Athletic Head Joe Alevane thanked for "seeking justice and justice" for enforcing the area's law.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball advisor Wade said the team has been "saddened" by Wade's death and is "in shock".
"That's what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
A volcanic fire is burning over Mexico City
Lava from the Popocatypal volcano has reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after waves from the volcano's head and recorded 183 gas and ash discharges in 24 hours.
The center was investigating a number of cloud thunder and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash-coated cars windshields like ZochiMilco in the vicinity of Mexico City
Geoscientists have seen an increase in activity in the 45 miles (72 km) southeast with a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that rocked central Mexico in July 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the Independence Voting Anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after riot police clashed with pro-independence protesters, and thousands of people joined the anti-protests to watch the main ceremony of the Catalan Polvary vote.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by terror police threw powder paint on him and others, shading black clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Handcuffs continued later in the day and the police used their batons to participate in the fight.
Referring to "no mistake, no apology" during the hours after independence, federal protesters shouted, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen persons treated minor injuries in assembly cases, the local press reported.
October is considered illegal by the referendum by Madrid but tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters cast large ballots to become independent, although the number of voters with dissident residents was small but a large part of the vote boycott.
About 1000 people were injured last year after Catholic officials tried to block voting at all polling stations in the region due to violent clashes last year.
Pro-liberty groups camped out overnight on Friday to stop a protest in support of the National Police.
The exhibition moved on but was forced to take a different path.
Narcisse Termas (68), an electrician who participated in separatist radical involvement with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we had some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they were able to vote but now we are trapped", she said.
Despite narrow victories in regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain pace this year as many of their well-known leaders struggle to maintain pace pending their trial and even after the next declaration of independence for their role in holding a referendum in self-determined slaughter or detention.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, protested in support of the police on his phone, saying the struggle has been stopped by politicians on both sides.
"It is becoming increasingly stressful", he said.
On Saturday, Olivier Joucruz, who was nine Catalan pioneers from the end of last year, had participated in facilitating pre-initiative reforms until the end of last year. He said he would fight for European parties next year.
"The best way to reject the exception to democratic values and coercion as candidates for the European elections is from the Spanish government", he said.
London: Man arrested for colliding with car at home.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after repairing a vehicle and throwing it into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballinagard Crescent.
Death inspected Bob Blemings said the door and building were damaged.
A car could be shot on the side of a road.
Manga Straight won 1-0 against Livingston Rangers
Livingstone's first goal of the manga secured the win
The promoted Livingstone denied the Rangers the appointment of Steven Gerrard to manage the Iboroughs club, only their second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be a difference as Gary's side moved to second place with the Hebrainians.
Gerard's team remained unsuccessful in the premiership this season and led the losing leader Hart's side with 8 points the following Sunday.
Previously, Rangers hosted the Europa League on Thursday in Rapid Vienna.
Livingstone, meanwhile, continue to move into the division for six recreational runs to boost their run, with chief counsel Holt tasting a defeat after Kenny Miller's return last month.
Livingstone missed the opportunity for blunt tourists.
Holt's team had to move on some time before scoring, the Rangers faced a lot of problems due to their obvious qualities.
Scott Robinson ended his efforts on his goal This time Alan Lithgow could only direct his work, after which he slid to target Craig Hackett's title character.
The hosts had convinced the Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew they could disturb visitors in small sections.
And this was the way the main goal was achieved.
Rangers surrendered a free-kick and Livingstone opened an opening, Decklan Gallagher and Robinson set up the manga, which scored from a touchdown and the box's focal point.
At that stage, the Rangers had taken possession of the property although they had found planetary security difficult and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely stable,
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had defended Kelly.
Sick pitman deprived Rangers goalkeepers Alan McGregor and Lithgow of a leg by preventing a leg from claiming to be blown off the leaveston set play.
Parr consistently came into the Livingstone box and continued to play it consistently, while two penalty claims - after alternating Glenn Middleton, and a helmet test for handball - were taken second.
'Authentic' from Livingstone - Analysis
The BBC Scotland has been featured in Allard Lamont at the Tony MacRone Arena.
Excellent performance and results for Livingstone.
For a man, they were wonderful, advancing the desire for this upper path.
Their style of play and players rarely change as they reach the top, but the credit still needs to be given to that team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was marching the guard with a highly organized manner of rescue, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell on his feet.
The Rangers lacked motivation, however.
As Gimbers they have been subject to Gerard now and again, they have missed the lack of those standards.
Their last loss was a ball - they only hit home runs in one inning - and it's a reminder for the Rangers, who got in the middle of the table.
Erdoğan receives a mix reception in Cologne
There were smilies and blue skies on Saturday (29 September), while Turkish and German leaders Vazoo had breakfasted in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of German President Erdogan - aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's progress to the European Union.
Erdogan then led Cologne to open a large mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000 crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came close to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Andron protesters - many of them Kurds - also heard their voices, denouncing both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome his country.
The two-sided ross expression refers to the distribution of a visitor welcomed by some German Turks as a hero and controlled by others.
Deportford road accident: death of cyclist in car crash
A cyclist dies in London after colliding with a vehicle.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 BST in the south-east of the city, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in DeWittford.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and provided medical assistance but the cyclist died on the spot
Another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Children's Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash
The Metropolitan Police said that the authorities are trying to identify the man and inform his close relatives.

Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in the accident
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at the correctional facility of high security men, the prison official said.
The riot ended at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire, Basel at around 09:30 BST on Sunday.
Specialist "Toronto" officials have gathered to arrange the disorder, which includes eight prisoners and one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service representative said: Specifically trained prison staff has been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the responsible persons will be sent to the police and they can spend a long time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison representative had been treated in hospital after being attacked by the prisoner.
And in October a year ago, the officials of the rally were called to jail to deal with the serious situation in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, with Salt Lake City flash flooding (drought areas may benefit)
A collision with Arizona is rare of a tropical depression, but the remainder of Hurricane Roza's energy trail is likely to occur southwest of the desert early next week, potentially threatening flooding.
The National Weather Service has reported flooding potential for western Arizona on Monday and Tuesday, including urban areas in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The day can move towards late rain on Monday and take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote in a tweet that a single "ten tropical storm winds have sustained storm or tornado status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the border of the Azes".
The latest National Hurricane Center models estimate for 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, varying up to 6 inches in Moglon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest including the Central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to reach 1 to 2 inches, making it possible to lower 4 inches.
Outside the fire hazard, the day could be a gift from rainfall as these districts were dry
Although flooding is a matter of deep concern, a portion of this rainfall will likely be valuable as dry weather conditions are currently coming to the southwest.
Less than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest-level classification, weather.com reports, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
First, the path of the hurricane's roaring goes to landfill across the California Peninsula rather than Mexico.
Rosa, still at sea storm quality on Sunday morning, with the fastest winds of 85 mph, is moving north at 12 mph at a distance of 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The storm is experiencing cold water in the Pacific Ocean and is thus slowly cooling.
It expects to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of Hurricane Ushenkandi
Heavy rainfall may occur in some parts of Mexico, indicating a risk of severe flooding.
"Weather.com reported that" 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from northwest Sonora to Baja California, with up to 10 inches of rain expected".
Roza will traverse northward into Mexico as a tropical storm, passing through Arizona and southern Utah by Tuesday night, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical storm.
The anticipated primary risk from the fast or heavy rainfall from the storm is to Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
It depends on rainfall to cause dangerous flooding, debris flows in the desert and rock slides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attacks: Four killers arrested
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following the attempted murder of a 16-year-old in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found in an injured condition around 04:00 BST on Saturday in the region of Midsomer Norton, Accelerator Terrace.
He was taken to hospital where his condition was stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight from the Roadstock area, Avon & Samseast Police said.
Officials have appealed to all who may have footage on mobile phones to come forward
Trump says Kwanhaw faced the Democratic Party's 'guilt, anger, anger.'
"The vote for Judge Kwanhoe is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and oppressive strategies", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kwanhof faced "democratic party sensationalism, anger" during his nomination process.
Kwanhof testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying an accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that she was dating to several decades ago when she was young.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his accusation
The president said Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage and courage that day.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the most capable legal confirmation of our time, the best public service lawmaker", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly signaled the nomination of Kwan How, speaking about the importance of the Republican Party's vote in the midterm elections.
"We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
They said, "I am not fighting, but I am fighting really.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere"
Trump argued that the goal of the Democrats is to oppose and create disruption.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is likely to be held after Friday, a senior GOP leadership ally has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and death rate rise
Officials said on Saturday that Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, killing at least 384 people, with very large sea waves washing up the beaches.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a feast on the beach in the city of Palu, when six metres (18 ft) high waves blew in the east of the evening and resulted in many deaths and everything in their path was destroyed.
After the tsunami, there was a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately leave and they were affected", said a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, BNPB, in a statement in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come on its own, it pulled cars, logs, houses, threw everything on the ground. Nagaroh said the tsunami had come at a speed of 800 km (497 mph) on the open sea before reaching the coast.
They said, "Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were sent to 24 centres in the city of Pau.
Aerial images released by the accident agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed, and a mosque was surrounded by water.
The storm continued in the coastal city on Saturday after the tremors.
Seismic warfare was felt in areas with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It's been said that the geography of a city that sits at the end of a long, narrow bay could increase the size of a tsunami.
Nugueroho described the damage as widespread and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said 540 people were injured and 29 were missing, some of the victims' bodies were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Naguroh said the deaths and disasters occurred in the region of Donggala, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palou, on the coast, near the epicentre of the earthquake.
"We have not received any information because of the complete disconnect with Dongla", said Nugueroho.
More than 300,000 people are living there", the Red Cross said in a statement, with its employees and volunteers moving to the affected areas.
It said, "It's a tragedy, but it could be worse".
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not broadly reporting the tsunami to the public, although officials said the waves came in time and were already reported.
Amateur footage shared on social media has revealed that a man on the top floor of a building can hear a tsunami warning from the screams of people standing down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water had flooded the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters were unable to verify the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami created a major power, cutting off communication around the Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts
Officials have started sending needed aid to cargo ships from Jakarta and other cities, but victims still need more food and other basic needs
The city airport has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until the end of October.
President Joko Widodo had scheduled to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami toll soar is above 800.
This is really bad.
Although Dongola's World Vision staff have made it a safe city of Pulu, where employees are taking refuge in the shelter of tarpaulins in their office yard, they pass the scene of disaster along the way, said Mr. Dosemba.
And he said, They told me that they saw many houses destroyed.
This is really bad.
Aid groups started their relief equipment with severe disruptions, some people complained that experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from getting adopted.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing can start abroad as soon as the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Alia Ariana, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, well, this is a national disaster, we can get international help but there is no such situation yet.
As in the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday in Palo, friends and family of missing people hope that their loved ones will perform miracles that will feed the stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken down with the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers removed a woman who had been buried with her mother's body under the rubble for two days.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gendon Subandono had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, who were hiding in Indonesia earlier this month.
Among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were some of his students, including Ms. Mandagi.
As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden, he said.
Mr. Gannon told how the news of the para-gliding hotel collapse spread among the people, he sent WhatsApp messages to the beach festival participants.
However, their messages were the result of grey checkmarks rather than blue checks.
He said "I think the messages were not given",
Thieves took $26,750 during an ATM rifle at Newport at Levi's
According to a report released by the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from BRINX workers who were refilling ATMs at Levi's in Newport on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was clearing an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to take more money, says Dennis McCarthy in the paper.
When he had taken over, another man "run over the back of the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money kept for delivery
According to the released report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper changed his name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to - Yeah.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "He is commonly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been dubbed Y for some time and used as a moniker for his eighth album, which was released in June.
This change comes after his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was hoping to launch his new album, Yanti.
The show's creator said he replaced singer Ariana Grande, who "canceled the show for emotional reasons"
In addition to being the acronym for his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am, this is ours.
He moved out of Kanae, which means that only our good, our bad, our confusion, the only reflection of everything is only Yehu.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
He is one of several famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P.D.D. or DD, but this year he has announced his preference for the name of love and brotherly love.
A former Western colleague, Jay-Z, has also created with or without hyphen and capital.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody struggle against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at the Tal Talleteloco Plaza that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
The military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing more than 300 people as left-wing students took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans who are studying and opening other free universities by offering them a monthly subsidy.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double AI funding.
Investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more agile in artificial intelligence, the US should double the research costs in this field.
AI policy has been announced following comments from various parts of the US government, although there is a lack of a formal AI strategy in the US as a whole.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: It aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for further success in AI", Lee said.
Lee said in an interview this week that doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI acquisition will be in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, this month, has invested in Face++, one of the leading AI companies in China.
In 1980 Carnegie worked on an AI system at the University of Milan that beat the highest ranked American Othello player and he was later the administrator of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee accepted past U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next time would be to push the next one.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government support.
Lee said, "It's not China that's driving academic leaders away; it's corporations.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university intellectuals to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. expand its AI efforts.
I think the KPD in AI should be automatically green cards.
The State Council of China released its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Li said; "China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to academics, like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that provide funding to U.S. researchers, but China's academic work is of poor quality".
Earlier this year: The US Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence agency, meaning to involve industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of an artificial intelligence department for the select committee
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the law creating a National Security Commission on the U.S. Legislative Artificial Intelligence Agency has been in the works for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country.
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday for the Republic of North Macedonia, a step towards resolving the decades-old dispute with Greece that had halted its bid for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and confirms its admission to NATO and the European Union.
The two governments had reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gejever Ivanov has said that he has not voted in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the vote will meet at least 50 percent to be valid for the referendum.
Question of the referendum: Do you agree to NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zvezhe, argue that as Yugoslavia is one of the emerging countries from the collapse, Macedonia must pay to join organisations like the EU and NATO.
Oliveira Georgijeva, 79, said at Skopje; 'I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us.
Although not legally binding, many members of parliament have said they will follow the vote results to make a decision
A two-thirds majority in Parliament will be required to change the name
State Election Commission said that as of 1 pm there has been no report of irregularities
However, the turnout was 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
Gjos Tniewski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje said: "I came to vote because of my children.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Deshko cast their referendum to change the name of the country in Macedonia, which will pave the way for accession to NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of the tent set up by the referendum boycotts.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to connect with our heads up, not through the service door", said Kvadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonians, we can turn to other people like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian solidarity".
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe the majority will be in favour because 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO", Zeev said after his vote.
He said "Yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
A survey, published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday, said that 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in a referendum if they were under the required voting age.
Another survey by Macedonia's Telma TV shows that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said yes they would vote that
To be successful in the referendum, one vote must be more than 50 per cent.
The failure of the referendum marks the first serious policy stance of the Western government, which took office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City led the entire Brighton to the goal of safety.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling secured the title with a 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City, England on Saturday.
Aguero made the score ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass on the midfield early in the order.
Before he hit the field, he ran three of the Brighton defenders.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
Before he could hit the bride's box, he pushed a defender.
He then went to the left to find Sterling.
The first Englishmen to use their first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan, who took the shot to the right in the middle of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero is struggling with some of his foot problems".
We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky, he scored a goal in that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early lead in the Premier League.
This was in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside the game in the area of Brington.
He threw a beautiful ball from LeRoy Sen's left.
Before leading Sterling to a distant post, San made some touches.
The Blue Blues managed to lock the ball in the net before moving forward.
On Tuesday, the championship group played at 12:55 p.m. at City Battles Hoffenheim in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinesheim, Germany.
Schurzer wants to play: Spoiler v. Rockies
With citizens exempt from the threat of playoffs, there was no more reason to force another start.
Schreiser expects to make a comeback against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are playoff effects for the Rockies, who lead a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night to at least one wild card spot, but they're still trying to close their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for anything, at least we can know what the crowd is like here in Denver and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point and I will face it this year.
Why do I not want to compete?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter on Sunday, but they are ready to report the pitch of the caesar in such a situation
Scazzer, who is making his 34th debut, has a bullpen session today and will pitch his usual restful pitch on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has a 2.53 ERA this season and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings, 18-7 overall.
Trump rallies in West Virginia.
Speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president pointed to the unfortunate situation that his Supreme Court has elected Brett Kavanaugh.
What we have done in November is on the line.
The most important election of our lifetime is five weeks away.
They said, 'It's big, big - I'm not fighting but I'm really fighting, so I'm going everywhere for great candidates.
Trump said, "You can see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you're watching it right now.
And they are determined to take back power any way they want, you see the pointlessness, the impureness.
They don't care how much damage they do, who they have to fight to get power and control, so they want power and control, we won't give it to them.
They say the Democrats are on a mission to stop and stop.
And he said, "And in the last four days, you've seen angry and mean and disgusting and lying Democrats.
She referred the Senate Judiciary Committee to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who received a great response from the audience.
Remember the answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, she, what
Oh no, I'm waiting for one - it was actually worse body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
There is no universal labor church.
It is unbearable for those who speak their minds
It was no surprise when the workers of Momentums in my local party denounced me for voting.
I am the newest in a line of Labour MPs who have written that we are not welcome to speak of mind.
My fellow MP John Ryan acted in a similar manner because she was totally against Judaism.
In my case, I was criticized by Censor Motion for disagreement with Jeremy Carbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security and, in Europe, issues like these that Jeremy largely disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said "We want to make meetings inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night's GC meeting was exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today this is not the sound of many meetings and "kindness, tenderness" has long forgotten the promise of politics, actually when it started.
It has become clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and that each advice is decided on whether it is acceptable for the party leadership.
It started immediately after Jeremy became leader, colleagues I had previously thought I shared the same political views, I hope I can take the opposite positions I never agree with - be it national security or a single market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - after criticizing abuse on social media, demanding election cancellation, condemning the politics of the Centre, I am told that I should not remain in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of the businessmen who face sexual and racial abuse every day, but never feel ashamed.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is that the level of abuse has become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the universal church and every "untrustworthy" proposal or change in election rules weakens the party.
Over the last two years, I have received many advice to stay low, not talk too much and then I will be "OK".
But that's not what I came into politics to do.
Since I joined the labour movement 32 years ago as a school student, being provoked by the Thatcher government's disregard for my large school class, I had asked a local councillor or government minister for better public services for those who needed them most.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused about my policy position and any disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have tabled the resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is moving towards breakdown which will harm our families, businesses and our services, I do not wish to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party.
But I actually have no message for the Nottingham Momentum, it is for my light, whether I am a Labour member or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of disruption or political campaign will interfere with my work which I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East.
A.Y.R. 38  17 Melrose: Navad A.Y.R. Go to the top
Two delayed attempts can greatly reduce the final results, but there is no doubt that A.Y.R. should win this wonderful entertainment tenant's premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the list, only one of the ten is missing.
In the end, it was his better defense, the more likely he was to take his best chance, which led the home team and gave coach Peter Murchi full right to be happy.
"We have tested this game so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
"Credit to A.Y.R., they took better chances than we did", said Robin Christy of Melrose.
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, replaced by Fraser Climax, put the A.Y.R. in front, however, the yellow card for Scotland's Cap Rory Hughes was released via turn-up request for the game, allowing Melrose to provide the number and Jason Bagot an unknown attempt.
Klymo increased the A.Y.R. lead with the penalty, first, in half time, he scored and then at break, made a single attempt to make the A.Y.R. 17-5.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson tried, replaced by Bagot, Levey dropped to five points.
Then Ruridh Nath was put on hold for a long time due to a serious injury, which was overcome, and after restarting, A.Y.R. progressed through the efforts of Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Climax.
Blair McPherson had created a yellow card while serving as A.Y.R. Captain, and again Melrose paid an extra man to try his place by not replacing Bruce Colvin at the end of heavy pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Sturgeon Hutchison was given a yellow card for dealing with the climax to get him out of the penalty line, McFerrin touched the back of the A.Y.R. Mole.
The climate changed, as he started over again, Kyle Rowe sent Flanker Gregor Henry for a fifth attempt at home after collecting David Armstrong's box kick.
Still ready for a new career in the sports star hotel industry
Still, sports star Ford Keeran is ready to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he has written and co-created with longtime comedian partner Greg Hamfill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be at the end of the show and it looks like Kieran is planning a life after Craiglaug.
According to the official records list, he is a director of Adriftmoron Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish source indicated that Kearne was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "rich food trade".
'The sea is ours': Portless Bolivia hopes the court will pave the way for the Pacific Ocean
Malaha patrolled a regimental naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings wave an ocean-blue flag.
The seaports from Titicaca to the Amazon were depicted with the motto: "Officially the sea is ours.
To recover it is a duty".
The memory of the complete harborless Bolivia, a rugged 19th century resource dispute from Chile to the Guanche coast is still clear - as the Pacific Ocean is once again swimming.
Perhaps those expectations are the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia has a sense of speed, unity and perseverance, and is looking forward to results with a positive outlook, said an ambassador from Bolivia, Roberto Clagejilla.
Large-scale and many Bolivian ICJs across the country will see the decision, hoping that the court in The Hague will be in favor of Bolivia's claim as Chile is compelled to negotiate for free seawater to Bolivia after decades of adequate negotiations.
Evo Morales, the Christian indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a contentious battle for next year's re-election - is also very much involved in Monday's decision.
She swore at the end of August, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific".
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and if it does, it will change slightly.
The United Nations Organization of the Netherlands has no power to provide Chilean territory, and has ensured that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Paz Zarate, a Chilean scholar of international law, said that the final arguments being heard indicate that the case "was not complicated" and the ICC's decisions come only six months after that.
And in furtherance of the Bolivian causes, it has probably been reset back four years.
"The issue of maritime connectivity has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
He suggested that Moralis's poignant rhetoric has stripped him of any unusual Chilean reputation.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk about some issues for some time, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
Since 1962, the two countries have not transferred ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodriguez Valdez, former representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was too hasty.
Bolivia will bring a unique opportunity to open a new era of Chilean relations on Monday and bring about an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Kalazadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political tactic.
He said, Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to move out of the past.
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament as long as it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Re Yang Ho says he will never destroy his nation first with his nuclear weapons if he cannot trust Washington.
Ray was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to abide by the promises made with the opposition leaders during a ceremony in Singapore.
His comments are as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of resuming North Korean Kim Jong Un's more than three-month-long stalled nuclear diplomacy from Singapore.
Re says it is a "pipe dream" that has consistently allowed and can beat the U.S. at any time against a declaration ending the Korean War.
Washington is willing to declare Pyongyang's specific disarmament moves without the initiative.
Both Kim and the US. President Donald Trump wants a second event.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning unemployment which the country sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pampayo is planning to prepare for the second Kim-Trup summit in Pyeongyang next month.
The Paris Fashion Show will show a new line in the title on a high street street near you on a large scale.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely prevent sun exposure, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne opened the Sunky-sized Headline array for their SS19 compilation on the stage strategy of shining the stylish set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, unusual hats have been on Instagram and these designers have sent their impressive creations for catwalks.
Valentino was decorated with a lavishly decorated top-topped biz hat and a wide wing-like brim that covered the models' heads.
Other large-sized items include diamond pearl turmeric, a unique hat, and an pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown has expressed a unique face-to-face for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had lip-synched and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One composition with Snorkil and Anka resembled a scuba diving gear, while the other looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you make big fashion statements - you are lucky.
The spectators imagine that the giant hats may have made their way to the high street near you.
Large size hats come to the fore of La Bomba, the pipe hat with a two-foot wide edge that is seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Rajatkowski.
The cult label behind the highly unlikely hat that spread to social media made another big creation for the catwalk - a pipe-lined beach-like bag these big swimsuits a covered model had to cover it.
The orange bag of scarves, decorated with scarves and white leather handles, was embellished on top of Jacobus' La Rivera SS19 compilation at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous artist stylist Luke Armitag told Female: "I'm looking forward to big hats and beach-like bags coming onto the high streets by next summer - as the designer has made such a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for big things".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic quality, and this outstanding examination continues in 2018 with another set of results reinforced only by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), with over 30,000 students from Scotland, strive to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
The goal of autonomous independent schools is to provide their students with further and higher education, career choice and preparation as citizens of the world.
An education field that can design and implement the Bishop School curriculum, we are seeing modern languages as a popular and sought-after subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes into their mind.
If you talk to her in her own language, she will enter her mind.
It is an effective reminder that when we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries, we cannot rely on English alone.
We can see from the recent test results this year that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest success rate in autonomous schools.
A total of 68 per cent of learners had obtained a high grade A through studying foreign languages.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 per cent of learners achieved a high grade A in Mandarin, while those who also achieved A are studying German, 69 per cent are studying French and 63 per cent are studying Spanish.
This proves that support for foreign languages as a special skill in autonomous schools in Scotland is gaining, which will undoubtedly be essential for children and young people in the future.
As a choice of subject, languages, autonomous school curricula as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are now being taught elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK's Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that language skills deficiency was the 17 percent reason for employers struggling to fill jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
Languages are needed for more potential job opportunities in a broader world, these skills are needed.
Whether one chooses a profession or not, if he has learned a second language, he will benefit from such lifelong skills in the future.
A multilingual person will be automatically put ahead of the competition as a person who can interact directly with people from foreign countries.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of young people were unable to speak a foreign language fluently to continue the conversation and French is the only language spoken by a single language of double digits, 15 percent.
This is why it is more important to spend money on teaching languages to children today.
Many languages, especially those developed economies, will be developed with a good opportunity for children to get meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while other languages to be looked at by 2020 will see the UK teaching the most important languages, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, autonomous schools will always have a variety of languages to choose from, including teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish Autonomous Schools are dedicated to providing an environment for learning in schools that will prepare and equip children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At present, there is no denying that in a global business environment, that language is very important for the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Autonomous schools will continue to provide choice, diversity and skills for young people in Scotland.

Lakers to launch Sunday in Liberon, San Diego
Fans' anticipation of seeing LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lecture coach Luca Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against Denver Ducks in San Diego.
But only how many minutes will play is yet to be determined.
The official website Walton on the Lakers said it will be more than one and less than 48.
Laker reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James will play for limited minutes.
After practicing this weekend, James was asked about his "six-game broadcast schedule plans" for the Lakers.
"I don't need precision games to get ready to reach this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's time of the West Virginia rally, watch on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump's campaign rallies have started a riot in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies in the coming week, including stopping in convenient locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Confirming his petition to fill the vacancies on the Supreme Court, Trump has set a goal of building support for the upcoming midterm elections, as votes risk losing control of Congress as the months of November go into action.
Trump's West Virginia rally time tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 6 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 26, 2018.
You can watch the live online broadcast of Trump's Virginian Rally under YouTube.
This week, the Trump Supreme Court is going to address the hearing of nominee Brett Kovan, who became frustrated with sexual misconduct crimes, predicted with a Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI is probing.
But the main aim of the rally is to help the Republicans gain momentum by facing the Republicans in the November election.
Accordingly, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters, as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives", over the coming week.
A Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters, "Congress control is very sensitive to its agenda that the President will travel to the region as much as possible, we are in busy campaign season.
Wesbanko will bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the rally tonight and Pittsburgh can provide media coverage", according to a West Virginia Metro report.
The state where he won by more than 46 percent in 2018 will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia on Saturday last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Pat Morsi, who is running back in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morsi that the president has come to try to bounce him in the election", said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA moving to Sunday singles show a zeal for the fight to keep expectations alive
After the three-way session, there will be a four-person group for this Ryder Cup on Saturday afternoon.
The forward and backward movement of the game is a complete game concept but one that the player truly believes in and never exceeds.
So they'll say, where's the speed now?
Jordan Spieth said, walking around comfortably for the day, "I guess, they had a six-figure lead and now it's four, so we're moving a little further".
Europe has the advantage of advancing by more than 12 points in the game.
As Speeth says, Americans feel that while they have a lot to bounce off and get excited about in their game, there is no less than Speeth and Justin Thomas, who each have scored three out of four points and played together all day.
Spieth has been influenced by the moon to the earth and has continued to move forward as an example.
As her round progressed the screams from her throat became more intense, and when she and Thomas came down twice after two to take all four quarters of the match, an important (golf) mary ball sank.
His (or her) golf ball that won them the match on 18 balls clashed with the same screams, as he believes the American team is not out of it.
Spieth said, "You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own match".
In these games, everyone has now abandoned all this.
18 Carts to make a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, the uncontested legend of the Ryder Cup.
The unusual but lovely couples of Europe are four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only couple not to shoot a boogie on a Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon they continued to neglect the boogie and nine points went back on Friday morning.
The race and the way in which the energy of both flows from this developed entrepreneurial crowd is that they are the losers on Sunday, and no more popular player than Fleetwoods Molinari could have stopped an ambitious European's victory as the sun sank over Le Golf National.
Especially the two are in different holes at the same time.
However, the European pride remains unchanged.
When she was paired with Alex Noren, Bob Watson and Webb Simpson played Sergio Garcia, hero of the Four Balls of the Morning.
A bogey and two doubles drilled a hole in the common nine dog and the Spaniard and the Swede were never close to getting out.
However, on Sunday, no one outside your hall is there to meet you.
Four balls and four knocks are becoming more and more popular because of the impact of the pair's idea, they advised, they did not and the way in which a policy can change immediately.
Europe has played as a team and has taken a positive lead on the next and last day but this four-man session also showed that the team was doubtful about the ability of the US, especially the Stateside, to fight.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took the lead of 17-08.
Europe will take a good advantage by throwing four balls and four knockouts in the weekend matches with a 17-0 lead over the USA.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made their mark so far with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods at Le Golf National and four points.
European side Thomas Bjorn had bet to retain the trophy he lost two years earlier at Hazeltine, which beat the targeted American team 3-1 in four balls in the morning.
The Americans scored more runs in four matches, winning two, but they did not lose.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points to retain the trophy in Sunday's 12 singles matches.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row in the history of the Ryder Cup as he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational week, were the only other pair to win four of the first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they beat Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a warm-up, another more spectacular 4 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself into two matches on Saturday, had occasionally turned on talent but has now lost 17 of his 27 matches with four goals and four assists and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for four morning balls, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in January, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka by 2 and 1 respectively at No. 1 and No. 3 in the world.
A pleasant and windy day in the southwest of Paris of its kind, although Europe did not have it.
On Saturday, three-time major winners Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas set a two-point benchmark for the Americans.
They won by an impressive 2-1 on four balls over Spain's John Rahm and Lane Poller and later returned to beat Pauller and Rory McLorry 4-3 on the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to go into the singles, although Furyk's team only needs a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of second best, however, a Sunday response attack would seem to be beyond them.
North Korea says 'no way' will unilaterally drop weapons without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions had deepened its insecurity in the US and that in such a situation there was no way for the country to unilaterally abandon its weapons.
Re Ho Yang told the annual general meeting of the people of the world that last year North Korea had taken "very reasonable and harmonious measures", such as a ban on nuclear and missile tests, the destruction of nuclear sites, and the commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"While we do not see any complementary response from the US", he said.
"There will be no confidence in our national security without any confidence in America and there is no other way in which we will all unitedly surrender ourselves without first giving up our arms".
When Lee took steps to honor North Korea for taking the necessary steps, when Washington's opposition to the North Korean known complaints about the nuclear deterrent, his statement was significant, as Pyongyang has done in the past, it did not deny the bilateral denuclearization.
On June 12, Ri mentioned a joint statement by Kim Yang-un and Donald Trump, a retired US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore for the first time at a summit, while Kim pledged to work on "a nuclear deterrent on the Korean island while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea".
North Korea wanted a written end to the Korean War of 1763 but the US has said that Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call to appease the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States emphasizes the need for a nuclear deterrent first and has agreed to achieve its objective by increasing the level of pressure, and has also objected to the declaration of an end to the war, Re said.
"The idea that restrictions can beat us is a pipe dream of those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the constant restrictions are deepening our distrust".
Re did not mention the second summit talks between Kim and Trump, which the American leader gave at the United Nations earlier this week.
In the last five months, Minister Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in discussed three meetings and said: "If the South Korean party was on this issue of denuclearization and not the US, then the denuclearization on the Korean island would not have come to such an acceleration".
When he told the United Nations, however, the tone of Re's speech was dramatically different from last year. The General Assembly was unable to call Kim "Rocket Man" by "Mr. President" Trump on a suicide mission targeting the particular land of America with North Korean rockets.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" the North Koreans, praised Kim for his courage to take an unarmed step, but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions should remain in place until North Korea stops nuclear weapons.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time limit for it, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued at the UN that the defense council wanted to step up and honor Pyongyang.
While, the US Secretary of State at Pompeo told the UN on Thursday, the Security Council said: "The implementation of Security Council approvals must be rigorous and unfailing until we fully understand the final, verified nuclear deterrence".
In 2006 the Security Council unanimously lifted sanctions on North Korea in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and guided missile programs.
Pompeo met Rian-Path on the UN branch of the Re. General Assembly and later said he would travel to Pyongyang for the second summit next month.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times earlier this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, and his "sweeping demands" for North Korea were condemned in just hours.
North Korea had pledged to destroy a missile site and a nuclear reactor group at its Moon meeting this month if the US did not take appropriate action.
He said that Kim had told him that he was expecting the unconforming steps that Trump had promised a period of security in Singapore and is moving towards building common relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
This year a new course has been awarded to all its undergraduates at Harvard University to compete with the growing Macho culture of studying through caffeine-fueled 'All-Night Awakeners' to get a good night's sleep through a bid.
At the Edukasi Sabha, students are often considered the number one university in the world when it comes to general needs such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Sziesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He inspired the course to start after talking about the deprived effect of sleep on education.
'At the end of it, a girl came to me and said: 'In my senior year, why am I told this now?'
He told the Telegraph, he said that no one ever told him the importance of sleep - which surprised me.
This year, the first-ever course is being introduced to teach students that good sleep education improves academic and athletic performance as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Howard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to start the course after students experienced severe lack of sleep during the week.
A series of interactive works is included in the hour long course.
On one side is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books where the effects of caffeine and light and the effects on sleep deprivation and the performance of runners and the importance of sleep routines are explained.
In another section, participants were reported to have increased risk of heart attack, stroke, stroke and cancer due to prolonged insomnia.
Then encourages participants to think about their daily routine with a map of the campus, with an interactive icon.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of the student at once.
Professor Sziesler said, but we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to choose to smoke and know about the health effects.
Sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to the constant pressure on modern technology and students, he said, the glory of culture 'all wake up' still exists.
He said - sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, also making sure they also want to stop gaining weight, as sleep keeps the unnecessary brain in hungry mode, keeping them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemist and physical biologist who helped prepare Professor Czeisler's course, was one of his class of his first year at Harvard for last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to motivate for a comprehensive campus course.
In the next phase, he hopes, all these postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study programme before joining the competition institution.
Prof. Sziesler Sziesler has suggested that students should set alarms to sleep and wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can throw your circadian rhythm out of good condition, sleep problems may occur.
Livingston 1 - 0 Raiders: Menga round Gerrard's men down
The Rangers had another blow from the far-blue day of the competition as Dolly Menga's strike destabilized Steven Gerrard for a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team were attempting to record their first victory on the road since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team settled Gerrard's second defeat in just 17 games as the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders continued to be heartbroken by leaving eight points as manager.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' line-up was never equalled.
While the Rangers have now slipped from sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And when an item is thrown away, there may be further inconvenience in the store for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence's treatment of the injured head.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup which knocked Ayr out.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who had scored a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy when his drilled drug made it hard to breathe every time his opponents wore his good-looking dresses.
The Rangers could have had an impressive hold but Livingston did more with the ball, which they had.
They just want to score in two minutes when Menga kicked the goal of Scott Pittman sent by Allan McGregor in the first-season but the midfielder pushed his chances up.
Keaghan Jacobs met a grim free kick back to skipper Craig Halkett but his rescue mate Alan Lithgow only managed to try on the previous post.
The Rangers managed to overcome but the final third saw more expectations than confidence in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been fined at the quarter-hour mark because he and Steven Lawless were facing off but referee Steven Thomson passed the Columbia appeal by hand gesture.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had a clear shot at the title with a simple strike by Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34th minute opener could have been against the game, no one can deny that he was the only one entitled to it for his draft.
Again the Rangers failed to come to terms with a deep set-piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher pulled the ball towards Scott Robinson, who took Menga for a comfortable simple elimination.
Gerrard starred in midfield as he had revenged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch provided an almost instant effect as the winger had in the Morelos slot but the efficient Kelly ran from his line to the block.
However, Livingston was playing the exact same game of the game he enjoys by sweeping the long balls with Lithgow and Halkett to the guests, allowing him to make the long ball after the long balls of Lithgow and Hawket.
His lead could have been pulled by Holt's team in the final stage but McGregor stood right to deny Jacobs before hitting his head from the corner of Lithgow.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim because he was confused with Jacobs but then Thomson turned his attention to him.
The Geiger Counter's invention of the genus
And in our "Sunday Morning" birthday, now a page: September 30, 172 - today, 1337 years ago, and counting... the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in the physical Germany of the future.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention later known as the Geiger Counter instrument.
Since a major science landmark, the Geiger Counter also became a pop culture landmark, the 1968 film "Bells of Coronado", which seems likely to have starred scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "Who in the world is he?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms being radiated in minerals".
Evans: "Say, it's popping up right now!"
"Hans" lived a few days after his 33rd birthday, Geiger dying in 1946.
But the invention that bears his name.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to check for damaged cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to examine and kill damaged cells.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to identify damaged cells as a cure
The procedure involves removing the patient's immune cells, transforming them into a laboratory.
They can then 'see' a protein that can be common to many cancers and then inject again.
One trial vaccine is showing increased results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify damaged cells has been found to have had ovarian cancer for more than 17 months.
The procedure involves removing the immune cell from the patient, converting it into a laboratory so that it can see the HER2 protein in many cancers, and then inject it again.
"Our results suggest that we have very good vaccines", said J. Berzowski, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Balisda, Maryland.
Professor Berzofsky explained that "HER2 drives the development of many cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer".
A similar effort to extract immune cells from patients and "teach" them how to target cancer cells is underway to treat leukemia of a kind.
Kanye West began to criticize a pro-Trump, wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
This did not happen.
Kanye West was called to the studio after a spectacular performance during Saturday night live in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would fight for the government in 2020.
After her third song performance at Ghost Town at night, in which she wore a hat that called America great, she boasted of her support for Democrats and Trump.
"Sometimes I talk to a white man and he says: "He's racist, how can you like Trip?"
He said, "Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America long before that".
SNL launched the show with a preview in which Hollywood star Matt Damon mocked Brett Kovan's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Christine Blaise Ford over allegations of sexual assault.
The footage of West's pride was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock, though it was not broadcast.
Whether Rock was trying to joke with West Posting is unclear.
West had also complained to the audience that he had faced a troublesome clock behind the stage with the head restraint.
"They pushed me behind the stage.
He said, 'You don't have to go out there wearing a hat.'
They bothered me!
According to the Washington Investigative, he said, and then they said, "I'm in the hidden place".
West grew up: "Do you want to see the hidden place?" He said, "My Superman will wear the hat, because you can't tell me what to do.
"Love is the key to life".
Her comments and audience were shocked at least twice and SNL's elected members were embarrassed, with one person reporting the publication: "Sannah was shocked in all the studios".
West was later replaced by singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of I love, dressed like a perrier bottle.
West gained support from the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Tinner who tweeted: "The most courageous feeling: Thank you for standing in front of the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is "just who he is and it's completely naked".
I believe that embracing and swallowing an ideology that is harmful to my society, "but I did not choose to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or by calling them 'artists')
He is free.
He said, "We are like that too".
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name before the show, saying he was now known as "generally Kanye West".
Changing his name, he is not a first-time artist and follows in the footsteps of D.D.'s map, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy Daddy and P.D.D.
The fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, is named Snoop Line and of course the celestial music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and the UDO artist was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of intentional murder with knife at Belfast restaurant
A 44-year-old man was charged with murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, police said.
The defence is likely to present the Billfast Judges to the court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Kit Harington, the artist of Game of Thrones, has criticized the vast masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the hero, 31, has influenced the legend of Macho Hero, saying that such roles on screen mean something to boys who often feel they need to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something has gone wrong' and how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 13, admits that she feels 'very nervous' about addressing the issue.
He said, 'At this moment, I personally feel quite a bit, - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?'
'In view of the problems now, what are we teaching men as they grow up?'
Kit believes that television can be considered to some extent the answer to the rise of broad masculinity thanks to its large masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is normal and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have some of these side effects as a man?
How can we change this? I think it is really one of the big questions of our time.
Because something is clearly wrong with some young people.'
In the meeting he also admitted that he will not be doing a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones at the end of next summer because 'he has had enough of battlefields and horses.'
Kit will star in the True West revival of Sam Shepard from November which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a bandit.
Recently, the hero revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best way to get out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on this show, and thus it gave me my future family and thus my life has grown'.
Rose Ygritte played the love interest of the Kit character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
In Scotland, the couple married in June 1918 in Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China has seen a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 7,25,750 people are affected in the country.
Approximately 44,5 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2017 alone.
There is a shift from the past when a large number of cases were transmitted through intercourse.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province, but thus the number of people living with HIV had been reduced to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 17,5 million people year-on-year.
A serious issue in China's LGBT community is transmission of HIV through intercourse.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1917, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
The transmission of many diseases leads to insecure sexual security.
Since 2013, the Chinese government has pledged to make efforts to address this issue as part of the widespread availability of HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denied that staff members have leaked data, explosions, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
US Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of members of the law-making body.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims were being handled by "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter, "Lies, lies and other reprehensible lies".
Information released by home addresses and phone numbers for the U.S. is included. Sines. Both Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Uta, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch.
Information posted by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was seen online on Thursday.
The secret of this information was discovered shortly after Kawanhof was questioned by three senators.
According to information from Capitol Hill, traditional sites like Gateway Experts and Red State reported that IP addresses identifying the source of posts were associated with the Office of Waters and a member of the Waters staff was also notified.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a gross lie", Waters added.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information and security compromises have resulted from these fraudulent and false allegations - were not responsible in any way for uncovering the mystery of this information.
These baseless allegations are completely false and a gross lie".
Waters' statement was soon criticized, including former White House press secretary Ari Fliser.
Flescher wrote, "This denial is annoying".
"It shows that he has no inclination to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
They should not feel guilty.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and calm".
Flescher appeared to be comparing criticism of Judge Kawanhoff by Democrats to Waters' reaction, who critics had accused of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Nawar also expressed his opinion on Twitter to remove Waters from the membership in the midterm elections.
"Big if true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and law-transformation bodies of the fraud claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he added, "and they will be held legally responsible for their actions which are destructive and dangerous to any of my employees and all employees".
Johnny English reviewed - Rowan Atkinson's spy spoof was underestimated.
It has become traditional to see the Brexit significance in any new film with a British film and this applies to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with the well-known English Reborn.
Are we going to make a false self-evident fool of a subject? We are the new export opportunities of the country.
At any cost, pop-aid, Berocha Aksham Johnny English has a license to start over for the second time - his name suggests he is a comprehensive comic creation designed for non-English-language cinemas.
He is certainly a draft secret agent who, despite his apparent disdain for Mulyam Glamour, had a little clown, a dash of Mr Bean and a face contributing to a note for Fire Thunnoyade's chariots at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It is essentially based on the mystery of the traveler and international figure, who Atkinson once played in the now-fargoton barclayscard TV commercials, leaving him in a mess.
There are also a good moment or two in this latest JE outing.
I liked Johnny English coming to a helicopter, wearing a coat mid-collar suit and rotary blades rolling against his helmet.
Atkinson's skill for physical comedy is on display, but humor rarely and oddly makes him feel overwhelmed, especially as "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible present themselves now as a factor with confidence.
Humor makes it feel like it's pitched to kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's sneaky drills are not uncertain and the Atkinson-focused gags in Bean's personality are.
The long-standing situation is that Great Britain is now in serious crisis.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the region, leaving the agent on duty - an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final trinka for a Prime Minister, an outwardly complete and front-facing person who has already broken completely on the threshold of political oligarchy: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Quasi-Theresa-Me character but there is not much to work with the script.
His intelligence advisers informed him that as every active detective has made a compromise, he will have to bring someone out with the help of the servants.
And that means fighting Johnny English, who is now employed as a schoolmaster in some fashion, but is teaching off-the-record lessons to become an undercover operative: Here are some good guys, like English School of Rock-type Spy Academy.
English was sent back to White Hall for emergency briefing and re-enacted by Ben Miller with his previously long-suffering Siddique Bowie.
Now Bo is a married man, tied up for a submarine commander, a net-hockey-sticks role in which Vicky Pepperdine has been a bit of a mess.
Thus Batman and Robin are faced with being badly mistaken by Her Majesty's Secret Service, Olga Kruelenko meets the beautiful and attractive woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Krishma Teke is dangerously digging under the mantra of billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer crises: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bowie start their ridiculous high-zinc odyssey: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a flash French restaurant; they smuggle aboard a yacht boat to Volta; and English operates a pure mess as he attempts to use an artificial reality headset to make himself aware of the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are definitely taken out in that final sequence, but as it is capable and adaptable, there is a lot about the whole thing in the children's TV.
Beautifully modified equipment.
And with other Johnny English films I can't help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that actually judges his talent?
Labour denies that it is preparing a plan for the people of Britain to work four days a week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Carbin's Labour Party has to consider a radical scheme that will make the British people look like they're working four days a week - but being paid for five.
The party wants the company's boss employees to pass on the savings by giving extra day off to the workers through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution.
With this, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same salary.
Sources said that this idea would be "fit" with the party's economic agenda and would favour the country to workers.
The four-day weekly Trader is a way to take advantage of the changing financial situation for workers as confirmed by the Union Congress.
A senior Labour Party leader told the Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not be overnight but the four-day work is the inspiration of a week that fits with the party's vision to rebalance the financial situation in favour of the employees as well as the entire industrial strategy of the party.'
Labour will not be the first to confirm such an idea, the Green Party organised a four-day work week during its 2017 party general election campaign.
The will is not being fully confirmed by the Labour Party at present, however.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'Four days of work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party'.
Shadow Chancellor John McDaniel used last week's Labour Summit to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the financial situation.
Mr. McDaniel said that he was determined to restore the power of the unskilled directors and the profiteers from the Utilities France.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders in the sunken companies could not get their full stake back as the Labour government could have 'cut off' on the basis of known wrongdoing.
He also confirmed the plan to create an Inclusion Ownership Fund to hire employees on the company's boards and to hand over 10 per cent of the amount of private sector firms (equity) to employees, which can receive annual benefits up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy in 60 Minutes Explain whether an FBI investigation of Kwanhaw could change their minds
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Cuanho has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and questions whether the bureau's findings should be supported in any Republican senators.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelle asked Republican Sense. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would motivate them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more pronounced than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said going to the hearing, I said, I have spoken to Judge Kwanho.
I called him and after this happened, the accusation came up, saying, 'Did you do this?'
He was steady, determined, without doubt".
Graham's vote, however, seems unchangeable.
"I have made my opinion about Brett Kwanhoe and it will be a dynamite charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham said, referring to Christine Blaisey Ford.
And they could not confirm all the names he had called.
He is 36 years old.
I am not seeing any new changes.
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive line-up of stars and an equally influential mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to celebrate the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but to raise awareness for the real goal of the program to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival which began in 2012 is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that actively hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a (VIP) ticket), musicians had to complete a number of tasks, or tasks, such as emailing a world leader, making a phone call.
But how successful has Global Citizen been 12 years away from achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free music program a genuine way to inspire people to work, or is it just a matter of cliche-ism - people seem to be making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters, insisting on hosting different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies of over $37 billion set to impact the lives of over $2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or raised.
The Group estimates that safe funds have directly impacted approximately 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners "committed to helping children grow to their full potential", which has pledged to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens, we can reduce social injustice like you, a footnote in history, Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ulla told the crowd during a live music event in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 efforts to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a single plan, Nutrition Power, which will reach 5 million women and children by giving nutrition interviews.
Do you think that the answer to the question "Can we end extreme poverty?" is in the pages of this website?
The World Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fail and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-racist movements before us, we will succeed because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monay are among the exhibitors at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah Lee Fernis and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to blockade Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
According to the Washington investigator, Washington, if it can resort to its waters to deter Russian powers, including the Middle East, from entering the market "on demand", US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zincke could reveal,
Zink alleged that Russia's action in Syria - specifically, where it is being conducted at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to do energy brokers the same way they do in Eastern Europe, towards the south of Europe", he allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zink was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which presents itself as the voice of energy consumers in the US.
They will compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, seeing that it is effectively the same.
"The economic option over Iran and Russia is to replace and replace fuel, more or less", he said, referring to Russia's single-payer status with fossil fuel-dependent finances.
The Trump administration is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, Russia being the cheapest option for European consumers, the statement said.
To that effect, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, became the "containment" of Berlin and Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is a net economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's broad opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the idea that energy pressure cannot be a material for practicing and consumers should be able to choose the supplier", Russian Energy Minister Hangzhou Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has drawn back from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the leading organization for German industry, has announced that the United States will abstain from EU trade policy and bilateral agreements in Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when there is a third state interference in our energy supply", said Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will keep a close eye on the ongoing presidential election in 2020, the Massachusetts senator says.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will keep a close eye on the presidential election as the midterm elections are held.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top", Hill said.
"After November 6, I will keep a close eye on the presidential election".
Warren told President Donald Trump during the town hall that he was "leading the county in the wrong direction by saying this".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy", he said.
Warren spoke clearly in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
In a poll released on Thursday, a majority of Warren's own constituency voters indicated that they do not think she will contest in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters say the senator should not run according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Global Survey (Poll).
The rest (32) responded to this.
The survey showed more support for such a system by former Governor Devell Patik, with 38 per cent supporting the transitional system and 48 per cent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic nominees who were discussed in relation to the 2020 prospect, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin made a statement on the track during the PTSD Donald Trump rally.
Track Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his September enlistment.
He was arrested and fined in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is doing, what he will do when he comes back. I can get to know other families who feel the impact of PTSD and some of the choices our soldiers bring back with them", she told listeners at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paulin described his arrest as "a bad situation" and said of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little differently, they come back with determination, they wonder if this is the way it is for them to honor the way their other soldiers and airmen (airmen) and every member of the military has given to the country".
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with assaulting a woman in domestic violence, tampering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 States, challenge D.C. support for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of group or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district knocked on the door of the Friend of Court in Washington on Friday to support a policy-challenging asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the court is also Grace. The Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He told his partner "and his violent gang member's sons" abused him but U.S. officials rejected his request for asylum until July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
State Attorney Grace, in support of the state, spoke about El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generates a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as international states face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian Attorney General Carl Reisen said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of states, federal and international law".
The Friend of Court summarized, "It is imperative for federal law that all asylum claims be judged on specific facts of the claim, and circumstances and such bar violates this principle".
The attorneys briefly argued that the policy of refusing immigrants entry is being said to hurt the US economy as they are more likely to do "the necessary work" and become entrepreneurs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to allow asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Sharan is available to people who leave their home country due to persecution or fear of persecution or because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum has never meant solving all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
In Palo, the number of deaths in the search for the living is doubled with desperate rescue efforts.
The conditions were terrible for the living.
"It feels very stressful", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her fever-stricken child in an evacuation center in the city of Palu, the city that is also affected by Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings corpses.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen coming into their destroyed houses, picking up water-damaged items, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were seriously injured and taken to hospitals, damaged by 7.5 earthquake, they were buried under water.
Some of the injured, including Devi Harris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were placed outside the Army Hospital in Pulu where patients were being treated outside after a sustained shock.
Tears came to his eyes as he felt that a violent earthquake had moved the hotel room on the fifth floor, when he told his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I was put in the rubble of the wall, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in a town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to me and her child.
I hope they are safe".
The US ambassador accused China of "inciting propaganda".
An official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the U.S. a week later, daily U.S.-China sales trade mutual benefits, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited China Daily's Pay Supplement in the Des Moines Register - Lowa's largest selling newspaper - accusing it of attempting to interfere with China in the U.S. on November 6.
Trump has alleged that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election, while US officials told Reuters that it was a major campaign to pressure China.
However, it is common for foreign governments to advertise to increase trade. Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war which has seen them increase the level of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war China had prepared to destroy exporters in the responding tariff states (U.S. states) such as Lowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Bernstad and the longtime governor of Lova, a major exporter of agricultural commodities to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brunset wrote in an opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling by subterfuge by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a free press to promote itself through the American tradition of free speech and paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", Brunstid wrote.
Conversely, here on Newsstand Down Street in Beijing, you will find limited dissent and no true representation of the various opinions that the Chinese people can think about China's troubled economic trend, stating that the Chinese media is entirely under the Communist Party", he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most famous newspapers cleverly refused to publish an offer" in his article (article), though he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans have already isolated the Malaya voters with Kwanhoe, analysts warn.
Many top Republicans have backed and defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over multiple charges of physical assault, the analyst warned he will see a reaction during midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment around it has been so high, and most Republicans are already showing that they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things cannot be turned back", Grant Reehr, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in a letter on Saturday.
Reehr said he doubts that the late action taken by Senator Jeff Flake (R. Arizona) to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm angry voters.
Women have not forgotten what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and not even in November", Karen Jan-Pyre, a senior activist and national spokesperson for the progressive group Movon, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters said "November is coming!" as they showed in the Senate hallway that Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Kwanhoe's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Curtisini Blasey Ford. Despite Dr. Curtis' testimony, Mick said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and inspiration is going to shut down the charts", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the News Site.
"People are saying that it is already high, it is true.
But it can be high, especially among swing women (who can vote for any candidate) voters in suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29 year olds, who don't often vote when they don't like the president".
Before Ford's public testimony that there was a description of his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that there might be a stumbling block if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
"It's become a complicated mess for GOP", said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Staley, according to NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kwanhoe sits on the bench (on the bench of a Supreme Court judge), it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities America, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed to the News Channel.
Yet Americans are somewhat divided among those who believe after the testimony of Ford and Kwanhoe, favoring a little more later.
A new survey from Yugov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or possibly accepted Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or possibly accepted Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh may be lying on the record during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flack's gesture (statement), the FBI is currently investigating charges from Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and under oath that Kwanhoe had assaulted her with a syrup at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court representative exposed his genitals to him when he joined a party while attending Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web explorer is making plans to bring a new Internet to Google and Facebook.
World Wide Web explorer, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a startup that appears to be opposed by Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt is a company that solidifies the open source platform of Burns-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information people are allowed to access.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Invert is to "rule the world".
We have to do it now, he has said to start it.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology so that people can "store their personal online data" or create a POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists (lists), calendars, Sangjit Library and other personal and professional tools.
They are all available on the same browser and at the same time as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about storing personal data online is that it is entirely up to the user to access the information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources to the company, helping to make the process and appropriate skills solidly available to everyone.
The company now has a security platform from Burners-Lee, Bruce, which has been acquired by IBM, some staff agreed to work on development projects, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized app using the tools available on the Invert website.
Berners-Lee said that she and her team are not talking to "Facebook and Google" about whether or not they are in a position to introduce a complete transformation, where all their business models have grown completely overnight.
"We are not asking for their approval".
In a post on the media published on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that Invert's goal is to "provide commercial energy and is a natural system to protect consistency and a virtue to build the Web on solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the Berners-Lee Net has become an influential voice in the neutrality debate.
Even when launching Invert, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of the web", said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric was celebrated
The pastor of the only Church of England to win the Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated 100 years later in his hometown as a fighting warrior.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vaughn won the award in the raids on Bellanglais and Lehocort on 29 September 1918.
Although, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had won the highest level of British military honours.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled at a parade in Northamptonshire by her grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vaughn, said that this was a "marvelous sign", the stone would appear about 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vaughn led a "very dense fog and heavy fire from field and machine guns" across his battalion's St. Quentin Canal.
He later reached the firing line and took the line forward before a field-gun was thrown with one hand with "great bravery" and defeated three different pieces (winning).
Lt. Col. Vaughn was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughn, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "some I know I never could accomplish but something is diminishing in importance".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughn gave up flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said he was "feeling very honored to be part of the parade" and said" the bravery of a real hero was shown by the support that many people are doing".
MMA supporters stayed up all night to watch Ballet 206, instead of seeing Papa Pig (a British cartoon series).
Imagine, you have stopped all night to watch a ballet 206 pack and you have refused to watch the main schedule.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 controversies, six of which were on the main card and was being shown at night by Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, while Gezzard Moussaci and Rory McDonald were preparing to compete against each other, audiences in the UK were surprised when coverage was changed to PPA Pig.
Some were very ineffective for fighting, especially after being awake for the early hours.
Twitter and a supporter described turning children's cartoons into "some kind of low-key joke".
"It is the official rule that the content was not adequate until 6 am, so they had to switch to children's programs", said Dave Squartz, senior vice president of Martering and Communications, Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Yes" is a word that means "to be a man".
Scott Cocker, President of Ballet Company, said that they will be working on their schedule to engage UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think maybe we can work on it", Cocker said.
"But we will not be able to complete this work there until Sunday morning at six o'clock and until our time on Sunday, Monday according to their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when this was changed, many of the Scriptures became obsolete and they were not all as friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought there was a technical flaw in it.
But it was not so, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We'll put it down in five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to push the fans over the limit and we just checked it out.
This is a miserable situation".
Desert Island (Island) Discs: Tom Daly feels 'lower' than sex
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling disgusted by everyone because of his sexuality.
The 24-year-old says that he did not experience until he went to secondary school that "no one is like me".
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauryn Labrinne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give "ass" to others.
He also said that becoming a father makes him even more unfit to win the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Christie Young, has been suspended for several months due to illness.
A look at Castaway (an American drama film) on Labrin's first program, Daly said she felt "lower (less) than anyone else" who is getting older (at age) because "it's not as acceptable as boys and girls at a social pace".
She said: "To this day, their feelings of under-feeling, and feeling isolated are their true feelings that have given me the strength and power to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so when he suddenly found out about his sexuality, he didn't let everyone down.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and attended this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to other countries to exonerate homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to live openly without any opposition and wanted to "give up" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "hit me right off".
Daly performed with the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, last year but she said there was no issue of age difference.
"When you go through this at such a young age" - he first went to the Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it is very difficult to find someone at the same age who has experienced the same good and bad experiences as you.
The couple became the mother and father of a son in June, whom Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Dale said had "changed his whole outlook".
"If you had asked me last year, it was all for him 'I had to win the gold medal,'" she said.
"You know, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son has the same name as her father Roberts, who died in 2011 at age 40 while undergoing a brain cancer diagnosis.
He said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if he had tickets to London 2012 - so he could sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him (his father) 'Dad, you're not even going to sit in the front row,'" he said.
"I took her (her father's) hand and she stopped breathing. And it wasn't until she stopped breathing and she died that I finally realized she wasn't innocent", she said.
The following year Daly participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew how I dreamed of my whole life - there was no better experience than diving in front of crowds at the Olympic Games", he said.
He inspired his first song choice - Pride by Heather Small - which had hated him in the making of the Olympics and had so far stunned his rants.
He will be appearing on Desert Island Disc on Sunday at 11:15pm (BST time) on BBC Radio 4.
Poorly performing Michaelson was banned from playing in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup but he will have to come to his full form to avoid this unfortunate milestone.
After Michaelson played in the two-year-old competition for the 12th time for the record, captain Jim Furik ruled out the morning and afternoon games (balls played in the Ryder Cup) on Saturday.
Rather than being the center of the action, as he often does for the U.S., the five-time major winner split his day between becoming a cheerleader and improving the range of play while working on his game range that he felt bad about.
The most straightforward players at the peak of their career can never play, the 48-year-old tight end is not an ideal fit for a national golf course where long-rope rotating shots are regularly hit.
And if its own courses aren't hard enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michaelson will face right-handed British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who has teamed up with Roki Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, 12 singles matches are four points short of the start, don't play fast, Michaelson's match could prove to be completely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, and he could not say more.
"What he did today was fully understanding his role, he gave me a slap and put his hands around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow", Furik said.
"He gained great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added a lot to these teams this week, and this week.
I thought maybe he was playing two matches.
I thought further, but this is the way it worked and so we thought this is the way we have to go.
He wants to go there like everyone else".
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could have signaled the end of the Ryder Cup's career which does not match his personal record height at all.
Michelsen has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furik said his presence brought some strength and confidence to the team.
"He's weird, he's silly, he's funny, he likes to be tough on people. And he's a good guy to be in the team room", she said.
"I think the younger players should have gone to him in terms of humor, as well as this week, to see humor.
He gives more than just playing".
Europe captain Thomas Bajorne warns that Big Leed (an American blog newspaper) may soon disappear.
European captain Thomas Bajorne knows from his experience that a measured lead in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unsafe ride in the final day singles.
Dan played his first match at the 1997 Waldrama, where a team captained by the Sea Ballers took advantage of the Americans by five points but only winning by 14 points on 13 points on 2 1/2, finishing the winning line with very few strokes from their nose down.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Walderrama; our great lead at Brooklyn, where we lost and Walderrama where we won, but only Bjorn said Friday and yesterday saw the 5-3 winning teams at the 2018 Li Golf National taking a 10-6 lead.
So history will tell me and everyone is on his team who is not finished.
You will be bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the good things.
It does not end until you have obtained points on the board.
We have a goal, and it is to try to win this trophy, and that is where the focus is.
I've said it all together, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we know what's on the other side - the greatest player in the world".
Very pleased with how his players performed on a rigorous golf course, Bajorne said: "I will never progress in this before.
Tomorrow is a dangerous beast.
The coming days are individual performances that come ahead, and it's a different thing to do.
It is good to go there with your partner, when good work is being done, when you are actively there then you are tested for your ability as a golfer.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players, who will get the best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he should go and get the best out of himself".
Unlike Buzzorn, Jim Furyk is seeing his players perform better than his peers separately, except for Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big last days, when he was part of the winning team at Brooklyn before becoming a loser as Europe performed the "miracle at the Medina".
"I remember every bad word of it", he said in response to the question, "how Ben Cranchhaw's 1999 captain prevented his players from joining the final day race".
"We have 12 matches tomorrow but you should start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this momentum moves to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We got fully prepared in our line and put those guys in fashion that we liked, you know, we're doing something miraculous tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with leading the biggest match and facing Rory Michellroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Rahm, Tony Fleetwood and Ian Polter in the first half as other European players.
"I went with the guys in this group in this order because I think it will be fully covered", Bajorne said in his singles selections.
The new German warship was once again postponed
The German Navy had authorized the launch of the newest frigate of the German Navy in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warship. But this could not be the following year due to poor system and low cost, local media reported.
The authorisation of the lead ship "Ryanland-Pfalz" for the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing Military Spokesman (Vokata).
Vasel should join the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issue put the future of the ambitious project at risk.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels of the fleet will replace the obsolete Berman-class vessels, which were ordered back by the Navy in 2007.
It is thought to be useful for a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth techniques such as radar reduction, infrared and fast signals.
Other important features are that it will not have to be repaired for long periods of time. It should be possible to implement it when new frigates are isolated from their ports for about two years.
However, the constant delay meant that warships were being endangered asked Germany to allow power projects abroad - already that service would be obsolete when it started, Die Jet wrote in the note.
The ill-fated F1200 fighter made headlines last year, when the German Army officially refused to pay for the aircraft and returned it to Lom & Foss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Nava Sena had returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little information was available on the reasons for the return of the aircraft, but the warship was not war-worthy due to "software and hardware failures", according to German media.
The software flaws were more significant as the Baden-Wittenberg class ships would be operated by a fleet of 1,207 crewmen which is half the number of those operating the old Bremen class of warships.
It was also found that the aircraft was too heavy which reduced its capability and prevented the Naija from putting new items in the future.
The ship of the same class, the Rhine-Falls, with a tonnage of about 300 tons, is considered a twin sister ship.
Apart from the bad hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the cost of training the crew, was also an issue.
It is said that the initial cost - from €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - had risen to around €3.5 billion.
Recent warnings of the declining German Navy make it significant that new warships cannot be seized.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the army actually had "a shortage of deployable aircraft".
The official said the issue grew bigger and more important over time, as the old aircraft were removed as invalid but no other aircraft were brought in their place
He expressed regret that no Baden-Wittenberg-class warship could join the Navy.
The National Trust secretly monitors the secret lives of the spiders
A new study in an area of the Scottish Highlands reveals how bats use geography to find food
It is expected that this discovery will shed light on the behaviour of this unique flying animal and help guide future safety activities
The study, by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will include the common, sapranose peptide, brown long-eared and dowbunton spider found in Inverve Gardens in Westeros.
Recorders will be installed in certain special locations to monitor the activities of the snails throughout the season.
NHS staff and helpers will also conduct small-scale surveys with handheld detectors
Special analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the whistling sound and also what type is doing
A practical map and a report will be presented, based on which a detailed picture of their behaviour will be created on a geospatial scale.
NTS's nature conservation adviser, Rob Diver, hopes that this will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each category of bats.
This information will help in improving the conservation of forests for habitat management activities such as grassland and forests for snails and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work which affects their habitat and housing in the country.
Wind and thunderstorms, chemical treatment of fly paper and building materials, and attacks by pet cats can also pose a threat.
In fact, the spiders are not blind.
However, due to their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful for hunting than their eyes.
They use a modern echo-location technique to detect bugs and obstacles in their airway.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious for bats
It has trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation established Scotland's first and only reserve in Dumfries and Galloway-specific Thrive Estate dedicated to bats and is home to eight species of bats from Scotland's best known species
David Thompson, the estate manager, says the place is ideal for them to live in.
"Here in Thrive we have a great place for the spiders", he said.
We have old buildings, old trees and good places to live
But there is still much to be learned about the spiders, so what is being done here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to do to move forward".
He stresses the importance of checking for cataracts before cleaning these properties etc. Because any severe birth disaster could kill 48 women and young people, possibly the entire local population.
It is illegal to keep, kill, harass or destroy the habitat of bats.
Scottish officer of the Bath Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Farrell, encouraged people to help
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and for many of our species we still don't know how their population is doing".
Ronaldo denies rape claims and lawyers are ready to sue on German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo presents rape allegations against him as "fake news" and says that people "want to make themselves famous" by using his name
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Fear Spiegel, in which these claims were published,
Portugal and Juventus Forward accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Meorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009
According to Fear Spiegel's report, he is accused of giving her $33,500 to keep quiet about the incident.
Hours after the report's claims, in a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news", telling his 1.42 million followers
"No, no, no, no, no, not that".
What they said today, false news, "five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera
Using my name they just want to spread themselves
This is common
They want to be famous by my name, it's part of the job
The player smiled, adding, "I am a happy man and all is well".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Fear the Mirror, which he calls "disowned reporting based on doubt in the field of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Shirtz said the player will be compensated for "the depth of the violation, the moral nuisances, which is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights in the last few years",
The incident is said to have occurred in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2007.
According to documents filed in the Nevada Unified Clark County District Court, Ronaldo and Meorga returned to the player's room after meeting at a nightclub where the player raped Meorga
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and said he was " percent" a "good guy" but lost by "one percent"
Documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had intercourse, but the intercourse was consensual
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and was also photographed in hospital with her injuries, but later agreed to settle out of court because she feared "change" and "social humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman said she is now trying to cancel the deal because she is mentally disturbed by the incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and joined Italian giants Juventus in a $17 million deal this summer
Brexit: UK will always regret 'losing shipbuilders'
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that if the UK lost its position of being the world's leading manufacturer of vehicles after Brexit, "the UK will forever be left behind".
He added that it is noteworthy that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Bernaston near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said
Japanese vehicle manufacturer says that no deal Brexit delay could adversely affect jobs
The Bernaston plant - which makes Toyota's Oris and Avensis - produced around 170,000 vehicles last year, of which 0.3% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Bernstein-Wike Toyota.
Among other UK vehicle manufacturers, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover also expressed fears of not agreeing on border trade with the EU
For example, BMW, said that for a month after Brexit it would close its small plant in Oxford
In a no-deal Brexit, the main concern for vehicle manufacturers is supply chain-related risks.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes to build the wagons ordered from UK and EU suppliers
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 27, there may be disruption to the border, which could delay the delivery of materials by industry and lead to material shortages.
Toyota said it may be impossible to hold cargo for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, and therefore production will be discontinued
Shri Man Clark said that Theresa May's Draft Plan for Future Relations with the EU is in line with the right to prevent border checks
"We need to make a deal here, we want the best deal, which will not only give us the joy of being successful, but also give us the opportunity to take advantage of this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers conclude that the very successful installation of the supply chain needs to be kept fully operational".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but looking to the longer term, it warned that rising costs would reduce plant earnings and ultimately reduce employment.
Peter Sowalaris, who worked at Bernaston for 24 years and who is the connoisseur of the Unit Union of the plant, said that their members are also concerned about the "experimentation that if these jobs are gone, they should never come back".
A government spokesperson said: "We must present a firm and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
White House says Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed in meeting
The White House said Sunday that the ongoing battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kanoa could "delay another week" in a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates election interference by Russia and the relationships between Trump's allies and possible obstruction of justice by Russia and the president.
The issue of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general has been a topic of rumors in Washington for months, putting Mueller's freedom at risk.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein used a wire to record conversations with Trump and discussed what the possibility of removing the president through the 20th Amendment was.
Rosenstein denied the report
But last Monday he went to the White House and during these reports he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in New York City at the United Nations, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he would "not like" Rosenstein's firing, but the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and meeting were further delayed in order to prevent conflict, with the committee hearing witnessing Kavanaugh and a woman, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh and again delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday
Asked about the meeting, Rosenstein said: "There is still no date set for this meeting, perhaps this week, I can see that due to the rest of the things going on in the Supreme Court this meeting can be pushed back another week".
But we will look at it and I always like to give the press the latest news.
Some journalists go against the claim: Sanders has not held a single White House press conference since September 10th
Host Chris Wells asked why
Sanders said the reason behind having fewer press conferences was not to dislike the TV journalist, "so much", although she said: "I can't deny the fact that they are too high up".
He then suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
He said, "The President has more question-and-answer sessions than any other President", without presenting any evidence, he added: "We have seen this number".
"But if the press gets a chance to ask questions directly to the president, it's much better than talking to me", Sanders said.
We are doing a lot of work to do this and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks and there will be a press conference where you can speak directly to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at press conferences with celebrities
Press conferences alone are very few
This week in New York, the President may have shown why a free and sometimes bizarre manner of dealing with journalists should be taken into account.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fear
The Health Secretary writes to the EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and expresses their desire to remain in the post-Brexit period
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter when it took less than six months for the UK to leave the EU
The Scottish Government had already accepted the charge for applications with settled status for EU citizens who were working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The whole summer, with the UK and EU retreating, talks continued, the likelihood of decisions rising towards autumn
The UK government is stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario but
I know this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you brothers
Therefore, I would like to reiterate that I fully appreciate the ability of each member of staff regardless of their nationality.
The EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Mike Og of Tennessee reported that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury when he lost to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday 31-02
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before mid-time.
"He came to the side line and there he got kind of stuck", Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave him oxygen on the side line before putting him on the stretcher and took him back for further evaluation
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of Nashville, Tennessee, that Vanderbilt Medical Center was out of the unique Abercrombie surgery.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/depth of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirted, sophomore high school student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of 6 tackles before leaving the game on Saturday, bringing his total tackles for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty on purchases of properties in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty on purchasing properties in the UK and this higher amount will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory scheme
This step will undermine the success of the Coarbine move to attract young voters
Stamp duty increases will be imposed on non-payers of taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £127 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty on purchases of property in the UK and the higher amount will be used to help homeless people
The move would undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's move to attract young voters and provide affordable housing to the poor and target the rich on the other hand.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK and with extra money the government will fight the harassment of people sleeping without the need to be at home
Surcharge - which has to be paid separately from stamp duty, which was increased over other houses and renters by purchase two years ago, further increased to the current three percent
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £128 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of London's newly built buildings are bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it even more difficult for first-time home buyers to get their feet on this ladder
Many affluent parts of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" as many foreign customers spend their time outside the country
To allow young people to easily buy their first home, the stamp duty for young people was reduced by Boris Johnson and the new policy came only a few weeks after that.
He accused the big construction firms of not using them by buying land to keep land prices high and urged Mr. Mati May to remove quotas from affordable homes to prevent Britain's "disgrace of homes".
Mr. Korbain introduced eye-catching reforms that ended rent control and "no-fault" eviction
He also wants to give more powers to the councils to build new houses.
"Last year I said I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to reviving the British dream - life must be better for every new generation", said Mrs May.
And that means we are repairing our fallen home market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and spend their whole lives here.
However, it is not true that individuals or foreign companies who do not live in the UK can buy a home here as easily as hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of buying a home has become a long-term one and sleeping without a home has become a reality for them.
Jack Ross: 'My last wish is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate dream" is to become Scotland's manager by reaching a stage
Scott, 42, is working on the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which is now third in the league, three points behind the first
After leading St Mirren to the Scottish premiership last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-cap and it was over", Ross told BBC Scotland's Game Voice.
But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampden, and it was something that always drew me back.
But, this opportunity can only come if I succeed in managing the club.
Ross's ancestors as Sundarland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allredis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and the likes of Paulo Canio
The former Aloa Athletic boss said that after being banned from Barnsley and Ipswich Town earlier, he felt no shock from such established names at such a big club.
"At this point my success will be predicted by 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League'?"
"Given the structure and facilities of this club, it should join the Premier League without a doubt", he said.
It is not an easy task to take the club back there, but I will probably consider myself successful here only if I can bring this club back there".
After 15 months of coaching staff training at the assistant boss and Hart's in Dumbarton, Ross has only had three years in a managerial career.
He then knocked Aloha out of the third tier or saved him and led St Mirren to win the championship title that season.
And Ross said he now feels much more comfortable than his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
Referring to Aloya's taking on responsibility, he said "it is possible that this was a real cholera".
I really believed that more than playing, management was right for me.
It may seem strange because I recovered, led a meaningful life, and enjoyed some high joys.
But playing can be difficult
You have to do a lot of things on a weekly basis
I still go through the stress and job pressure but management still seems fine.
I always wanted to organize and now I am doing it, I feel most comfortable now in my entire adult life as I am now in my own skin

The heat of summer has increased efficiency for Britain's struggling pubs but put increased pressure on restaurant chains
Pub and Daroo contract group sales rose 2.7 percent in July - but fell from 4.8 percent in restaurants
Peter Martin, CAGA's business adviser, who produced the figures, said: "Due to the continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup, July was the same as last month, with contracts up 2.8 percent but the restaurant's condition was further strained
Restaurant business decline of 1.8 per cent in June worsened further in July
The pubs and bars serving alcohol were much more popular than the stores, and the restaurant was in a similarly poor condition.
The catering pubs also burned in the sunlight but not as dramatically as the restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
For this month, the sales of liquor in managed pubs and contracts increased by 0.7 percent but the food lost by 3 percent
Paul Newman, RMS of Recreation and Parks experts said: "These results have been seen since late April that are still ongoing
The impact of weather and major social sports competitions is greater on market out-of-home or out-of-home sales.
It is no surprise that the ongoing struggle for the restaurant group will continue to grow as sales continue to fall by 4.8 percent year-on-year and additional expenses on it are making the situation even more painful.
This long heat has brought a bad time for food-based operators and time will tell whether or not they are getting much needed relief at the moderate temperatures we observed in August".
Total sales in July this year, including new open pubs and restaurants, increased 2.7 percent, indicating that work is slowing for the brand

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One survey shows that, among young children up to age 11, one in five have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 2,400 secondary school children has shown an increase in "fake Insta" pages
This news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of students said they have a "major" account to show parents
Of all the children under the age of 11, one in five has a secret social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of secondary schools in 2015, showed an increase in "fake Insta" accounts - the photo sharing site Instagram has seen a rise in children's interest in Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
One hundred students say they use a clean "main" account to show parents, and they also have their own personal account 20 percent
The mother, who accidentally reached her 13-year-old's secret site, noticed that a teenager was telling others on that site to "rape me"
Research conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of which had personal accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is very disturbing that many young people are creating online sites for themselves where parents and teachers cannot find them"
The Scottish Athletics Board will have the voice of the athletes, Ale Doyle.
Ale Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body at the Board of Scottish Athletics
Doyle is Scotland's best-regarded track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty called it a great move calling it a great opportunity for those who can benefit from Doyle's extensive international experience.
"Alie is highly respected in the Scotland, UK and World Athletics community and we are confident that her involvement will greatly benefit Athletics in Scotland", said BT.
Doyle said: "I am very excited to be the voice for athletes and I hope to lead the sport in Scotland and help it move forward".
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 2016 Games in Atlanta, was unable to walk due to a temporary ischemic attack and has now become a BCC specialist.
She tweeted: "A month ago today I had a stroke
I can't walk
Doctors said that I will recover or not and if I do, how much I will recover, only time can tell.
It was a terrible job, but now I am completely healthy, I have learned to walk from the beginning and today I am drilling!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertisement that compares breast milk to cow, distributes in online poll
A breast pump company has shared ideas online with an ad that compares nursing mothers and cow's milk
To mark the beginning of "the world's first silent pump worn on a mattress", consumer tech company LV released a talk-in-language music video-making ad, offering mothers the freedom to use it.
Four real mothers dance to a song in a cows' furnace, with the lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you won't see a tail" and "If you haven't seen these aren't thistles but my mummies are"...
The song continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm breastfeeding my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm breastfeeding my women"
However, the ad posted on the firm's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, many of whom are saying it reflects the dairy industry's "horrible" light.
"The decision to use cows in the advertisements of this product is very wrong.
One wrote, "They have to get pregnant to give birth like us, but their babies are stolen after the birth days".
The LV breast pump fits properly into the nursing bra (LV/M).
Another commented: "It is a mental stress for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to raise their children?
Another added: "This is a far cry from the understanding of the world.
Others saved the ad, a woman admitted that she found the song "pleasing"
I think this is a talented idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would have taken one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
One wrote, "This is a talented product".
Another commented: "It's a fun ad that's aimed at mothers who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "going to the bathroom".
This ad is not praising or denying the dairy industry"
In late, a group of women reveals that they were dancing with pumps mounted in their bra videos
The campaign is based on the notion that many women who use pumps feel like cows.
The LV pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes on it and comes comfortably inside a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move, grab their babies and go out anywhere while pumping.
Anna Ballarin, Mother and Partner and ECD commented: LV Pump is a revolutionary product that was worthy of such a bold and bold start
Drawing parallels in women and dairy cows, we wanted to express it in a fun and complete way, taking into account all the challenges associated with breast pumps, in which we also showed the wonderful sense of freedom given by the pump.
This is not the first time that LV Pump has made headlines
During London Fashion Week, a mother of a two-year-old using the product, a designer for Marta Jakubovsky, saw the cat walk around.
Hundreds of migrant children peacefully moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
While the monthly number of children crossing borders has been temporarily maintained, the tough policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to give children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have come in the undocumented manner themselves, and claiming any child is a fear of jeopardizing their ability to live in their country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their family would have to submit fingerprints and this information would also be shared with immigration officials
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor minors
The agency later confirmed that the first 0.3% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"% have persons who are sponsors or family members of sponsors, living here illegally, and many of them are criminals
So we will continue to pursue those individuals", said Mr. Albanes.
According to refugee workers, authorities introduced new rules to speed up the process of children, in which they must appear in court within 1 month, not 60 days after their detention.
Many people, instead of meeting in person, will present their case to an immigration judge for legal status via video conference call only
Those who will be deemed unfit for relief will be expelled from the country immediately.
According to reports from refugee workers and the few months after they left the system, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, leading to violent explosions or attempted escape by them.
Lawyers say such concerns may be in a large place like Tornillo, where the signs of child struggle are more likely to be ignored because of its large size
He added that sending children to the tent city by not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can shock them which already are struggling so much.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'lum also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war was now in its eighth year
Ma'allam, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, were illegally on Syrian soil, and "will be dealt with accordingly"
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Ma'lum stressed that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 37,500 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until we clear both terrorist groups and no illegal foreign presence" from Syria's Syrian territories.
There are some 2,400 US troops in Syria, who are primarily teaching and advising the Kurdish army and the Syrian Arab resistance to President Bashar al-Assad
The country's war-torn land also includes more than 17 French troops.
On the issue of refugees, Maullam said that conditions were good for their return and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading unusual fears to encourage refugees to stay away
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They are making a question that should be entirely humanistic political.
The US and the European Union have warned that there will be no rescue aid for Syria until a political agreement to end the war between Assad and the opposition is reached.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey has created an opportunity to move forward with political dialogue with the establishment of a free zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold
The Russian-Turkish deal helped Syria by the Russian military, which prevented a massive attack on the province where 35 million people live.
Ma'lum stressed that the agreement had a "clear time limit" and hoped that the military action would target ships, including Nusra Front fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda, which would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of government and opposition members soon to draft Syria's constitution and pave the way for elections in the post-war period
Ma'lum laid the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the panel's task would be only to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any other interference
Why will Trump win a second time
By this logic, Mr Trump will win re-election in 2027, unless, as many independent viewers may expect, his condemnation and no condolence ends his presidency ahead of time.
Without a doubt, "the most dramatic end of a president will be"!
At this time, there is no sign of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the prime time figures have doubled to over 18.5 lakh on CNN and nearly tripled to 17 lakh on MSNBC
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average prime-time viewership of 24 million, up from 18 million four years ago and, MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has been ranked highest in cable ratings with 34 million viewers on news headlines on nights.
The host of ABC drama, "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol collapse, Neil Baer, said, "It's a fire that people are being pulled towards because it's something we're not understanding".
Neil Schuwell, an accomplished comedy writer and author of "Only the Funny Part: and Hollywood Boys " Club" has some other theory of the hard truth about intrusion.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2017 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump
Why? He asked
Miss Scowell told me that she said, "He makes me laugh".
In this turmoil, recreation is important.
Of course, unlike on TV and some other things, stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and what will happen to the global economy.
A pleasure is being created which can be enjoyed only by the most qualified audience
And yet, when you confront a panel of experts for six hours on the use of "deep background" in Bob Woodward's book "Fire", Paul Manfort's $17, a leather bomb jacket (a thick dress, the Washington Post said) and Stormy Daniel's impact on Mr. Trump's physical analysis, you find yourself more than an informed citizen.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheel House Entertainment and creator of "Pone Stars", said of Trump's dramatic shift in cast and daily cast roles (choice a fight with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un) that "what he's doing is like a real drama because he's not giving you anything every night".
You cannot leave a single context or you will be left behind
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a 10 degree sunshine outside his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was busy watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
Brett Kavanhof was present to face the Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's future hanged, so he could not get away with it when he was
Mr. Fleiss told me, "I remember when we were playing crazy dramas all day people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'
I thought it was a joke, but it actually turned out to be true.

The outward money comes like a flood in the very difficult middle class election race.
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania is seeing a flood of money in the 18th, once again connected congressional districts, because of two officials running for the same seat.
The recently reconstructed suburban Pittsburgh district targets Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring
Lamb is running against second incumbent Republican Keith Rothfuss, from the current 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is heavily integrated with the new 17th District.
The maps were recreated when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally given in favor of the Republicans.
The new 19th race started a financial campaign contest between the main party Finance Arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC)
Highly viewed, held in March, after a very close victory in a special election for Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania
For more than a decade, that seat was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district by a margin of 27 points.
Political experts took a slight stand for Democrats
The US thought of punishing El Salvador, a Chinese aid worker, but then backed down.
Ambassadors noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama, with little support from Washington, have already recognized Beijing
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Verella of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization management team was dismissed by the associates.
Earlier this month, Heather North said in a statement that State Department officials decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "new decisions to recognize Taiwan".
But the fine was imposed only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $1.44 million in aid for drug control, development and financial assistance to the US.
The fine, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, could have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings increased, North American and Central American officials delayed action at a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to focus on a similar rally last year, which was held to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear the conference must move forward and any ideas on El Salvador's sanctions if left over should also be completely abolished.
According to the diplomats, based on the indication of import of administrative places in the collection, Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference scheduled for mid-October.
And without receiving any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington, the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic.
For Mr Bolton, the White House spokesperson refused to give details of the debate among three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of secrecy.
Their accounts were verified by an outside, but very close, analyst of the administration, who also made a statement on condition of secrecy.
The study's past
The next shoe to fall, special counsel Robert Mueller's report on obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, may now contain very significant evidence in public records
Mr Mueller is also investigating whether Mr Trump's campaign with Russia is a kind of attack to take advantage of our election.
If the Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will be in front of the voters as soon as possible and perhaps eventually in front of a panchayat of his own few comrades, he will have to be held accountable.
There are many questions, and I am not saying that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable - nor his peers in Europe.
We all have to choose options on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1937, if the West had supported the resistance to Hitler and the Czechoslovakia in Munich, German officials were willing to adopt a dictatorial policy against Hitler.
We failed and missed the chance to survive so many years of slavery.
History revolves around such strange twists, and the unusual movement of democracy becomes faster or slower.
Now Americans are facing many such strange twists and turns.
What will we do if Mr. Trump ousted Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fortune to investigate Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been living in boiling water since the newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and predicted he would be ineligible for office
Mr. Rosenstein says that it is unusual for The Times to say this.
If the new FBI investigation demanded by Brett Kavanhof was not complete or impartial how would we respond - or if it was not proven wrong in the Supreme Court despite solid accusations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the middle to which Mr. Trump is accountable?
If we fail these exams, democracy will last for a long winter.
But after the lesson we learned from Prague, I am convinced that we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported by the same Nazi regime that once seized my embassy.
I survived, moved to the United States, and, ten years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about my future?

Ranger Graham Dorn's optimistic ahead of the clash of Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna learned on Thursday that after a remarkable draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, with a win against Austria they would be in a strong position to advance from Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dornes from making his debut until the draw with Villarreal in the 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to jump to bigger things.
"It was a good thing for us because the Villarreal are a very good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing that we could get something and came up with a point.
We might have finally pulled it, but, overall, maybe the draw was a fair result.
They were better in the first half and in the second half when we came out we were better
Thursday, another big European night is
Hopefully we can score three points but it will be a difficult match because their last match was good but, behind us there is a crowd of spectators who are with us, I am sure we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Due to my injuries and all the changes in the club, the last year was certainly difficult, but now there is a factor that makes me feel good about this place.
It's great and the guys are really enjoying it; the practice is also great teamwork.
Hopefully, we can push forward this time, we can succeed leaving the previous season behind us".
Women are losing their sleep for fear of their retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a perfect idea of how they wanted to be treated, some people were still discussing it with their family members
In a nationwide study, nearly half of the individuals said they were talking to their spouse about long-term care costs
Only 10 per cent said they had spoken to their children about it
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking any steps to negotiate", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Business.
Where to Start
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not express your wishes ahead of time, you cannot prepare your family to care in this way
Discuss with your counselor and family how and where you want to get care so you can determine the cost, as this is an important factor in setting costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you by providing ways to pay those expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy that covers these expenses or, as long as you have money, you can self-insure with your own property
Remove your legal documents: Stop legal battles
Get a healthcare volunteer so you can hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care, and if you become unable to speak, make sure that the professional will follow your wishes.
In addition, think about your financial authority
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure that you continue to pay your bills even if you become incapacitated
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and they are on their way to the hospital
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Keep these words in writing so that you will always be ready to speak
"It's not just a game of money, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What Are Medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?

Federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty for suspected perpetrators of the New York City attack.
Federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty for Sefullo Sapow who is suspected of the New York City attack that killed eight people, a similar sentence has not been handed down since 1953.

It has been many years since the Southern District Court of New York sentenced the death penalty in a penalty case.
Defendant Khalid Burns was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last after death sentences were given in 1953 New York Federal case Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple committed 2 years ago in a plot to forge for the Soviet Union.

'The Chechens are disliked by the general population, the opposition will not vote for it, it is against our colleagues and our activists who really pound the boulevards and we are elected in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.'

Warren is planning to make a 'fun appearance' on the race for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "bring tears" to run for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a city corridor in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
President Donald Trump's incumbent, GOP State Republic, is running for re-election on November 1 against Geoff Dyahall, who was Trump's co-host of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.

Russin Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is the centre of attention after winning Sebastian Vettel at the request of the group
From the minute of welfare bucks qualifying in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that Mercedes "will have a huge impact on the demand for the group".
From the bottom, Butts got off to a good start and pushed Hamilton out to dry as he prioritised the identity of his two boys and welcomed Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel first went to the pole and Hamilton was left to keep moving in traffic at the tail of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes later made a lap and withdrew from the vintage, but Hamilton moved on after some wheel-to-wheel activity that saw the Ferrari driver left unattended and beat the third corner.
Max Verstappen started off with the back line of the framework and was seventh before the end of the Principal Lamp on his 21st birthday.
He then went ahead with a large part of the race as he put his tires to sink the fast-paced Kimmy Ryokanen for the championship.

It's a difficult day in which it's clear that Valerie has completed an incredible job over the weekend and she was the real man of her word.
Hamilton said the group has made such a pair equal to one.
It was really very vicious physical language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, saying he did not dismiss Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault in a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the announcement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that the individuals were "meaningful and horrible and inappropriate".
"One thing that can happen and the amazing thing that's been going on in the Senate over the past couple of days, when you get angry, when you see people who are angry and mean and horrible and vague", she said.
"When you laugh at the discharge and the hole and then they say, 'I didn't do it.'"
I did not do that".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the paper - "He, she, what?"
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak".
Okay, hold on a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak", he was involved in the senator's influence.
Feinstein was described by Ford back in July as a claim against the Cowan Foundation and was released by the end of September - although Feinstein denied it had originated from his office.
"I didn't hide it, Doctor. Ford's claims, I didn't leave his story out", Finstein told the panel, The Hill reported.
"He asked me to keep it secret and he kept it as a classification".
But his refusal did not sit well with the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you how horrible physical language that was.
It may not have been, but it's the most essential body language I've ever seen".
Advancing the Supreme Court challenge, which held three women responsible for sexual misconduct, the president proposed that Democrats were using their own end-of-life claims.
"They are solutions to regain control by any and all necessary means.
You see that the filth, the intimidation, those who hurt them, don't care who they need to keep running to get power and power", Mediatite told the president.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars had offered compensation for the Elite League's misfortune on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
Giants Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulieuir make two main goals in the wake of the attacks.
Dwyer led the Giants before Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kooney brought the home-base level up.
Two luxes were adapted for Dundee by Francis Bouchard before the purposes of Lundwald Nelson.
It was the ruin of the third Elite League's Adam Cafe Men's period, who fought off the famous defeat to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Saturday night.
It was the fourth time the two sides had met with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's slam came at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFall in the fourth minute, which was helped by David Rutherford as Beauvailler took the lead after 4 p.m.
In an open start, Sullivan led the home team once again after finishing 13:10 as Matty Marquardt moved on to become the supplier for Quinnipiac's corner in 15 minutes.
Drier ensured the Giants took a lead in the primary break when he scored his second goal towards the end of the first period
The home team is reassembled and put together by Bochard and 27:37 on the rules of the string with the aim of a strategic era.
Coveney and Charles Carcarr strengthened Nelson to lead Dundee to the lead instead of the lead for the match in the frame for the second time and he secured success with a fifth-place finish in his group's final time.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.

But avoiding his life without regard to his comrades, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agang did not leave his post-nominal candidate in the uncontrollable control tower of Pulu Airport at Sies Al-Jufri Airport.
They were staying to ensure that Battic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, had the option of leaving safely.
When he thought it had collapsed he turned off the traffic control tower.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Seriat said the election could have saved many lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We had arranged for a helicopter from Klimton's Balakpapan to take him to a large emergency clinic in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him early today so that the helicopter pulled in.
"We are heartbroken to hear about this", he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear that the loss of life could reach thousands of people with the country's disaster relief office, which limits access to the towns of Dongla, Sigi and Botong.
"The toll has so far been accepted for extension as many bodies were still subject to destruction, while some were not ready to receive", said Office Representative Suto Purvo Nugoro.
Waves reaching six meters have crushed the plum which will mass on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are receiving support and supplies.
Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An emergency vehicle is carrying bodies every minute
Clean water is scarce.
Small scale Mandies are being looted everywhere".
John Galfund, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is vital to helping survivors but we have no clue what they will find there.
It is now a disaster, although it can be very bad".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Sunday laid down the foundation in Pulu and told the country's military: "I urge you to stay day and night to complete all the tasks of the evacuator".
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was not long ago hit by a devastating shock in Longback, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nugini has now said that a person has been missing after the crash of a water-filled plane
An airplane that crashed into a Pacific modern bridge in Micronesia is currently reported missing, after telling one of the 47 people first and the crew safely cleared the sinking vessel.
Hawaii NewsGeni said in a statement that on Saturday evening, a male passenger was unfit to be represented.
The carrier said it was working with stalwart experts, emergency clinics and agents to try to track down the man.
The carrier did not respond quickly to requests for more information about the passenger, for example, his age or nationality.
Local forces helped rescue various passengers and groups after the plane crash while attempting to reach Chuc Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The plane reported that six passengers were staying at the medical clinic on Saturday and each was in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact arrangement of opportunities is unclear.
The aircraft and the U.S. Navy said the plane left in a broken-foot wedge.
Some witnesses thought the plane had destroyed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janice said the plane had come down too low.
"It's a tremendously productive thing", said Jane.
Janes said he and others thought about how to swim through deep water to the middleman for the crisis problem on a sinking aircraft.
He said the airline's managers were cleaning and slowing down, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that improvements to the vanfife helped the nearby workers to save the water by using a transportation piston to get people ashore before the water sank 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 persons have been involved in accidents of aircraft designated by PNG in the last two decades, but none so far have been involved in Air New Zealand.
Analyst burned the woman alive at night on the timeline
The alleged evidence itself outlines evidence in the retrial of a man convicted of taking a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has long been acknowledged as an expert observer in the field of knowledge analysis.
He imagined for the jury how he had used cellphone records to correct the incidents of 29-year-old anti-Quinton Tales and 19-year-old injured person Jessica Chambers.
Roulette said she had received field information from some cellphones, which showed that Tales was with the chamber the night she passed, denying her previous cases, Clarice Laser reported.
When she noticed that her mobile phone was with the Chambers, during which time she had said she was with her partner Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Safford.
Sanford stood up on Saturday to confirm that he was not around the local area that day.
When the investigator asked if Tales was cleaning up at the time that he was in Sanford's truck Sanford said he was lying in light of the fact that my truck was in Nashville.
Another irregularity was that Tallis said he had known Chambers for about fourteen days before he died.
Cellphone records were a demonstration that they knew each other for a week.
Roulette said that shortly after the passing of the chambers, Teles deleted the chambers' texts, calls and contact data from her phone.
"He took her out of his life", Haley said.
The aim of the protest is to launch its end of moderation on Sunday.
The judge said he expressed hope that he should go to the jury for an investigation in the early days.

Another black person?!
New York Nanny has cashed in on the couple for firing a "racist" text job.
A New York mother-in-law is suing for discrimination in dismissing a couple after receiving a misspelled quote saying she is "another black man".
The couple denied being racist, deeming the trial to be "money laundering".
Two-year-old mother, Lindsay Plasco Flexman, expressed concern when it was discovered in 2016 that Gisele Morris, the new baby sitter, who arrived for her first day of work, was black.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. " She wrote to her husband in writing.
However, instead of sending it to his housekeeper, he sent it to Mr. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after a thoughtless mistake, "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flexman fired Miss Morris, who was African-American, saying that Daai, who was a low-paid employee and hoped for a Filipino.
Ms. Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home to an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for dismissal and compensation of six mahniya at a cost of $350 per day and, for which she was initially hired without a contract, was forfeited.
She told the Friday Post, "I want to show them, look, you don't do this kind of thing", saying, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple claimed they were racist and pledged to quit and said that it was legitimate to terminate Maurice's job, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after his crime.
"My housekeeper sent him something that he didn't mean to say.
He is not a racist.
Husband Joel Plasco told the Post, "We are not racist people".
Even if it was by mistake, "But would you keep your child in the hands of someone you've been caring for?"
What is your newborn baby?
Try to understand".
Describing the trial as "money laundering", Plasco said her housekeeper had only had a baby for two months and was in a "very disturbing" state.
"That you are looking for an idol?
The capitalist bank man said, "It's not a good thing to do".
The public has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, waving for their behavior and reason, although the legal case is still ongoing.
The new letter opens the secret, Paddington fears publishers readers will not tolerate a conversation
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult for a first-time reader to put himself in a position where he is in a position to put himself in before it is published.
What we know about Paddington's great success is now a lot of fun to know".
He said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was "cold-smelling" after his death last year, his father said that he had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a small bear toy, he would have been optimistic about his work being rejected.
She said her father was finally very proud of his achievement, Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
He said, "He was a very peaceful man, and he was not a proud man".
"But because Paddington loved her so much, it was just like having a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them even if it's not really what you did.
He saw a kind of success of Paddington in that way I think.
He always gave his credit to Paddington, even if it was his creation and his imagination".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
As soon as the landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors' efforts to save her life failed.
"Nad was constantly saying it was really bad", said Mr. Matti Adnan-Laproyess, "he didn't expect to do it".
"Then I got a call from Ned to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
She had been given medication by doctors to pump her heart, and was gradually losing her system.
She had died a short time ago and all this was coming to an end.
Knowing that all this was opening, I had to sit there and wait.
I could not hook or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people in that situation.
I really had to get it together".
Shri Matti Adnan-Laproyess was finally grieving the loss of her daughter, boarding the plane with other passengers - she knew the difficult hour she was going through.
He said, "No one knows".
"I put my head down, and I was crying all the time.
But it was on the flight, it's hard to describe, I felt this difficult hour of pain for Nad.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Postcards of grieving women to stop suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide have been working to save others from their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers on a Welsh bridge so can people call for cooperation.
Mr Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
She said, "I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day".
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Laidney, said her son was a cheerful, smiling, promising cook.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that his smile illuminated any room".
However, he had quit work before he died, because he was really in a dark place".
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was 11 at the time, was alone when he found out his brother had committed suicide.
"I am always worried that the impact is going to be great", said Mr. Davis.
Mr Davis prepared the cards, "So that people will know that there are people you can go to and you can talk to, even if it is a friend.
Do not sit idly by - you need to talk".
Miss Humphries, who has been a friend of Mr. Davis for years, lost her partner Mark at the age of 15 not long after her mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or sad or anything", she said.
"We saw a change in his behavior just days before Christmas.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom of the cliff - when the children opened their presents, he did not touch them with his eyes or anything".
He said his death was a big shock to them, but they have to know this: "It has made a hole in the family.
It fills us with tears.
But we all need to move forward and move forward".

Since the FBI has launched a manhunt, Brett Cavanaugh's future hangs in the balance.
"I thought, if we could really achieve something like what he was saying - the extent of time - the extent of the boundary - maybe we could bring a little unity", said Mr Man Fleck on Saturday, "saying that he was afraid the Assembly was "going away" between the pro-Saudi back-and-forth.
Why do Mr. Mann Kovanhof and rising Republican sympathizers not want the FBI to be blackmailed?
Their hesitation is due to time.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If, as expected, the Republicans lose badly, then they will be very weak in their efforts to elect the person to be elected to the highest court in the country.
To recall the White House aide to the Hon. Mr. Bush and his housekeeper Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary, George W. Bush called the senator to call, and are urging the Hon.
What happens after the FBI creates its own report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will have one constituency.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kwanhof can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and consolidate him in the Supreme Court.
Kim has been 'failed' in the North Korean defendant case
A South Korean lawmaker said North Korea has been short on defector cases to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byong-Sieug Le, citing data from the Ministry of Southeast Asian Affairs, said there were 1,127 cases of defector last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
The high tariffs for smuggling people are a key factor in the strict border controls between North Korea and China, said Mr Park.
Pyongyang has not received any official comment.
In the early days, North Dalbadlua is finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Because of the longest border with North Korea and the heavily protected military zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, more people are crossing through China.
China has treated the Dalbadluwa as illegal migration rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them home.
Relations between North and South - which are technically on the brink of war - have developed effectively in recent months.
The leaders of the two countries met earlier this month in Pyongyang to discuss the issue of disarmament.
In Singapore, this followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, when they agreed to work toward a nuclear-free Korean island on a large scale.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday highlighted the lack of progress from the U.S. to the U.S. due to the sanctions.
'Without any trust in America, there will be no trust in our national security and there is no way in the circumstances that we will take the lead in preventing disarmament as a one-sided approach,' Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kovanhof "hysterical", saying she is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kovanhof "hysterical" and said he was naturally unfit to serve the Supreme Court.
Pallosi made the remarks at a meeting Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin.
"I couldn't understand but thought that if a woman had made such a demonstration, she would say 'hysterical,'" Ploisi told the Senate Judiciary about her reaction to the testimony of Kwanhof.
Kwanhof emotionally denied the accusations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers
During his opening remarks, Kwanhof was so emotional, sometimes he cried out screaming during discussions of his family and high school years.
He explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the charges against them a "disruptive and mass character assassination", which was orchestrated by liberal anger that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kwanhof's testimony proves she could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed she was biased against Democrats.
He said - "I think he disqualifies himself with those things and the way they followed Clinton and the Democrats".
Pelosi declined when asked if he would be impeached after proven guilty of the charges against Kovanhof and if the Democrat won a majority in the House of Representatives, would he or she be impeached?
"I would say this - if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, they can't just get to the Supreme Court, but to be in court they're fine now", Ploesi said.
Kwanhof is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat he was concerned about a possible Kwanhof ruling against the Affordable Care Act or Row V Wade, as he was considered a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kwanhof questioned whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time for an anti-Semitic, biased person to go to court and expect to be like, 'That's not great'?" said Ploesi.
And women should take care of it.
For months and years of anger, it is a righteous maturity and she cannot achieve it without crying.
Miss Stynam told me 45 years later, "When we're angry, we cry".
"I don't think it's normal, what do you think?"
She added, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive, who said that she cries when she's angry, she was telling the person she was talking to, that she developed a technique, which means that when she got angry and started crying, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying".
I am angry.
And then she kept moving.
And I thought it was great.
Hanyu is allowed as part of anger expression because it is misunderstood as a matter of principle
In a male-dominated office, one of my greatest memories of my early job, where I once cried myself in a rage, was that I was caught with a sore throat by an elderly woman - a shrewd manager I always lived a little afraid of - who dragged me down the stairs.
He said to me, "Don't ever let them see you cry".
"They don't know you're angry
They will think you are sad, but they will rejoice because they have come to you".
A Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart on her presidential visit.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a busy tugboat called Mandy Business and knocked out of the race, Miss Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
He laughed to me after 30 years and said, "It wasn't a well thought-out decision".
"Seven other candidates were already in the race and they needed one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind in raising money, and she promised not to enter the race until she raised up to $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He noticed that some of his supporters who gave Marda $1,000 would only give $250.
"I'm not going to be able to do this.
When she announced the speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions. She was so filled with gratitude from the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder to raise money and target the delegates rather than the voters, and anger at sexism - she became angry.
"You would have thought I was panicked", says Mrs. Schroeder, who was told of the press' reaction to her.
"You may have thought that Clenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they're going to keep in my cemetery?
"She cried" ?
How the US-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the US and China was turning upside down, and while the war is not over yet, experts say that tensions between the two countries in the long run may be beneficial to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump had earlier this year warned of imposing taxes on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week was affected by new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing has changed the type every time, recently cut tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on US$60 billion of goods.
China has pledged to fight the American defeat and the world's second largest economy is not likely to shake up anytime soon.
Withdrawing from Washington means meeting demands, but publicly bending over to the US would be very embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say Beijing can properly manage its cards, the pressure of the US trade war can reduce the interdependence of the two economies and support China in the long run.
"The fact that an early political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that trigger economic tailspin in any country is actually far more dangerous than people have already accepted", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security who focuses on Asia in a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is 'ready' to take back refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Molema said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is very stable and safe for progress made in countering terrorism", he said.
Government continued to resettle areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy
Due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods, they are now providing all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since its inception in 2011.
Six crore people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mohlem had said that the Syrian state would have helped rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it will not accept unconditional aid or assistance for assistance from countries that sponsor the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Gola National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European crown was withdrawn as Denmark's captain Thomas Barron's team had won by 14.5 points, they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who wrestled most of the tournament, threw his T-Shot at the par-3 16th hole in the water and won the match to Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone throughout his career, giving 1-4 players a 5-0-0 lead after the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest ranked player in the European team, Denmark's Throbzor Olsen, 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Pulber of England who could play in his last Ryder Cup.
Experienced in eight Rider Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia performed best of the European winning tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been a bad year.
So I thanked Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
This is for the team. And I am happy that I was able to help", Garcia said, feeling emotional after the European victory.
She gave a torch to fellow countryman John Ram who on Sunday beat US golfer Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles.
"I think it's great to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Raham.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3
A curious figure by one of the greatest players of the time, who has won 14 titles which is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to play well except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finu, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I am proud of these people, the way they played the game.
This morning we had a bit of a collision with Europe.
We lost.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will be together again, I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to serve as captain.
You have to tip your hat.
We were defeated".
