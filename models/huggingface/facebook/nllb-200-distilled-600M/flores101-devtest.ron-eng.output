Not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered in feathers, a widely held hypothesis, but it provides details that can't generally be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's crust was brownish-brown at the top, with a light or orange color at the bottom.
The discovery also provides insight into how the feathers of birds have evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed axis, called the rahis, but exhibit other characteristic elements of the feathers  beard and beard  researchers have concluded that the rahis was probably an evolutionary development that arose after the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature control or for impressionism.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not a chicken's puff.
A trapped car that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.
The governor's office said that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspect an alleged Daesh militant (ISIL) was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was determined by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work submitted was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Archer's galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is made up of a lot of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered the presence of highly resistant to medication (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant is very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate
It is possible that some patients contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll says, and at least two were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire TB population appears to be still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at one point in South Africa.

All the entrances to the caves, which have been called The Seven Sisters, have a diameter of between 100 and 250 meters (328-820 feet).
The infrared images show that the temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that these are caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they would represent deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a little technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope indicating which candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law is more strictly codifying the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, voting ballots must be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except for those of duly numbered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness at all stages of the process.

Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered as her image was widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects.
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of prosecuting the criminal, has told reporters it will not comment further until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants drawn based on the pre-1967 Middle East border.
Other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel claims that, after the agreement is signed, it will have a continued military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by the forestry authorities, the test being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Game Hunting Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Game Hunting Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Executive Director for Park Conservation and Heritage, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given extensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to direct the country to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests, which began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to organise elections, some of which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (MECI) stated that it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more overheating incidents, which the company said were not serious.
The Minister replied, saying that the delay by Apple is truly regrettable.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Bureau said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with photos of the Philippines.
Later, photographs took the place of an elderly woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were given, it would speed up the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestling confronters also brought him a tribute to Monday.
Tommy Dreamer said that Moon was the first Queen of the Extremes. My first manager. Moon died two months ago.
Dustin Runnels, nicknamed Goldilocks, commented that the moon was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more... I love it and will miss it... hopefully it's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34% of those interviewed agree with this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle events as well as three relay events, but his physical condition was called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the pain medication he needed, which was banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people checked the discovery before the beginning of February using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supply to the earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing political folly and nonsense.
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology based on the use of satellites, as opposed to older systems based on ground radar, to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more precise information to pilots.
No additional means of transport are available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley and public transport-related parking and parking facilities are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of means of transport have called into question the possibility of organising the party with the doors closed, in the absence of the team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's cinteza, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus cintezoa, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of patterns.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and knitted.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be prepared using red raspberry juice.
The color of the juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, form a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange feeling and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every home, attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of the sewerage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Romans, bathrooms were sometimes found as part of public baths, which were commonly used by men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do it through a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space with a rocket, and scientists are using telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket, 100 feet high, to take a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing the wheel has given us is to provide us with much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them we have several medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging companion cats) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of a niche; each feline has its own role to play, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called herds.
Families are made up of one to three adult male relatives, along with up to thirty females and chicks.
The females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions' families behave very similarly to wolf herds or dogs, animals with surprising lions' behaviour (but not other large cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A full-fledged athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make long-distance jumps, and shoot with a force five times that of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion's full voice, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouting words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find animals to eat (predes) by smell, sniffing the soil to find them.
Thanks to night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move around undetected, hunting their prey by camouflaging their surroundings and then throwing themselves on prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they originate (e.g. if they move across a mountain range or river or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often be found in an environment different from that in which they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they previously needed.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say they are the same species.
This process is called species formation, which means the formation of new species. Species is an inevitable consequence and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., they expel from the lungs).
Plants produce their food from the sun, through photosynthesis.
We make our houses out of plants and we make our clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the leading predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 blade-like sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the mouthpiece, which meant that nothing that came his way got away with it.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a fork in his tongue, and his food included turtles, big fish, other species of mosasaurians, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could have faced it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included mustards, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the parch.
Another difference is that while poor men and women ate sitting, rich men liked to have banquets where they sat on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include dishes that arrived in Europe, America, or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of temples, pyramid-shaped towers were also built called safe houses.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just tables that looked straight down the street.
The land of Canaan was not forested, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was little colonized. In the Scandinavian saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he did, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all Scandinavian countries, there were many differences in terms of population, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've watched the National Treasure movie, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The following words can be found on the back of the Declaration of Independence: The original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776. The text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that in its early days the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 bill) had been kept rolling.
The indication was therefore probably made simply for labelling.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was led by the French from Vichy, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working alongside the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American forces along with the free French had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, being related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
State cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over generations, a persistent cultural footprint and reasonable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations themselves.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  the Congress being its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often noncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
It also had no authority to repeal laws and tax rates between states.
The articles imposed unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is ranked second in the world's top-ranked teams and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the island groups that Japan has, Japan is often said to be geographically an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation into Aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on the sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analog film era.
It's still produced today but more importantly, its proportions were taken over by the digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format, somewhat confusing, is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family formats) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to him.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound European states to one another, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money had caused many to question whether the principle was really being followed.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted provisions of international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any vessels from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
The answer to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its undefeated submarine war.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
The period between successive dynasties was also marked by divided provinces. The best known such interval was the Three Kingdoms Period, a 60-year period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying fighting to take the throne from the great Xian Palace.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican, nationalist system, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
So was the military, because instead of the class-based military hierarchy, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly. He used to go often to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira, located on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it exists.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, is home to several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, caves, and temples were built to honor the wives and members of the Khufu family.
The upper-shaped mark looks like a V, and the lower-shaped mark looks like a cap or square with a missing bottom.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (i.e. the part where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A feature of the bow up usually produces a softer sound, while a feature below is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to mark your own markings, but remember that the printed markings for the bow features are there for musical reasons and normally must be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a chariot, surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the windows of the chariot wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd lifted the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles before the eyes of the frightened queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest related to bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period of time during which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history spanning the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by a related logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself takes a course largely outside cultural and political influence and that technology, in turn, has effects on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of the cars.
A large number of car owners lead to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silks and spices more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of the slow channels of communication, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years old.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was developing its own style, and one of the most important developments of that time was that, after the crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often ecological system that uses preserved seeds, originating from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated from society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, manners, and arguing.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take inspiration from some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
These children are called "unrefined" or "wild children". Some wild children have been abducted by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment was due to their parents' rejection, due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
It's possible that the savage children experienced abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or fled their homes.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely from non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (in its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for him, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the drawer goes a little further.
The schematic or construction method is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The skeletons can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of skeleton, but so is the little computer guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual sketches are included in the software, and they are used to interview, provide clues and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on his own.
Children are placed in family care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, to extorting.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment that lacks food, love and education, but there are.
We see the family care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe housing, caring caregivers, sound education and reliable health care.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of children who were not covered in the home they were previously in.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Other distinctive features of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of approaching types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it can be observed whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book, "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage still manage to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination make the direction of variation dominated by one or the other of the two genetic backgrounds in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were the proteins from leaves and legumes, but they are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal feed (ackerel, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested but also provides large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Given all this, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannahs of our day.
Sleep interruption is the procedure by which you deliberately wake up during a normal period of sleep to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other biorhythmic options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can touch the light. The only thing that stands in the way of that is their own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga have been added.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically very simple, it consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, whereby the visualization of the various deities cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and be fought seriously, by delegated armies, on battlefields stretching from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans became useless almost overnight, however, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers were mobilized to create the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the oceans to the other.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first milked about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them near their homes to have easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other pastures, usually in the care of goats who were often children or teenagers, similar to well-known sheep.
Wagonway roads have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden stands, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on slightly more irregular roads of the time.
Travers were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place, but gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal band over them.
This became a common practice, but iron led to the faster wear of the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first railings made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; people began walking in a vertical position 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning right man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk in a vertical position.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils of 4.2-3.9 million years old, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten bill, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as Dunlap posters.
On July 8, the document was given its first public reading by John Nixon at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters still in existence are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many features similar to dinosaurs.
They have soaked legs and claws, lay eggs and walk on the back legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating encoded information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, respectively 0 or 1, and the naming of these numbers is binary numbers or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term gandak is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from its ancient resemblance to plumage, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer beetles and bats are nesting animals, adapted to life in their nest or host's home.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is not in their best interests or those of the child.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method, which is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one however, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers used the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
They accepted Aristotle's ideas on all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West woke up separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They've actually done two experiments marking either the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-type cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism organised around nature exploration attracts interested persons to visit natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of activities in the field include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small rural settlements to their jobs, passing by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
They're all involved in society and they use transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or bridge collapse are rare.
Why do transport systems give rise to such discontent, why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Traffic flow is unfortunately difficult to study because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to stay within reasonable constants; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonable constants and can be approximated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and partners for mating more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
That gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot spread their wings are dragonflies and ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the solar system actually revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying over eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 miles long, accumulating thousands of smaller bodies of water.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical construction mastery.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous country.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known since ancient times about some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, issued a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: water, earth, air, and fire.
It reminded me more of the four states of matter, in the same order: solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he had also theorized that it would transform into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloy is actually a combination of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You'll see that some alloys can also contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, trillions could fit in the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil lost its status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to put their hands on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new appears.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, the nuclear fission again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay at a small or no pulse.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer layer is about 70 km thick in the near side and 100 km in the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in higher relief areas.
There might be more marsh nearby because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying elements that attract people's attention or please them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into maturity.
These theories study what makes people want to do what they do and what their environment can make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's pyramid of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One extreme is trying to stay one of the boys (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people are becoming unrecognizable individuals who think they need to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a breakup between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be freely expressed.
The process by which an organisation works together to overcome an obstacle can therefore lead to an innovative process to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to bring together organisations to achieve higher performance.
The data in neurobiology is the physical evidence that underlies a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, and as such, it allows for narrowing the scope of research and defining it more precisely.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumor affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulatory models that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
While AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning and adaptation of machine intelligence.
AI research involves the manufacture of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, but some software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom, and often a teacher would love to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the solution with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while in class.
Virtual sharing of an outing in the field is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is remodeled, and previous versions are kept online, to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve student's writing ability. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, having an audience generally has the gift to change things.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog starts to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their studies far beyond the normal school day.
The proper use of blogs is able to help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to the material found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of others' writings, and outline their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka County and many others.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian excellence.
Larger portions further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that have the gift of surprising many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The islands of eastern Africa are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and truly self-sufficient continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her actual civil status.
It's good to wear a ring, but not to look expensive.
Women need to realize that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it's not uncommon to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be determined when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stick to your position (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marines, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as the White House, but abandoned it again in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around Old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajine, ceramics, leather goods, shrimp and a lot of all kinds of small items, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the easternmost part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, for out-of-town visits an information effort is required to understand the stage of the fighting that is still being waged in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the climbing of the Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla hikes in Africa.
The usual (local) cost of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used metaphorically in the sense of exotic, remote places.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger posed by desert sand.
He was one of the main hosts during the PBS special of Henry Louis Gates, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the country's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The name of the territory is Hong Kong Island and it is the place many tourists view as the focal point.
The exhibition of buildings contributing to the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glossy bar diagram which is enhanced by the presence of the waters of Port Victoria.
To get the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon, across the water.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed into reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the space that the British colonists have owned and therefore for anyone looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however - they also include some of the last remaining remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges Valley.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is inland covered by water/mud.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has become a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer patches in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-districts bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and rugged.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 No) or Punakha (200 No).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two stripes of 3.50 meters wide.
The free-standing height of the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní represented the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region also hosted other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Gigantic Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century after the Spanish conquistadors met its indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has maintained, through efforts, much of its indigenous specificity and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the Las Cañitas polo courts.
Minor tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news on the tournaments and where you can buy tickets for the polo games, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland lira (FKP), the value of which is set as the equivalent of 1 GBP.
You can change money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British Lira will generally be accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On the overseas islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will likely receive British and American currency; contact the owners in time to find out what payment methods they accept.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you have to change them before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived frost more intense than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly wet or wet seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metres from other wildlife!
No matter how docky they look, a buffalo, a deer, a bear and almost all other large animals can attack a human.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept the right distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it's good to give them their space.
Also, be careful that the smells may attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be wise to avoid strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the state of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the state of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragic naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau Movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to Auckland being between two ports. The most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all pristine beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide range of shops spread along the coast.
The main local beer is Number One; it is not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
There's plenty of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines would be better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but if you're afraid you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is espresso, cappuccino comes full of eyeballs with a spoon (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are cheap, but very good.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be found outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must be addressed first to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants choose to camp outdoors, and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to catch a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in the winter, note the location of the cabin, as navigating through ice creeks makes an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos do their best to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money they spend.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and stay in the room.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks from the home, but drinking affects judgment, and good players know the importance of being sober.
Those who will drive to high latitudes or mountain steps must consider the possible presence of snow, ice or ice temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like on dry asphalt.
During the twilight, in a very short time, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or viscous snow or condensation, or the formation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's main tourist attraction and the highlight of many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to the land travels undertaken to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow them to be seen well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalking, a road safari, or a walking trip) consists of either a few hours or days of walking.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations within Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you have booked your 2020 airline tickets and accommodation before the delay is announced, you may be faced with a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but in late March, cancellation policies due to coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥ 2500 and ¥ 130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥ 7000.
So, the wet clothes can help them dry out, and many hotels have a treadmill and a treadmill that you can borrow, even if they don't exist in the room.
If you don't have a tread iron or if you don't like to wear tread socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material heat up too much (which can cause contraction or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others, it takes several minutes.
The filters differ from each other in efficiency, and if you're worried, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
The pests can alter food, cause irritation or, in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person using physical force are not generally considered harmful.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duty in certain places.
Travelers who plan to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable sums, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions on the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, often traversing isolated and untrammeled areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves predominate.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections  in general 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is all the more important to be strictly observed.
However, oddly enough, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry products are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry products are common, apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, walnuts and other nuts.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either uscat or lichid depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
However, when used without other qualifications, the term tends to indicate food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of simple spices, with Javanese's predominant preferred tastes being peanuts, yutting oats, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stairs support the rider's legs, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
These give the rider better stability, but they can pose safety concerns because a rider's legs may get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from his shaft but remains with one leg stuck to the ladder, the horse may drag him after him when he pursues it.
First of all, most riders wear heeled riding boots and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then some shafts, especially English shafts, have safety bars that allow the stairs to detach from the shaft if pulled backwards by a rider falling off the shaft.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's most sought-after mountaineering destination, known as Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and high granite pools.
The peaks offer stunning views from their summits, and climbers from all over the world are continually charting new routes through the walls with unlimited potential.
Snowboarding sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports consisting of sliding down on snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many ski enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums in English, who organize their entire holidays around the ski in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is extremely old. We have cave paintings that represent skiing as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpack skiing: This activity is also called unmarked skiing, ski-skiing or ski-skiing.
It is a related activity, but it does not usually involve alpine skiing or alpinism, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much more rigid skiing and boating.
Think of the ski route as a similar route of hiking.
Under good conditions, you'll be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking  but very rarely will you be able to reach the typical speed for cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the well-maintained tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, and normally crossing multiple countries would mean going through repeated visa and passport control procedures.
In this respect, the Schengen Area is organised as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do so at passport checkpoints.
Similarly, a Schengen visa holder does not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen Member States separately, thus saving time, money and documents.
There is no universal definition of what items are antiques. Some tax authorities consider antiques to be goods older than 100 years.
The definition varies by geographic location, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiques, although they are smaller than similar mass-produced objects.
Raising reindeer is an important source of income among Sami people, and the culture of trade is also important for many who have other occupations.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as pets.
Nowadays, many Sami have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami area of Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romans, the word țigan is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.
If the country you are going to visit is the subject of a traveller's warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than yours, but their advice is for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and overly simplified manner compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is a generic term, used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon, which has the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbance or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of several types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, mud, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, sea blasts and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal climatic phenomena include whistles, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of the severe weather risks that affect the area as they could upset their travel plans.
It is indicated that anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone should have professional training.
An Internet search for a hostile environment course will likely give you the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, plenty of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are quite numerous, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers who plan to undergo a sex reassignment operation in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The opening up of governments to the possibility of issuing non-sex passport (X) or updated documents to match their desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies equally.
Searching checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not be expected to undergo a scan without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Returning currents are the flow back to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a rapid current can be formed to the deep waters.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion in trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the flow, swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head to a position where you're not caught again, and depending on your abilities and whether or not someone saw you, you might want to wait until you're saved.
The shock of returning home manifests faster than the cultural shock (persists less from the honeymoon euphoria), has a longer duration and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes face particular difficulties in adjusting to their native culture.
If you returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost your habits in your native culture.
When you had just left the country, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that visiting a new country involved an adjustment process.
People don't always expect patience and understanding to be needed when traveling back home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for kids in the entire area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them silently before the show starts.
You can usually hear the noise of tourists and merchants all the time, and the sound and light show seems to be from a book of stories.
The sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where a flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsular Mountains join together to give birth to this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m.
In isolated places, with no phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot take the place of a cell phone, because you have to be outside, with an unobstructed view of the satellite, to be able to make a call.
The service is often used in maritime transport, including recreational boats, as well as by expeditions requiring long-distance data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly used alternative by people planning a year off is to combine travel with study.
It's a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending university without compromising their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in a year of distance learning abroad can even increase your chances of getting higher education in your home country.
There is normally a tuition fee that is paid for enrollment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a wonderful place for canoeing. The country of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelago on its coast.
In the archipelago and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the archipelago along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you go on land only on board a ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009)
Some of the cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany, and as you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and the city tour is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if you're flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and antipathies about other things that manifest themselves in so many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help them overcome fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Delivery times are often essential in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something through the air, some routes can take days to unload and vomit.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as horseback luggage, and airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and here you are.
The obvious way to fly first class or business is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do it for you).
But it's not cheap: in general, you can expect business class to pay up to four times the normal economic rate, and first class up to eleven times more!
In general, there's no point in either looking for discounts for business class seats or class I for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and comfortable, in the context of which they charge fees according to requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from an interethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, second only to Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.

Periodic subway announcements are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, unpolished and arrogant.
Although it is often just a stereotype that doesn't fit with reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it's good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is bien élevé (well-bred).
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with ferns, sloughs and branches and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It is home to a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, laughter, wildcat and mountain coconut can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts covering their knees and covering their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer blankets for women who come unprepared, but if you bring yours, especially one in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or mother at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from the ones available at the entrance, but those clothes aren't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.

However, people who know a little Spanish may conclude prematurely that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated nowadays and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Since in their heyday light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas with favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossoms, known as hanami, have been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where prune flowers were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the imperial court aristocracy.

There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, explanations in Christian theology for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evenings during the Great Week, with congregations often meeting at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, and as a result, the giant tortoise is the main animal that grazes the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you'll experience polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, because the sky will be, more or less, dark at that hour.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem, so often, you'll be able to enjoy the stars, too.
