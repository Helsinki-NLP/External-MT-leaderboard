According to Mick O'Flynn, director of conservation and heritage conservation with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting task received a comprehensive security and training order.
Martelli is sworn in to the new nine-member Transitional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the early release of the CEP as part of the country's package of measures for the new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Some violent protests have been held in the absence of elections, some since 2011.

a study published Thursday in the journal science reports the creation of a new species of bird in the gal√°pagos islands of ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species was created in only two generations, although the process was expected to take longer due to breeding between the brown Darwin finch, Geospyza forteus, and the wild cactus finch, Geospyza conyrostris.
gold can be made into all kinds of shapes. it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be bent and twisted into a thin wire that can be bent. It can be twisted or twisted into a smoothness.
It was so thin that it could be cut into pieces that it was used as a decoration in the illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. red coils of rubber liquid are used to make a marker.
The color of the coconut juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level in a test chemical indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (so hydrogen atoms hold one proton and one electron).
combine the two dry powders, then press the ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will clash with the outer layers, which will give a funny feel and make a kind of shell.
The cities of harapa and mohenjo-daro had a flash toilet in every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The remains of the sewer system were found in the homes of Crete and Santorini in the towns of Minoan in Greece.
In ancient egypt, persia, and china, toilets were also used. in roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were gathered together.
when you call someone who lives thousands of miles away, you are using satellite.
the satellite in space receives the call and instantly replies.
The satellite was launched by rocket. The earth's atmosphere changes some of the light and views, so researchers use telescopes in space.
to put a satellite or telescope in space, one huge rocket with a height of more than 100 feet is needed.
the wheel changed the world in a remarkable way. the greatest thing the wheel did for us was that it gave us very easy and fast transportation.
he brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals, from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including large pet cats) that eat a vast array of small animals, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the field concept, a special task that prevents each cat from competing with the other.
lions live in large groups called herds, and are very social cats.
herds of lions are formed of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
The females are often closely related to each other, many being sisters and daughters.
lion packs are especially dangerous to animals such as wolves or dogs, to animals such as lions (but not other big cats), and to their predators.
The tiger is a well rounded athlete, able to climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is a member of the panthera genus, which includes the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The cry of the tiger is not the full voice of the lion, but more like the sound of a sentence and the cry of words.
If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. Almost all the animals that oselots rescue are much smaller than they are.
scientists find that oselots/desert cats are following the smell-eating animals as they fly to their location on earth.
They have good night vision, and they can move around well. Oselots find prey that is adapted to their environment.
If a small population of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population (e.g. if they cross a mountainous area or cross a river or travel to a new island where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new species will need different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than previously needed.
The original breed has never changed, they still need the same optimization as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, their similarity to other populations diminishes.
finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two peoples will be so different in appearance that they cannot be considered the same species.
we call this process speciation, which means making new species. making new species is an inevitable outcome and an important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take up the carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., breathe out).
plants draw on sunlight to prepare their food. they provide shade.
we make our homes out of plants and we make clothes out of them. most of our food is plants. animals cannot live without plants.
the mosaicurus was the best hunter of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but the other mosaicurus.
The long jaws were armed with more than 70 blade-like teeth and held an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anyone who passed by.
we do not know for sure, but he would have had a tongue with a fork. his diet included moose, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly his own offspring.
It would also attack anything that entered the water, even giant dinosaurs like T. rex.
Although we know much about their food, the Romans had strange or unusual foods, including wild lamb, peacock, horned lizards, and the dormouse mouse
another difference is that the poor and women like to have a big party where they sit down to eat while the rich eat their food.

the babylonians built a large temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the gods.
people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through festivals and festivals.
each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which was reserved for priests.
at times, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
on top of the wall was a special temple for his god.
In the hot climate of the middle east, the house was not important.
most hebrew families lived outside their homes.
women cooked in the courtyard, and stores were open-air stalls facing the street. stone was used to build houses.
the land of canan was not overly forested, and timber was very expensive.
Greenland was settled by scattered people. According to Norse sagas, Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, on his journey westward, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
however, whatever his discovery, the eskimo tribes lived there at the time.
although each country was scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of denmark, sweden, norway, and iceland.
If you watch the movie National Treasure, you might think that the Declaration of Independence is a wealth map.
However, that is not true. Although it is written on the back of the document, this is not a map of wealth.
The words "the first day of the declaration of independence, july 4, 1776", are written on the back of the declaration. The text is copied at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in his life, the largest Brahmin document (293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was folded up to fit.
Therefore, the note may be attached only as a tag.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, however, the south still did not.
It was run by the Vichy French. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had worked with the rebels instead of fighting them.
On 15 august 1940, the allies invaded southern france, the invasion was called operation dragon.
In just two weeks, the americans and the free french forces were liberating southern france and returning to germany.
civilization is a single culture, a community shared by large groups of people living and working together.
The word civilization comes from civilis, which means civil, and is cognate with the latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city government, which in some sense describes the size of society.
Civilized culture refers to the transfer of knowledge across generations, to a lasting cultural imprint and to equitable distribution.
minority cultures often disappear without leaving valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as formal civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - the Congress being the sole body - under the Articles of Confederation.
The council had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or court, it often relied on the uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
nor did it have the power to revoke tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles require the unanimous consent of all the states before they can be ratified and the states have not properly taken over the central government, so their representatives are mostly left behind.

Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest is called Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often called an "archipel" in geographical terms because of the group of islands that Japan has
Taiwan began in the 15th century, when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the dutch east india company laid the foundation for a revolution in the grain management practices of the natives in southern taiwan, and employed chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the first sino-japanese war (1894-1895), the qing government signed the treaty of shimonoski, which ceded sovereignty over taiwan to japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
machu picchu consists of three main structures called the intuatana, the temple of the sun, and the three-glazed room.
most of the buildings in the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better understanding of how they first arrived.
By 1976, thirty percent of the machu picchu had been recovered and the restoration work is still ongoing.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its optical power has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest total number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) have this aspect ratio equal to or very close.
The third-party rule of the joke and laugh is a simple guide to creating flexibility while maintaining a certain level of perspective on the image.
The most effective place for the main case is to talk about one of the intersections of the lines that divide the image upwards and horizontally into three (see example).
the rich and powerful catholic church came under scrutiny during this period of european history.
for more than a thousand years, christianity united the european empire despite differences in language and culture.
his destructive power affects all from one generation to the next.
one of the basic tenets of christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's endowment fund is set aside for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money has led many to question whether its basic guiding beliefs are being fulfilled.
shortly after the battle, britain began to blockade the german navy.
Although this suspension violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries, the strategy has been effective in cutting off the necessary military and civilian supplies.
British bombed international bodies of water to prevent any ships from crossing wide stretches of water, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
the only answer to the tactic was that germany would have to fight an unlimited naval war.
In the 1920's, the antiwar and loneliness tendencies of many citizens and countries prevailed.

in 1884, tesla moved to the united states to accept a job with edison's company in new york city.
He entered the US with 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of thanks from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
ancient china has a unique way of representing different time periods, all the chinese rank or all the ruling families had a distinct dynasty.
And the division of the lands between each dynasty was a period of instability. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
during these times, a fierce battle was fought between many princes competing for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, with thousands fighting and dying as they struggled to sit on the highest throne of the Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from reality to popularity, nationalism and the fact that the country is not owned by the people but by a single ruler.
and the most ambitious and successful post-revolutionary professions were open to all male applicants.
The same is true for the army, because instead of ranking troops by class, they are now ranked by caliber.
the french revolution inspired the oppressed working class of many other countries to start their own revolts.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the ordinary life. To meditate, he would often visit the cave known as hirad, on mount nur (light).
The cave itself, which survived from its time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
resting on top of a mountain to the north, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is easy to find out if someone knows it exists, but never find it. once inside the cave, total isolation.
From the cave, you can see or hear only a tiny part of this world.
the great pyramid of giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The great pyramid, built by the egyptians in the third century bce, is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor the late pharaoh.
The giza plateau or giza necropolis, in egypt's valley of the dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the great sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and families.
The upper termination looks like a V and the lower termination looks like a stapler wire or a square that has lost its bottom.
Up means you must push the arrow slowly, starting at the tip, and down means you must start at the point of the bow (which is where your hand holds the arrow) and pull the arrow.

You can mark your own score with a lead, but the printed Boeing markings are for musical reasons and should be respected.
The shocked King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Jesse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of angry market women.
The king and queen are surrounded by a mob that shouts and threatens them, and they return to Paris.
The mobs forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of the chariot.
one of the party was presenting to the shocked queen the head of the royal guard who had been executed at versailles.
the imperialist united states paid the price of war to the people of the philippines.
The Philippines government agrees to pay airline charges and bond interest to the U.S. purchasing power through Wall Street banks.

The period of events is known as the High Middle Ages, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries in European history (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages precede the Early Middle Ages and are followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends in the year 1500 by agreement.
A strong sense of commitment to technology that involves a number of ideas in practice, from the technological-pressure or the need for technology to the idea that human destiny is derived from the basic logic associated with scientific laws and the emergence of technology.
Most definitions of technology determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a vastly wider path than cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts on the societies in which it is founded rather than on the social context".
For example, it can be said that motor vehicle forced leads to road development.
But a national road network for small cars is not economical, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
owning more cars also increases the risk of road accidents, leading to the development of new techniques to repair damaged parts.
Romanticism was a major part of the cultural commitment of writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schegel.
In the context of romanticism, it was better to draw geographical individuals and later cultures associated with geography and to make random rules that fit the social context.
Paris is the fashion capital of the modern world, while Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The reputation of being a center of luxury lasted from about 400 ad to 1100 ad.
in the twelfth century, the situation deteriorated as mainly christian warlords returned with gifts that were more valuable than those offered by the byzantine market, such as herbs and spices.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
at first, the robe had a profound influence on byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication routes, lifestyles in the West may be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe had begun to develop its own style of dress. One of the greatest developments of the war was the introduction of locks to lock clothes.
subsistence farming is when the farmer has a product that can only benefit him and his family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic, system of using seed deposits that are native to the ecosystem to increase yields by combining crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
historically, most farmers have been engaged in hand-to-mouth farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who may feel marginalized in social circles, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
The culture of the members may be different based on age, nationality, class, location, and/or gender.
the characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these.
members of a subculture often indicate their membership in a unique and symbolic writing style that includes fashion, practices, and slang.
One of the most common ways we use to explain the importance of social life is to see children who have grown up in bad circumstances, abuse, or suffering, not being taught to live with their caregivers.
Some children are shunned by others (often their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment is because the parents do not accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before abandoned children arrive or flee, they are severely abused or emotionally traumatized.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, some said to have lived alone in the forest.
When non-human animals are fully developed, wild animals display fully specialized animal-like characteristics (e.g. fear or indifference to humans).
While project-based learning should be made simple and interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support for individuals who are just beginning a new learning process, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Summaries can be both virtual and real, in other words, it is a way of summarizing, like a teacher who is a little person who is attaching a piece of paper to Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are contained within the software and are intended to question, analyze, and explain processes that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
children are placed in foster care for various reasons, from neglect, violence, and even theft.
No child should grow up in an environment that is careless, caring, and uneducating, but they will.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
foster care is supposed to provide all the necessary things that were missing in the previously occupied home.
The internet combines the features of openness and two-person communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet in terms of usability and satisfaction lead to additional dimensions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important drivers for Internet service (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "continuous interaction" were also identified as new motivational aspects when Egme and McCord (1998) analyzed the audience responses to websites.
Video recording has led to important breakthroughs in interpreting facial expressions, which last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is believed that one can determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting sub-clauses.
Oliver Sachs, in his essay, The President's Speech, points out how people who cannot understand speech because of brain injury can accurately assess honesty.
he mentioned that such abilities to recognize human behavior could also be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
twentieth century research shows that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and revealed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the pool of variation described.
The difference in the dispute of separation and reintegration with each generation between the two pools.
In savannah, it is difficult for human-like digestive systems to satisfy the amino acid requirements of plant food sources there.
Failure to do so also has serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources could be proteins in leaves and nuts, but these are difficult to digest unless they are cooked for mammals like us.
in contrast, animal foods (insects, mushrooms, eggs) are easily digestible and provide a high amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
all things considered, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors in the savannah were in some way overwhelmed by their protein problem, as chimpanzees do today.
Interruption is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep cycle and falling back to sleep after a short period (1060 minutes).
this can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without being completely awake.
If you see the clock being reset in your sleep, it can be placed across the room to get you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing a person to wake up for urination.
the inner peace of a person is inversely related to the amount of stress in a body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
everyone has access to knowledge. the only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
tibetan buddhism is based on buddhist teachings, but extends from mahayana and the path of love and indian yoga in many techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves Kundalini yoga, meditation and an all-encompassing romantic journey.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini power (consciousness) is activated through yoga postures, breathing movements, mantras, and visions.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods. Through the inspiration of various gods, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are moved, and the light of consciousness is created.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, forming a coalition between the USSR and the United States. By the end of the war, conflicts of order, process, and culture had led the countries to collapse.
two years before the war ended, the former allies had become enemies, and the cold war began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see action on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On september 17, 1939, the polish defense was broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize the roman army with the position of the roman army.
However, these plans were thwarted overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Anti-War Treaty, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
shipping is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods by sea.
The normal task of the navy is to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, and at the same time to disrupt your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One recent example worth mentioning is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to smuggle people and goods across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the german navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using u-boats.
if the allies had fallen, germany would have taken over britain, as it had taken over the rest of europe.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran, probably 10,000 years ago.
ancient cultures and tribes began to expect milk, hair, meat and skins to be easily supplied.
Often domestic goats are kept in herds that roam the mountains or other pastures, often as infants or as adult shepherds. These methods of breeding are still used today.
In the early 16th century waggonways were built in england.
although the chariots consisted only of parallel tracks, they pulled horses to achieve greater speed and allowed larger loads to be hauled than on the roads that were a little more difficult than the day.
to keep the tracks in place, the crusaders introduced early. gradually, however, it became clear that tracks with a metallic surface would be more effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the chariots.
finally, wooden tires were replaced by iron. in 1767, the first fully metallic tires were made.
The first known transport was by foot, with humans beginning to travel on foot, with the appearance of Homo erectus two million years ago.
The predecessor, the ostralopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Although bipedal evolution was found in the Australopithecus fossil from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be advocates to reduce future suffering in some way.
This is in many cases like symptomatic therapy. However, if we only want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
it is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems have been increasing due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of mankind.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was taken to the printer's office a few lines away.
all night long, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as dunlop broadcast discs.
The first public reading of the document was held on july 8 in the grounds of john nixon's freedom hall.
One was sent to george washington on july 6, and he read it to his troops in new york on july 9. a copy arrived in london on august 10.
The 25 known dunlop roads are the earliest surviving copies of the documented route. The original manuscript has not survived.
today, many fossil scientists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. we call them birds.
many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
but there is still much to learn about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-rex.
Today, most computers are based on binary data.
Binary numbers have only one or two places, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer language.
Intravenous toxicity is not immediately apparent. Symptoms such as nausea are not immediately detectable.
The best sign of internal toxicity may be the presence of an open medicine or toxic household chemicals.
If there are any specific first aid instructions for that particular poison, check the article.
the term ant is the common name used by entomologists for a group of insects.
the word comes from the ancient genus of ticks, which are highly adapted to live in close proximity to humans.
Both migratory-flies and bed bugs are refugees, adapted to live in their nests or in their native habitat.

people drive to work from small rural towns every morning and are passed by people who have left their workplaces.
In this dynamic transport fleet, everyone is somehow connected and supported by a transport system based on private cars.
science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has triggered the biosphere from the stable state that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, sometimes the same complaints are heard about water quality and the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems bring such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply not qualified? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers show behavior within a relatively consistent range, so traffic flows have some relative consistency and can be represented mathematically roughly.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help to plan, design and operate road facilities.
souls were the first animals to fly. their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies easily and to find food and mates efficiently.

Generally speaking, when managers start managing their former colleagues, two traits can come into play: one is to try to remain a co-founder (or one).
This type of supervisor has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, making performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end, one person changes everything the group has been doing and turns to an unknown individual who feels they have to do it themselves.
in any case, the leader ultimately takes responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
this behavior often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are associated with the same levels of advancement as conventional groups, but have subtle differences.
virtual group members serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
