Welsh MPs are worried they'll be mistaken for Muppets
Some MPs have expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern arose in relation to plans to change the name of the Welsh Assembly.
Members across the political spectrum are worried that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his party was worried it would "come to resemble the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "dumb" and the word "pwp" means "excess".
A Plaid MP said the party as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his own faction was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "muppets".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill to enact the name change, said: "The final decision on any name by which the MPs will be called will of course be a matter for the MPs themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the widely accepted proposals for the name of the parliament as the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of MPs, the Commission has favoured the designation 'Member of the Welsh Parliament' or WMP, but the MWP choice has been the one that has received the most support in the public consultation.
MPs are obviously proposing alternatives, but trying to reach a consensus may be a difficult matter for Parliament Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table the name change bill within the next few weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include other changes to the way the Parliament operates, including rules on dismissal from office of the MP and the design of the committee system.
MEPs will decide on the issue of their names in the final vote during the debate on the legislation.
The citizens of Macedonia go to the polls for the referendum on the country's name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that its northern neighbor's name conceals territorial ambitions and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO accession requests.
Giorgi Ivanov, president of Macedonia, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would not consider the vote.
However, the referendum's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that change is simply the price they must pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have gone silent as churches in Harlem disappear.
"The older people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is neither".
He said he understood why the bars disappeared.
"The world is socializing differently today", he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood lounge where people hang out regularly".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the authorities hope "and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
The churches, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who will not be willing to help the remaining places of worship in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when all these churches will be closed down completely, because it is unlikely that all these people who will move into these apartments will become members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation withdrew in the 1930's.
A black congregation nearby took over the building.
The St. Martin's building was taken over by a black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted the stores on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners undertook the rebuilding and ordered the carriage.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July described it somewhat differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany Inn of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first choir in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger choir at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What's been going on in the last few months at St. Martin's is a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the lay leaders of the church while others by the diocese.
The commissioners - the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders - sent the diocese a letter in July about their concerns that the diocese "would seek to shift costs" to the board of commissioners, despite the fact that it had no involvement in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark attack on 13-year-old lobster diver in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the first day of lobster season, authorities say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was scuba diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child's cries for help and approached rowing with a team to pull it out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just cries of excitement because he caught lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
His entire clavicle was open", remarked Hamel when he arrived at the boy's location.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!'" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Lifeboat rescuer Larry Giles told the press that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was not considered to be a threatened species.
Giles added that the victim has severe injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Bis in Casamoblas to Swamis in Encinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are putting pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by putting cosmetics shelves on par with department stores, staffed by dedicated staff.
As part of the UK cosmetics market's significant rise to £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and home goods are falling, the largest cosmetics shelves will be put on trial in 11 stores across the country and will be extended to more stores if the venture is successful.
The investment in cosmetics comes as supermarkets look to replace shelf space once occupied by TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it will double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including companies like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines will also be given more space with company-logo shelves, similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is re-launching its own boutique makeup line so that most products are vegan - something increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to sell its products in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other in Shelley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the trend of buying small amounts of food daily in local mini-markets means that supermarkets will have to make greater efforts to get people to visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlet stores will increasingly resemble department stores as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services.
Sainsbury's has put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, while also introducing some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which has supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to distribute profits from the chain's pharmacy stores to the chain's supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play its own role in the scheme, adding an expanded range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of companies is designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a potential destination for cosmetics that challenge the traditional way of shopping".
Peter Jones: angry after Holly Willoughby walked out of the £11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby walked away from an £11 million deal with her lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly clothing and accessories.
Their business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Company.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced on Instagram her decision to step down.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by stepping down from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute in order to focus on her huge new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became enraged when the television golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - she would no longer have enough time to devote to clothing and accessories company Truly.
The company has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and appears to have doubled Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his country homes.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly Willoughby's top priorities.
It was about her long-term future, her source of income for decades to come.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There's a warehouse full of products at headquarters in Marlow ready to go for sale".
Experts estimate that the departure of the host of "This Morning", one of Britain's most commercially successful celebrities, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares, as well as further delay in her presentation.
And that could spell the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained a close friendship with Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend his vacations together, and Jones retains a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the face of M&S campaigns and replace Ed McPartlin as host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night, "We would not like to comment on his professional affairs".
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for a comment that some would consider unfitting for a president, as well as his very positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in a TV presenter-like tone.
"I have not conceded anything".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Rai Yong-ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "corresponding response" from the US after North Korea's early disarmament.
He said the US was not prepared to accept the US's demands for a ceasefire.
Trump kept a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have built this wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim bore positive fruit - ending missile tests, freeing hostages, and returning the remaining American troops home.
While he maintained his unusual stance in statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'presidential' look, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd have only 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their wake
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lompoc, for example, it was announced that foreign NGOs would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lompoc was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite difficult", said Ms. Shubung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether the foreign staff will be able to work on site.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the earthquakes that frequently hit Indonesia, the country remains woefully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, the same is not true of other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning in Palo, even after a warning, may have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, moving between Indonesia's many islands is difficult.
Natural disasters make administrative care even more difficult.
A floating hospital that was stationed in Lompoc to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's disorganized infrastructure and generously allocated money to build roads and railways.
However, a lack of funding is plaguing Mr Joko's administration ahead of his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fight in the streets, using knives, bows and arrows, as well as other handmade weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a pass by Serdhan Sakiri about 27 yards away from Chelsea's goal with his team down 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left and kicked it into the back of the net.
His effort was driven too high off the big area and ended up right up in the nets.
The ball finally fell on Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to fend it off and hit the net.
"I was trying to take this position, to get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to buy as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kade approach, I made a direct substitution, I didn't think much about it and I made the shot".
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead at half-time after a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue forward gave a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before he made a foul shot near the center of the field and ran to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a deep pass, leading Azar into the big area.
Azar ran ahead of the defender and completed the run by sending the ball into the back of the net with a left-handed shot in front of Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The tragic death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia stands at 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia stands at 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit the area on Friday and created waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Puruo Nugroho said in a press conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old suspect in the stabbing death of a woman.
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked the people who saw or heard anything to report it to the police .
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the neighbouring area around John Street and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who believe they may know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police say they are in the process of notifying the next of kin.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews, attempting to return to his apartment was informed by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been advised that it may be hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene at this time.
A woman came onstage in tears.
He kept saying, "It's horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the police tape and one outside.
Officers were standing outside the strip and watching the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers hotline on 0800 555 111 anonymously for case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest monument to be hit by the "rewrite history" controversy
His ostracism would be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious works by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr Crick's proposal "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the present discussion about the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would not be targeted.
The iconography of England's civil wars was neither dictated nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The remarkable portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hammock Thornycroft is a hallmark of his image in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure many believe deserves tribute.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressures, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate assumption is a matter of open historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable".
Pig-killer fatally wounds Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose only name was revealed as "Wuan", was found with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a pig farm in the Liuangshui market in Guizhou province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farm worker prepares to give vaccines to pigs on May 30, 2005 in Jining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door to a neighboring pigsty open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
The coroner's examination confirmed that the pig, weighing 227 kilos, had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", said the cousin, known by his surname "Wu", according to the evening news report of Guiyang.
Security camera footage shows Wang entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wan or his cousin.
A market official told the evening news that the pig has been put in a cage to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wang's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig threw a Welsh farmer onto his tractor until the farmer's wife scared the animal away.
After an incident in which an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "injection".
"They're just in a playful mood.
They're little, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them the proper respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are set to bring extensive rainfall to the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa's winds reached 85 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching low-pressure area will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 centimeters will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possibly desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will result in rainfall rates approaching 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of two to three inches is expected in places in the Southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Floods are likely with rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended that you avoid any movement on foot in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers and storms will cause locally strong winds and sandstorms.
The low-pressure area will create some locally heavy rainfall in locations along the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is possible, which can cause small debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical storms will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the effects widen late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October will see some sharp temperature changes across the U.S. as temperatures in the Arctic drop, but in the tropics remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very sharp temperature changes at close range.
A typical example of the sharp temperature differences between the central US was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and will spread again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., October is expected to start with high temperatures of 27 °C from the Eastern Plains to parts of the Southeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 90 degrees on Tuesday, about five degrees above average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a good chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million viewers watched the stunning testimony of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blaze Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with television networks interrupting the regular programming to overturn a last-minute deal on Friday: an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that at a party when they were high school students, Kavanaugh attacked her while drunk and tried to strip her.
Kavanaugh, in a powerful statement, said he was 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, more than 20.4 million viewers were likely to watch the hearing on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately made available to other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While Nielsen also usually has difficulty in calculating the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office premises.
To see this TV in its proper dimensions, it's an audience the size of a football playoff game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose reporters strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead by an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
They were followed by CBS at 3.1 million, NBC at 2.94 million, MSNBC at 2.89 million, and CNN at 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake has emerged as the leading man in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican said he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning captured protesters disapprove of him as he tried to get into the elevator for a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
He stood staring downward for several minutes as he was being disapproved of live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She said, "You have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were live-streaming a few hours later, the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote on advancing Kavanaugh's candidacy to the full Senate floor for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, something the Democratic minority has requested.
Flake was partly convinced after discussions with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Koons and a few other senators afterwards, Flake ruled.
Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not get the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has requested an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on Sept. 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the paper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is sharply critical of the Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal to collect tariffs between Britain and the EU was "totally absurd".
Police have arrested suspect Dayton Simpson in the murder of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and is being held in custody on a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have a video of Sims's fight with Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Officers located the glasses at the crime scene and said they found traces of Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, which is working with CBS.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to fatally wounding Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report from the East Baton Rouge medical examiner released Friday, cause of death is gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department has placed at the disposal of the Louisiana State Police a task force, the police crime lab, the Southern University police force and the local citizens to assist in the investigation of the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joey Aleva thanked local law enforcement for their "credible investigation and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-9 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wade's death.
"We are always worried about incidents like this", said Wade.
Emissions of volcanic ash in Mexico City
Volcanic ash emissions from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican residents on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after activity at the crater peaked, with 183 gas and ash emissions recorded in a 24-hour period.
The Centre was monitoring various signs and small earthquakes.
Images on social media show car windshields covered in thin layers of ash in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with law enforcement units as thousands took part in demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote to secede that sparked a polarization.
A group of masked pro-independence protesters, held by law enforcement units, threw eggs and paint in the dust, creating dark dust clouds on the roads usually flooded with tourists.
Clashes also took place later in the day with police using their clubs to quell the fights.
For hours, pro-independence groups in Catalonia chanted "We do not forgive, we do not forget" as pro-unity protesters chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although turnout was low with those opposed to independence boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to disrupt voting at polling stations in the region where violent clashes broke out.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held but had to take a different turn.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the pro-independence protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
"Last year was one of our most glorious.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant", he said.
Despite a crucial but limited victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders either self-exiled or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Pouts, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded the pro-police protests on his cell phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is escalating", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed last year, announced his candidacy for next year's European elections.
"My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the oppression we have received from the Spanish Government", he said.
London: man arrested after car crash at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash at a Londonterry residence.
The incident took place in Bolinegard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Flemings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a drive-by shooting at some point.
Menga's shot gave Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the win
Livingston's transfer surprised the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Group.
Dolly Menga's shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side changed levels with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains unbeaten away from home in the championship this season and will face the Harts, who have an eight-point lead, next Sunday.
Before this game, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, continues its unbeaten run in six games in its division, with head coach Holt still undefeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing chances to the visitors.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before he scored, with his directness putting the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and nearly got there just before the end, but Alan Lithgow thwarted his attempt by sliding Craig Halkett's head away from the end.
The pitchers willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could push the visitors into free throws and corners.
And that's how the big goal came.
The Rangers were unable to block a free kick and Livingston opened the scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to send the ball to Menga, who caught the pass and scored from the center of the field.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession but found the quarterback's defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no difficulty.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos deflected the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was blown back by Rangers goalie Alan McGregor's feet and Lithgow's pass went out in another Livingstone free kick.
There were many vertical passes in the Livingston area and they were repeatedly denied, while two penalties were requested - after Halkett claimed the ball against substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand - which were denied.
"Excellent game" by Livingstone - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Makaron Arena
Spectacular performances and results for Livingston.
All of them, without exception, were outstanding, exceeding expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their playing style and personality have changed little since their return to top form, but the credit should also go to Holt for the boost he gave the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, recruiting a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Worrell on alert throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration.
As good as they've been in the past under Gerard's guidance, they didn't meet those standards.
Their last game was flawed - they only managed to pass the home defense once and that's a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
The European Union has also been a key player in the fight against terrorism.
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29) at the meeting of the heads of state of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had broken up over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police have ruled out the 25,000-strong crowd in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have managed to get close enough to see their president up close.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them of Kurdish origin - also turned out, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The division of the protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor who is treated by some Turk-Germans as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Motorcycle accident in Dettort: cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detford, in the southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and abandoned a cyclist, who died on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities were making efforts to identify the man and notify his immediate family.
Roads have been closed and bus routes diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in clashes
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out at the maximum security men's prison, according to the prison administration.
Riots broke out at Her Majesty's Long Lardin Prison in Worcestershire at around 0930 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been recruited to deal with the riots, which involve eight prisoners and which took place in a ward.
The officers were hospitalized with minor facial injuries during the fighting.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel have taken over the incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may face a longer sentence".
Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the prison administration was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
In October last year, the prison's re-order units were called in to suppress serious incidents that erupted during which staff members were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep across the southwestern portions of the desert, bringing flooding in their path.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late Monday in heavy rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in tropical storm or low barometric status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border".
The latest models from the US National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with individual showers of up to 6 inches on the Mongolian Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwest States, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, 1 to 2 inches of precipitation is likely, with the possibility of individual total rainfall volumes up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk of flooding, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the area is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwest States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought", weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the storm, on Sunday morning Rosa will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore weaken.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall is likely in parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, possibly reaching up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. states", said the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerously heavy floods and mudslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excellent Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police are calling for anyone who may have videotaped the incident on their cell phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump told a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "lived the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically and with apparent emotion denying Christine Blaze Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before a jury about her claims.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding public service record", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a passing reference to Kavanaugh's candidacy while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but in fact it is as if I am", he said.
"THIS is why I travel all over supporting great candidates".
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total death toll is expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them washed away by giant waves that swept the coast, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when 20-foot-high waves hit the land at dusk, dragging many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so they were hit by it", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster response agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it washed away cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled through the ocean at speeds of 500 miles per hour before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster response agency show many damaged buildings and shops, bridges that have twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The tremors were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He reported that piles of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communication systems are "completely paralyzed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and it could get worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palo, even though officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building screaming in panic trying to warn people down the street of the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, washing away homes and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also cut communications in the wider area of Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending transport planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced are still in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened only to help with relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Dongala managed to reach the town of Palu safely, where workers took refuge in shelters set up in the front yard of their office, they passed through destruction tents along the way, Mr. Dosemba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some aid groups have taken on the sad task of starting the process of relieving the victims, some complain that foreign, highly experienced aid workers have not been allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, the flow of financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of an accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Auliya Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it's a national disaster, we can ask for international assistance, but there's no decision yet".
As the second day in Palous after Friday's earthquake and tsunami passes, friends and family of those still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that makes the story of these natural disasters less bleak.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national slope skating team, had trained two of the missing skater for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madai, were his students.
"As a veteran of the sport of slope skating, I have my own emotional load", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the slope skydiving community, he started sending desperate WhatsApp messages to his opponents in Palo who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the sign next to his messages was a gray "n" symbol, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while refueling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was loading an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more cash, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running after the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department by calling 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has long listened to the affectionate Ye and used that moniker as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album titled Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", as the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West has stated in the past that the word has religious significance to him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning 'you,'" West said earlier this year in a discussion about the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, we are us.
My name changes from Kane, which means "the one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused self, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of several famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Cobbs is known by various names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, ZE-ZI, is also comfortable using his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
The president-elect of Mexico vows not to use the military against civilians .
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student crackdown.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on AI research, says investor and AI professional Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes in addition to announcements from various parts of the US government on AI, as the US as a whole does not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan to become the world's number one country in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are aiming to make the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence", Li said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough taking place in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the best American player Othello, while later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized the importance of previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would be held to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that gets the best academics, it's the companies", he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university officials to work on AI issues in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to holders of a PhD in artificial intelligence", he said.
The State Council of China issued a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies respectively give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will include partners from the business and academic worlds, and the White House announced the formation of an AI Select Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation now invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in months on U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
The citizens of Macedonia hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia took part in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would overturn a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's bid for European Union and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether turnout will reach the required 50 percent for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that the youth of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because then our lives will all be safer", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several members of Parliament have said they will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it final.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when it gave the current 66 percent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorika and son Dusko voted in the referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union in the city of Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov sets up a small tent and sets up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as second-class partners", Kavardakov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said that a positive result would be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, the referendum would have a turnout of 30 to 43 percent, which is below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling formed Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed his ability to score easily in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the period.
He passed three Brighton defenders before he spilled into the open.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green players.
He dribbled past one defender, then evaded several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward made his first move into the area by returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the nets.
"Aguero is having some problems with his legs", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he'd play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment".
However, it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's area at this point.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Chanet.
Chanel kept possession of the ball and guided Sterling to the back of the post.
The blue forward kicked the ball into the net just before he went out.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Serger wants to beat the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the ever-competitive Serger hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still an impact for the Rockies in the playoffs, as they lead the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in the National League West.
The Rockies have advanced to the playoffs with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock in first place in their division.
"Even though we have nothing to win, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game probably of the highest level I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight a race like that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but they're reportedly inclined to let Serger pitch.
Serger, making his 34th start, made practice pitches Thursday and will play Sunday, which is normally his day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is giving a speech in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his chosen Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am, and for that reason I travel everywhere to support exceptional candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this lousy, lousy radical Democratic group, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to exterminate to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have taken on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean, miserable and liars".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by name to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, a reference that was met with strong public disapproval.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you uncover the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for an answer. That was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad faction.
He's not tolerant of people expressing their opinions.
I was not at all surprised that Momentum activists in my local group voted to impeach me.
I am the last in a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, precisely because we speak our mind.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion to dismiss was criticized for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, paradoxically, on issues similar to those on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone participating".
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday nights have been just like this.
Unfortunately, today, that is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a 'more compassionate, more compassionate' policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever really begun to materialize.
It is increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously considered that we had similar political views began to expect me to make a 180 degree turn and adopt views that I would never agree with, whether they were about national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I actually said, I heard a roar on social media, where people were calling for my dismissal, denying the policies of the Centre and telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And this didn't just happen to me.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments made to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but never back down.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad party and that with every proposal for censure or change in the selection rules, the party's boundaries are narrowing.
I've been advised a lot in the last two years not to stand up, not to talk too much and that "everything will be fine".
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, still a student, because of the neglect of the Thatcher government that led to the failure of my entire class, my aim has been to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, and I didn't hide my politics in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way as to my political views and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the impeachment motion on Friday, all I have to say is that as the country faces a Brexit that will hit our households, businesses and public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, my only message is not to the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political expediency will deter me from acting as I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
The undefeated Air rises to the top .
Two late goals may have somewhat skewed the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this highly entertaining match today in the Tened Championship.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was her superior defense, as well as her best exploitation of opportunities, that tipped the scales in favor of the home team, and coach Peter Murcie had every reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I should be happy", he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute goal from a conversion by Fraser Climate brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card to Scot Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott scored a goal without conversion.
Climate extended Ayr's lead with a penalty before scoring, just in the half, a conversion goal, leading Ayr into the dressing room with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Baggott's conversion, cut the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Roaring Noth, who was carried off by a stretcher, and, after the restart, Ayr further increased the gap with a goal from Stafford McDowall, with a conversion by Climate.
The secondary captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the numerical advantage with a goal from Bruce Colvin without a conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The fielders recovered, however, and when Strouan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climate without the ball from the penalty line, McPherson scored on the back of the attack launched by Ayr.
Climate made a conversion, as he has done almost since the restart, after first Kylie Rowe collected a kick from David Armstrong and sent out the extreme Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the wicket.
Still Game star starts a new career in the food business
Still Game star Ford Kearnan looks set to make the jump to the restaurant business after it was revealed he's been named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars in with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hambfil.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth season will be the show's last, and it seems that Kearnan is planning his life after Geigland.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kearnan wants to tackle the "thriving food industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Blockaded Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling the fully equipped naval headquarters at La Paz.
Blue flags are flying in public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are inscribed with the slogan: "The sea is rightfully ours.
It is our duty to take her back".
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline Chile conquered after a bloody conflict over natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the yearning of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have been raised today more than ever in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court's decision on October 1 after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it is looking forward to the outcome with a positive eye", said Roberto Calzantila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim to force Chile, after decades of unstable talks, to negotiate for Bolivia a sovereign sea access.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is in a contentious battle for re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to give away thousands of acres of land and has made clear it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court's decision is due to be issued just six months after the final arguments were presented suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of further advancing Bolivia's goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current Bolivian government has usurped the issue of access to the sea", Zarate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric has exhausted any remaining goodwill in Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzantila also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular leaders, uses the issue of access to the sea as a political leverage.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to move on from the past".
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made at a summit in Singapore by the leaders of the two countries.
Ri made the comments as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the notion that continued sanctions and the US refusal to declare an end to the Korean War will eventually force the North to "kneel" is a summer nightmare.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration unless Pyongyang first makes significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is seriously considering giving up an arsenal that the country views as likely to be the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to grow your hat collection or avoid the sun altogether, then stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown showcased on the catwalk a series of bizarre oversized hats for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection that stole the show at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and their designers sent their stunning creations to the catwalk.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was an oversized beige hat decorated with a wide feathered boar that completely covered the models' heads.
Among other oversized accessories were watermelons decorated with gems, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a series of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than to haute couture fashion.
One creation was full of diving gear with a respirator and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to embrace this style of fashion with huge accessories, you're in luck.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after "La Bomba", the oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized, oversized,
The popular brand that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media has also sent another big creation onto the catwalk, a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wearing it in her swimsuit.
The dark orange shelf bag, decorated with shelf crowns and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus's La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and big beach bags in stores next summer, as the designer made such a big impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with yet another string of outstanding test scores, which were only further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to pupils and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher levels of education, the careers they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, then what you say goes into their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes to his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on recent results of this year's exams, we find that languages are at the top of the performance charts, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved A grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also had A grades.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as an elective subject, are considered as important as subjects related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey revealed that, as to the reasons employers had difficulty filling job vacancies, a rate of 17 percent was related to a lack of language skills.
The need to acquire language skills is therefore becoming increasingly urgent in order to prepare young people for their future professional careers.
As more future job opportunities require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future because of this skill that you can use throughout your life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically that multilingual person will have an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
That is why investing in language learning today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be some languages to choose from in independent schools, which have specialised language teachers.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It cannot be denied that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of a country, and this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered truly 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for Scotland's young people.
They have to.
John Edward is a director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans eager to see LeBron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell tweeted that James will likely play a few minutes.
After practice a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need prep matches at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies starting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned rallies for Trump next week, which include tours of friendly neighboring states like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his Supreme Court nomination pending, Trump is seeking to bolster popular support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to make reference to this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been held in a tense atmosphere over sexual misconduct allegations, with a Senate confirmation vote put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
However, the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing a contested election in November gain momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies next week are aimed at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Congressional oversight is so critical to his agenda that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as we move into the busy campaign period", a Trump campaign spokesman, who wished to remain anonymous, told Reuters.
The rally scheduled for tonight at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media coverage", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is down in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come and try to give him a push to the polls", said Simon Hender, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has the guts to fight back and keep the hope alive as they head into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon's foursome might be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging pendulum is a completely fabricated sporting idea, yet players believe it deeply, especially in these matches.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They were up six degrees and now they're up four, so we've probably got a little bit of momentum", Jordan Spith said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of having a four-point lead and 12 points remaining in the game.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air in their sails" and have much to cheer them on, like the Spith and Justin Thomas duo playing together all day and each scoring three points out of four.
Spithe was lethal from the tee to the green and setting an example.
The cheers grew louder as he continued his lap, scoring a crucial hit to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The game-winning shot on the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations that show his belief that the American team is not out.
"You have to look deep inside yourself and worry about your own game", said Spith.
It's what every player has left behind.
18 holes to make history.
The only players with more points than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but adorable twin has done four out of four and seems to be doing nothing wrong.
The "Mollywood" was the only twin that did not hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy spectators, seals the fact that it is the players who should win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a potential European win as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory is still premature.
Daddy Watson and Webb Simpson put glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they stuck the Spaniard and the Swede so deep into a hole they couldn't get out of it.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourball and foursome are such exciting games to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome game also showed that the US team has the guts, despite some doubts.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after taking a 10-6 lead in Saturday's fourball and foursome against the United States.
The inspired twin of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari has raced to two victories over a challenger Tiger Woods and has managed to take the lead in Le Golf National by four points so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the flawed American side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. was more resistant to foursomes, winning two games, but could not make up the difference.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight, while along with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", after a shocking weekend he is only the second pair to win four in the first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed at fourball, they joined forces to defeat a tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Desampo with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who has been dragged into Saturday's two games, has shown occasional bursts of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven innings.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning's fourball, returned to teammate Henrik Stenson for the foursome with 2&1 defeats to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, taking first and third place in the world rankings.
Not all went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set the American record by two points on Saturday.
They won a hard 2&1 over Spain's John Ram and Ian Poulter in the fourball and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing both holes in the opening round.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team been able to bounce back from a four-point loss in singles, although because he is the trophy holder, Furyk needs to draw to retain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it won't disarm unilaterally without confidence-building measures.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepen distrust of the United States and that his country will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and ballistic tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we are not seeing any response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to unilaterally initiate our disarmament".
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded as it progresses in the process, his statement was significant in that it did not completely rule out unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint communiqué of Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between an acting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first "surrender" its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing of tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on denuclearization first and increases pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve its goal by blackmailing, obstructing even the declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust".
Ri made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader pointed out at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the partner on the issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean ballistic missiles was inevitable because "Bad President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving forward with disarmament measures, but said more still needed to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and uninterruptedly until full, final and confirmed denuclearisation is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to neutralize funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, only to be denounced by North Korea a few hours later for having "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to de-icer a missile facility and also a nuclear complex, if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump promised Singapore and promoted normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a class on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is urging all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing mass culture of overnight study with heavy caffeine consumption.
One academic discovered that students at the world's number one university often do not know basic things, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a resident physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the class after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"Finally, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I only learning about this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to include the course when it was found that students were significantly sleep deprived during the week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a student dormitory where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't immediately change student behavior.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke", added Professor Chesler.
The culture of boasting about studying all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough, good-quality sleep should be students' "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation state, resulting in a persistent feeling of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the lecture was an eye opener and inspired him to push for a lecture across campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to take a similar program before they start their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler recommended that students set a bedtime warning and an alarm clock for waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Menga scores for Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another heartbreaking home defeat as Dolly Menga's shot led Steven Gerrard's uncoordinated side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking to score their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstown, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving the team eight points behind first-placed Ladbrokes side Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes into the half and the Rangers' breathless roster seemed unable to respond.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston are up to third, just one goal behind Hibernian in the lead.
And the Rangers may be in for more trouble as Superintendent Callum Spence was admitted to emergency medical for a head injury caused by an object thrown from the bleachers.
Gerard made eight changes to the squad and defeated Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Levi 11 composition that got a grade from Harts last week and would have been happy with how this well-oiled machine of his was able to stifle any effort from the opponents.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute when Menga's first long pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the center missed the ball.
A deep free throw by Keegan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defenceman Alan Lithgow could only move the ball away from the post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith for the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have won a penalty in the 15th minute as he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers had only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not at all concerned about Lasana Coulibaly's head and Ovi Edgarian's subdued shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the race Livy was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved the win for the effort alone.
Once again, the Rangers failed to address Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and found Menga who just completed the attempt.
Gerard made changes in the half to take out Coulibaly and put in Ryan Kent, and the change worked almost immediately as the extreme passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to lure the guests into the style of play she knows and enjoys, with Lithgow and Halkett taking away one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have increased the gap towards the end, but McGregor faced straight Jacobs, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt from the corner.
Rangers' alternate, Glenn Middleton, had another penalty kick towards the end as he collided with Jacobs, but again Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
A page from the Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and BUT... the day in Germany that the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, which eventually led to the device now known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science ever since, the Geiger counter has crossed over into the pop culture realm, as in the 1950 movie titled Bells of Coronado, starring the amazing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive metals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of atoms caused by radiation in the metal elements".
Evans: "Look, he's acting crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues its work.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to "see" troubled cells
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to "see" and kill problem cells
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common in various cancers and then be injected back into them.
A vaccine being tested shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize faulty cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory to "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzowski, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands".
As Professor Berzowski explained, the HER2 protein "is the driving force behind the development of several cancers", such as breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers.
A similar approach, in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then "taught" how to target cancer cells, has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended Trump by wearing a hat with the slogan MAGA after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was dismissed from the studio during a Saturday Night Live appearance after a one-on-one interview in which he praised US President Donald Trump and stated that he would run for re-election in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again, he gave a recital of anti-Democratic tantrums and reiterated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times I talk to a white guy and he says, 'What do you like about Trump?
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon, with the Hollywood star satirizing Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blazy Ford's allegations of sexual assault.
Although not aired, the video of West's delusion was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this post.
West also complained to the audience that he was not treated well backstage because of his hat.
"I got bowled backstage.
They said, "Don't go out in a hat".
They bowled me!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what's going on with me? I'm going to wear the Superman cape, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Try the love".
His comments were dismissed at least twice by the audience and SNL staffers seemed to be in a bit of a pickle, Variety reported, with one person telling the magazine: "There was a deathly silence throughout the studio".
West was called in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days earlier.
West confused a lot of people when he sang "I Love It" dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU for standing up to the crowd".
However, the show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "himself and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe embraces and speaks an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Didi.
Rapper Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course music legend Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for the stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after attacking a man with a knife in an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhacamore, according to the police.
The accused is due to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is criticizing toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow on the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the hero bunch, saying that such screen roles send the message to young boys that they must be tough to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said "something is wrong" and wondered how to combat the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he has a "strong opinion" on the matter.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much. Where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we teaching men as they grow up about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity because of the masculine characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must display such behavior to be men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How can we change this?
Clearly, something is wrong with our young people".
In the interview, she also admitted that she does not plan to star in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel after the series ends next summer, saying "no more fighting and no more horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever done on Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so in a way she gave me my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Hegret, the love repellent of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit, on the Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 820,000 people are affected, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of cases, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been almost zero, as Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a senior official leaked data on Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied claims that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles claimed the allegations were made by "far-right" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more horrible lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senators Lindsay Graham and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and appears to have been posted by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill environment during a Senate committee hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and published the details of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely untrue and a blatant lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely untrue and a blatant lie".
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is filled with anger", wrote Fleischer.
"That shows he doesn't have the guts to be a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
It must not be impudent.
He must not question the motives of his accuser.
He must be calm and peaceful".
Fletcher appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee seeking to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement of these false allegations".
"We will do everything to find those responsible", he continued, "and hold them accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Back - a subtle spy film starring Rowan Atkinson
It's now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new British-themed film, and that seems to be true in this revival of the action-comedy franchise starring Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English: The Return.
Can this humorous self-satire about how obviously screwed we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with curly eyes was able to renew his license to make a mess of it a second time.
This is of course the steamy secret agent who while pretending to have the glitz and manners of a secret agent, brings a little bit of Clouseau, with a dose of "Mr. Bean" and something of the type that played a single note to the theme music of the film Paths of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's most forgotten television commercials, wreaking havoc in his passing.
There's a good moment or two in this last JE movie.
I liked when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, the humor is rather understated and oddly overblown, especially at a time when "serious" film franchises like 007 and Danger Mission now include quite a few comedic elements.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's crazy stunts are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's silent film sketches of the character of Bean.
The eternal central issue is that Britain has a serious problem.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret online spy network, exposing the identities of every British agent on assignment, much to the chagrin of the on-duty agent played by Kevin Elton in an unfortunately small role for his range.
It's the last straw for a pompous and ambitious prime minister on the brink of collapse due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn't help her much.
Intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she should bring back someone unarmed.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a principal at some high-end school, but gives informal classes for secret agents: here are some nice scenes as English offers a spy academy like One School Too Rock.
Inglis returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former and passionate partner Buff, again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not fully utilized.
So Batman and Robin from the Secret Service's cover-up of His Majesty's return to action, meeting the beautiful and fateful Ofelia Bulatova played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously fascinated by the gifted tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's technological woes: the menacing Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
Inglis and Buff begin the odyssey of their farce: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glitzy French restaurant, cause chaos as they attempt to board Volta's luxury yacht illegally, and Inglis causes anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as cute and noisy as it is, it still reminds me a little of children's television.
It's the mediocre stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films I wonder: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really does excel with his talent?
Labour denies that they are considering a plan to make British people work four days but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to consider a radical plan to make the British work four days a week, but get paid for five days' work.
The party is reportedly seeking corporate bosses to funnel the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend without a pay cut.
Sources say the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the tables on workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy change is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is an ambition that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for industry".
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not party policy and is not under consideration by the party".
Shadow Cabinet Secretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell has said he is determined to reclaim power from "faceless directors" and "profit-seekers" in utilities.
The shadow government secretary's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back, as a potential Labour government could make "holds" on suspected irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to set up mutual funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are speaking on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could sift through anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy came out more forthright than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said that on my way to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly, "What did you do?"
He was firm, determined, decisive".
However, Graham's vote doesn't look like it's going to change.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it's gonna take some explosive accusation to change my mind", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
"And whoever he has named, he cannot confirm.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it helped reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and celebrity stars, but an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
For the seventh year running, tens of thousands are expected to flock to Central Park's Great Lawn as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those actively fighting against it.
To secure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), participants had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as registering as a volunteer, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or finding other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called "click activism", where someone feels they are really making a difference by signing an e-petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen group reports that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, promoting a range of different causes.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least USD 10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and implementers who have made a commitment to "help children reach their full potential", pledging to give Rwanda $35 million to eradicate malnutrition, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracy Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition, which targets 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to the question "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?" included in the website's FAQ,
One member of the Global Citizen community responded: "The road ahead will be long and hard, and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because united we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will be performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
The US Navy can use the blockade to block Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington may turn to its Navy "if necessary" to block the deployment of Russian energy in markets including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reasons they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they do in eastern and southern Europe", he said, according to reports.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to counter Russian activity.
"The United States has the ability, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that Russian energy is not put on the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that has been described as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the utilization and replacement of fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "pony that knows only one trick" as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration has taken on the mission of boosting exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, will make Berlin "captive" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of $11 billion, which is to double the existing capacity of the pipelines to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a leverage and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which stressed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to distance itself from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting at Holyoke, Massachusetts' city hall, Warren confirmed she was looking into the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider a run for president".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren didn't chew on her words about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote".
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
58% of "potential" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The poll showed more support for a possible candidacy than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other popular names from Democrats discussed in connection with a possible 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll have a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to PTSD at the Donald Trump rally.
Truck Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"With what my son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families living with the effects of PTSD and the trauma our soldiers carry home", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to go off", and said of her son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, come back tougher, come back wondering if there's any respect for what the soldiers, the airmen and every other member of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed an amicus brief Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the suit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang-member sons" abused her, however, US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was being held in Texas.
Lawyers for the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries with severe problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to allow undocumented migrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Under federal law, all asylum claims must be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim. Such an impediment violates this principle", the amicus curiae brief stated.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, making the claim that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "form a necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims trying to escape domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 statement on the policy.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles despite a struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very intense", said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her feverish baby at an evacuation center set up in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute more bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce".
Some residents attempted to return to their destroyed homes and gather their belongings from the water, trying to salvage what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were unable to meet the needs.
Some injured, such as Dewey Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, remained outside the Palo Alto Army Hospital, where first aid was being given in the countryside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt the violent earthquake rattle the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the rubble of the wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese state-run newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper touting mutual trade benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid ad in China Daily that appeared in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although foreign governments are not prohibited from advertising to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war and have imposed various tariffs on imports from each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at hurting exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit America's workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is indulging in this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"In an effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's precious tradition of free speech and free press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the booths in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and no true representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economic course, given that the media are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has refused the offer to publish" his article, though he did not disclose which one.
Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of the midterm elections because of the Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn.
As many leading Republicans continue to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn there will be a backlash, particularly from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Feelings on this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have stated that they would like to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be fixed", Grant Reyer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill of an article published on Saturday.
Reyer doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute move to ask for an FBI investigation will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget tomorrow, and they are certainly not going to forget in November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national press secretary for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the Senate aisle as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee gave the green light for Kavanaugh's nomination, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, the Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach record levels", Stu Rodenberg, a hard-hitting political analyst, told the news site.
"They say it's already high, and it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among the group of undecided suburban women voters and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while disliking the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had predicted that there might be a backlash if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets voted out, it's about how Republicans handled it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic election-helping group Priorities USA, told a news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe after the depositions of Ford and Kavanaugh, leaning slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's move, the FBI has taken on the task of investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals while they were at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new spin-off of this tech legend is Inrupt, a company based on the open platform Solids by Berners Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "global dominance".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid platform technology by allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data warehouse" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, diary, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all of them at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal electronic data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this capability "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some contracted programmers who worked on the project and a community of volunteer code developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, overturning business models overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a Medium post released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web being created based on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Tribute to a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was honored in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Van received the medal on 29 September 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won Britain's highest military decoration.
On Saturday a memorial plaque was unveiled by his two grandchildren, accompanied by a parade in Rusden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "highly symbolic" that the plaque's unveiling took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic deed for which he received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion into the Seine-Cendon Canal in the midst of very thick fog and while receiving heavy fire from battle guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "exceptional bravery" led the line forward, before striking alone with a three-gun battle rifle from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic deeds were "something I know I could never reach, it's something that makes you feel boundless respect".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero is proven by the support he has from many people".
MMA fans stayed up late to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa Pig.
Consider this scenario: You have been up all night watching the thrilling Bellator 206, but you are deprived of the joy of watching this unique sporting event.
The San Jose schedule included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was to be shown live in the UK, by Channel 5, in the night-time zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Geoghard Musashi and Rory McDonald prepared to step into the ring, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not happy at all, having stayed up until the early hours of the morning especially for the race.
One Twitter fan described the screening of the children's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"By law, this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so the children's program had to be shown", said Dave Swartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, yes".
Bellator president Scott Coker said the program was being edited to include UK viewers in the future.
"If we think about the replay, I think we can do it", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday our time, which is their Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the switch happened, there was a lot of back-and-forth texting, and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you, next time, it won't happen.
We're gonna limit it to five games instead of six, like we usually do, and we tried to give the fans more, and we went too far.
It's an unpleasant situation".
Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality
Olympic diving champion Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, however, it drove him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize until high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she supported gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since becoming a parent, he is less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular on the popular radio show, had been on sick leave for several months.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said that he felt "inadequate" compared to others when he was growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to like someone both boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference give me the strength and will to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is a prominent advocate for the rights of the LGBTQ community and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak out because he felt lucky to be able to live freely, without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said it was "a surprise" when she fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daly married Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years his senior, but he has maintained that age difference has never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (he competed in his first Olympics at age 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a peer who has similar ups and downs".
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said it changed "his whole outlook".
"If you ask me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal", he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 of brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Daddy, you won't be around to sit in the front row,'" she said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead did I finally accept that he was not invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, to compete in diving at the Olympics in my homeland, there was no better feeling", she said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which cheered him up as he prepared for the Olympics and still gives him the creeps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-of-shape Mickelson will be sitting on the bench Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to improve his performance to avoid being remembered for the wrong reasons.
Mickelson, competing for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was forced by captain Jim Furyk to sit on the bench for Saturday's fourball and foursome.
Instead of being the center of the action, as is customary for the United States, the five-time winner has divided the day cheering from the lines and working on his game in the hope of fixing his problem areas.
With no straightforward driver ever to emerge even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old's game is not suited to the cramped course of Le Golf National, where long-distance runs are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the court wasn't enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces Francesco Molinari, British Open champion, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind in the opening 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mickelson's play could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he was playing today, he patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow", Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he's given so much to these teams, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up and so we felt we had to go.
He wants to go out there like everybody else".
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday games in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that didn't match his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furik said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make jokes and is excellent in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun teasing him this week.
His contribution is not only in the game".
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big lead could be lost soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead starting with the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a loss.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 race at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros managed to gain a five-point lead over the Americans, but barely managed to cross the finish line by a chest gap, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama, we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but barely", Bjorn said, pictured, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're going out tomorrow to give it all.
We're gonna go out there and play it right.
Nothing's over until you see the grades on the board.
We have one goal, to win this trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I always say that I'm focused on the 12 players on our team, but we know very well that there are equally good players on the other team, the best in the world".
Satisfied with his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I wouldn't rush to predict the outcome.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow, it's all about individual performance, and that's something else.
It's great to be on the court with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there by yourself, that's when you put your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message you need to get to the players, how to bring out their best selves tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind and he has to give his all and show his best".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk of the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than they did with their teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both ends of the last day's upsets, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat as Europe performed its miracle.
"I remember every word he said", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had rallied his players for the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brookline, like Medinah.
When we get that momentum, there's a lot of pressure in the midfield.
We decide our order accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we'll try to do our magic tomorrow".
Thomas has taken over the lead of the race and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rum, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the line.
"I went with this group in this order because I think it covers the whole route", Björn said justifying his choices for singles.
New postponement for Germany's new warship
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but it won't be delivered until next year at least, due to faulty systems and soaring costs, local media reports.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a spokesman for the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but delivery problems were critical to the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They'll carry a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature is that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as the new frigates will be able to be used for up to two years outside German ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that while the warships are considered state-of-the-art, allowing Germany to show off its power abroad, by the time they are finally put into service, they will already be outdated, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard since the surrender.
Not much information has been released on the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of significant "defects in software and hardware" that would render the warship unusable if used on a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly significant as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, barely half as many as the older Bremen class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has a much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton frigate Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to weigh twice as much as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) was also an issue.
It is said to have reached a paltry €3.1 billion (3.6 billion euros), while the original budget was €2.2 billion.
The problems plaguing the new frigates are particularly significant as Germany's naval power shrinks.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy "will soon be without ships for missions".
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships have been decommissioned, but there are no other ships to replace them.
It claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be accepted into the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
New research conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to design future actions to protect the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will investigate the habits of the common nano-bat and the micro-bat, as well as the brown-headed bat and the Dobbedoon's flying squirrel in Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld sensors.
Analyzing the sound of all the recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the bats' calls, as well as which species have this behavior.
A habitat map and a report will then be created to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on landscape scales.
Rob Dewar, environmental counselor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as creating grasslands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect their nesting sites and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also a danger, as are fly-tape and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching their prey.
They use a sophisticated sonication technique to spot insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect bat nests, and sometimes rescue them.
The organisation has also set up Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary exclusively at Threave Farm, in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says the property is ideal for bats.
"Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of big trees and an ideal habitat.
There is still much we don't know about bats, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to grow their populations".
It stresses that it is important to check for bats before any home maintenance work, as destroying a single nest of young could kill up to 400 females and young, potentially wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them or disturb their peace, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, head of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to volunteer their help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we just don't know the evolution of their population".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorca in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to the complaint, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not to report anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, this is not a game.
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves and take advantage of my name.
It's normal, you know?
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and all is well", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations it published, which they described as "unacceptable reporting of privacy-threatening rumors", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral harm commensurate with the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorca returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorca claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy", but was betrayed by the other "one percent".
The documents say that Ronaldo admits they had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Majorca also claims that she went to the police and a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and worried about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she's trying to reverse the settlement as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of being transferred to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse and this summer he moved to Italian side Juventus securing a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' loss of car industry
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its reputation as a global leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Barnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", Mr Clark said.
The Japanese car industry said the impact of cross-border delays in a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's chief executive in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern the supply chain risks according to the car manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, resulting in delays and shortages of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock beyond one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clarke said that Mrs May's plan for the future relationship with the EU 'is specifically about solving the issue of border controls'.
"We need a deal, we want the best deal possible that will allow us not only to have a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence coming not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is imperative to ensure continuity in supply chains".
Toyota was unable to say for how long it would stop production, however, it warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Bernaston for 24 years and is Unite's union manager at the factory, said union members are increasingly worried: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they are never going to come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's landmark meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed by another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, the connections of Trump aides with Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington's rumours for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire in order to record his conversations with Trump and allow for the president's removal under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather" not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid coinciding with a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's spokeswoman, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set yet, maybe this week, but maybe another week given all the other cases in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists have disputed this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of the news was not due to a dislike of the "impression" moves of television journalists, although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they are shown".
Then he hinted that there would be increased or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president gives more interviews than any previous president", he said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at those numbers".
Updates will continue to be conducted, Sanders said, but "if the press is able to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's incomparably better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks and it will take the place of the press release where you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with official guests.
Private press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president seems to have shown why this is the case, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance before a gathering of reporters.
The Health Secretary sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health Service amid fears over Brexit
The Minister for Health has sent a letter to EU citizens employed in the Scottish National Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to remain after the UK leaves the European Union.
Jean Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote: 'The UK-EU negotiations on withdrawal continued over the summer and are on track for expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring invaluable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we very much want you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game, where the Tigers were defeated 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean newspaper reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came towards the bench and just collapsed there", Reed said.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the bench and then put him on a stretcher and carried him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no information yet on the type/ extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before retiring from the game, bringing his total to 18 for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for buying property in the UK, with the extra money used to help the homeless, according to new Tory plans.
The measure would neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on buyers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee to buy property in the UK, with the extra money used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting higher wages.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on natural and legal persons not taxed in the UK, and the additional money will boost the government's campaign to fight homelessness.
The increase in the current stamp fee, together with the higher tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes and rental homes, may amount to three percent.
The Treasury expects the measure to generate up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, leading to higher prices and making it more difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the property market.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty so more young people can buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land without using it and called on Mrs May to remove ceilings on affordable housing to restore Britain's "housing disgrace".
Mr Corbyn announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on evictions "without fault".
It also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - to improving lives for each new generation.
And that means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be right for non-UK residents and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hardworking British nationals.
For too many people the dream of homeownership has become too far away and the indignity of homelessness remains".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach the Scotland team"
Sunderland captain Jack Ross says his "absolute ambition" is to one day coach the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the challenge of resurrecting the north-east England side, who are currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, having previously brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a call up for the second national team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up watching the Scottish team in Hampden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in coaching teams".
Among Ross' predecessors at Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo DiCanio. He has also played for the United States national team.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not shocked to be asked to succeed such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now success for me will be measured by answering the question 'can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this team, it is undoubtedly a Premier League club", he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful here if I can get the team back there".
Ross began his coaching career just three years ago, having spent a spell as assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on the coaching staff at Harts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren from the brink of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was more of a real crossroads", he said, recalling taking over as Aloe's coach.
"I really thought I was better suited to be a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, making decent money from it, and I had gotten pretty high.
But playing can be difficult.
You must endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still struggling with the stress and pressure of work, but the coaching job is a perfect fit.
I've always wanted to coach, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable with myself than I have in my entire adult life".

The best time to drink beer is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat has boosted profits for Britain's experimental pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales increase 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the data, said: "The continuing sunshine and England's longer than expected World Cup attendance resulted in July following a similar pattern to the previous month, June, when pubs' profits rose 2.8 percent, but restaurants took an even bigger hit.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant revenue in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcohol fared better, with previous years' figures rising more than their restaurant counterparts fell.
Pubs serving food also suffered on sunny days, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all the pubs and bars operated, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales decreased by three percent".
Paul Newman, from the leisure and hospitality analysts division at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the outdoor market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, but the 4.8 percent annual sales drop will be particularly painful given continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for businessmen in the restaurant industry and time will tell if the cooler temperatures we experienced in August will provide a much-needed extension".
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand name launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales index for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over GBP 9 million and is the established benchmark for the sector.

One in five children - even as young as 11 - set up social-media accounts, which they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has fueled fears that it is sexually explicit.
Twenty percent of the students said they maintain a healthy "main" account to show their parents, while maintaining private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who urged others to rape her ("rape me").
The survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping hidden accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are succumbing to the temptation to create online spaces where they cannot be traced by their parents and teachers".
Eileen Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eileen Doyle was elected as a non-executive director to the Scottish Athletics Council at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and President Ian Beatty commented on her election as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilind enjoys immense respect throughout the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely from her joining the board", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I am thrilled to be the voice of athletes and hope to be able to really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the gold medal in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, having won a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, was left paralyzed after a transient ischemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if and how well I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I do flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An ad for a mammal comparing mothers to cows divides online opinion
A mammal company has divided online with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To launch what it calls "the world's first silent wearable breastplate", consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous video-inspired ad to highlight the freedom the new breastplate offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack full of cows, to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and, "In case you haven't noticed, those aren't nipples, those are my boobs".
The chorus goes on, "Pump it, pump it, I feed babies, pump it, pump it, I milk my ladies".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it does not take the dairy industry's "horror" seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after birth", commented one.

Another commented: "Apparently traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise breastfeeding for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Another added: "A totally unreal advertisement".
Others defended the ad, while one woman admitted that her song sounded "hilarious".
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I'd buy a bottle like that if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I didn't overanalyze it.
It's a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad that targets moms who pump breast milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry".
At the end of the video the women's group reveals that they all danced with their distinctive nipples tucked into their bras.
The rationale behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The Elvie breastplate, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits neatly inside a breast-feeding bra, allowing the women to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside during the pump.
Anna Ballarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and challenging launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenge of breastfeeding and all the challenges it entails, while also showing in a fun and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that a new breastfeeder will bring.
It's not the first time the baby Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two showed up on the catwalk for fashion designer Marta Yakubovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly moved to a camp at the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has soared, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because tough rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to match children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most of the dependents are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid to come forward and ask for a child and thus jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk intensified in June when federal authorities announced that potential dependents and other adult members of their households would have to be fingerprinted and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Alpens, a senior official at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who requested to support unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had a white criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either dependents or dependent households are in the country illegally, and a large number of these are foreign criminals.
The European Union is committed to the fight against terrorism and to the fight against terrorism.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children's cases, officials introduced new rules that some of these children must appear in court within a month of their detention, instead of 60 days as previously, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference instead of in person to present their claims for legal status before the competent immigration judge.
Those found not to be eligible for release will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become stressed or distressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have leaked out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are intensifying in larger facilities like Tornio, where signs of a child's difficulty are more likely to go unnoticed because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the stage without giving them enough time to prepare psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can worsen the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we drive out all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and inform both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said conditions were good for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unreasonable fears" that pushed refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They politicize an issue that should be purely humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a demilitarized zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, home to three million people.
Muallem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be "neutralized".
UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned that no interventions should be made.
Because Trump will win a second term.
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic presidential finale of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of the audience's fatigue.
Since 2014, high-definition television viewership has more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in the high-definition band, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has swept satellite television ratings, with 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand", said Neil Baer, producer of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor", in which a minister becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
Her driver said she would vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked "why?"
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovel said.
You can have fun even in chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens with TV shows, the scenarios coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roy v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Frequency switching is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of an informed citizen when you sit for six hours watching a panel of experts discuss the use of "hours of behind-the-scenes interviews" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin bomber jacket ("a garment full of pus", according to the Washington Post), and the implications of Storm Daniels's glib descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'm never gonna see Super Mario the same way again.
"What it does and what gives you the reality show feel is that it gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the television show "Pawn Stars", about the constantly changing cast and daily twists in the plot of Trump's show (he starts a fight with the NFL, praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you're gonna be left behind.
When I met with Mr. Fleisch this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his home on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
"I remember when we did those crazy shows back in the day and people were saying, 'This will mark the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right".

Foreign money flows into the most marginal contest for the midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is receiving cash flow, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts, which put two incumbent members of Congress up for the same seat.
This recently redesigned Pittsburgh suburb is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected from another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb has another incumbent representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents Pennsylvania's former 12th congressional district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned following a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January that the old districts were being manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th district sparked a campaign of financial competition between the parties' largest financial units, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, which was well-attended.
This seat has been held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts are giving the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, prompting a mild reaction from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", as Heather Nauert, the agency's press secretary, said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received about US$140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for the Central American country, with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings unfolded, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to stem the flow of refugees to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear they wanted the conference to go ahead, effectively ending any thoughts of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is set to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the great importance the gathering holds for the administration, diplomats said.
All three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the conversation described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations on condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Read the history
The next blow may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's obstruction of justice, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumored that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into the possibility of collusion between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to this body as he prepares to run for president again in the next election and perhaps eventually before a jury.
The "ifs" are many and I am not suggesting that the fall of Mr Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tide of history turns around such turning points and the unbridled course of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are now facing many of these tipping points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since it was reported in that newspaper that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and that he considered him unfit for the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein said the version the Times adopted is inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the well-founded charges of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I learned in the Fact, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was transported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, he immigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light the Jewish Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna .
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria after an impressive draw in Spain with Viarreal earlier this month will give them plenty of chances to qualify for Group 7 of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for greater success.
"It was a good moment for us because Villareal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could do something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten away with it in the end, but, generally, the draw was a fairly fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
Well, we can take three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they brought a good result in their last game, but, with the crowd in the stands, I'm sure we can put our best foot forward and bring a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with my injuries and the changes that have been made in the team itself, but there's a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids are enjoying it, the training is good.
Let's hope we can put our best foot forward now, put last season behind us and succeed".
Women lose sleep because of their fear of retirement savings
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Nearly half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to have the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes very early.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy at a purchase price to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property - as long as you have the money.
Draft your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a health care proxy to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and to ensure that health care professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of making a power of attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your aging parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the money, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you have this plan ready".

Police described the incident, which took place at 02:30 BST, as an "accidental event".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening and police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications cut off, aid workers have been unable to get information from Dongala, a region north of Palo, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster broke out.
The following are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongala is a sub-kingdom that stretches along more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) of coastline in the southwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, a tier of administrative division below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main mainstays of the economy in Central Sulawesi province and particularly in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is most common in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongola have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, with over half in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds dead on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale centred near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the Medawi Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-sequence earthquake hits the Pindi Jaya region of the Czech Republic, causing devastation and panic as it brings back memories of the devastation wrought by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but over 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence.
Truck Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew attempted to call the police to report the crimes he allegedly committed, he grabbed the phone from her hands.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su temporary detention store on $500 bail, KTUU TV reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "absolutely innocent" when questioned, the network reports.
Palin is facing charges of three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been prosecuted.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been filed in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice for the crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His partner claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media are circulating videos from the moment of the disastrous event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipoff, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot van to attack a bike lane along West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, dragging pedestrians and cyclists into his path on October 31.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and inflicted serious bodily harm "intentionally", according to the death penalty intent statement filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges carry the death penalty, according to the indictment.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury brought Saipov up on a 22-count indictment, which included eight counts of homicide in favor of a criminal organization, a tactic often employed by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner of carrying out the attack as "abominable, cruel and vicious".
"Saifullo Habibullayevich Saipov has caused pain, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Anhelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Lore Decand, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Panuko", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a case that calls for the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was imposed in New York was in 1953 on husband and wife Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt satisfied with his action, according to police.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack by an ISIS video he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts listed in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipoff, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea for life without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma caused by the events for all involved", Patton said.
The defence team of Saipov had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Faratz should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest rally at the Tory convention.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians needed to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs said he should be leading the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bown told protesters in Birmingham that the UK "would have left" by now if Mr Farage had been the Brexit minister.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was highlighted by the fact that Tory Remainers attended a separate Brexit protest rally in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chequers compromise plan in check amid attacks from Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU.
Allies insisted she go ahead with her attempt to strike a deal with Brussels despite backlash and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihull that he wanted to throw out "the Chequers plan".
He said that Mr Farage should have been given a knighthood and given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we'd be gone by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we have to throw out the Chequers plan".
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Mr Bown rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The assumption that the British people have changed their minds and wish to remain is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit MP Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not accepted by the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, it is not accepted by our party and our activists who are taking to the streets and ultimately electing us.
Please leave the Checker plan and start listening".
In a sharp message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told the protest rally that politicians must be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the political class", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let you get away with it if you do".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our class of politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, pro-Remain protesters demonstrated in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists were waving Tory anti-Brexit banners after the group's rally this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Tories over the security issues they faced with a party application at the opening of the convention.
"They are the same people who tell us they can put in place the information systems and all the technological means they need for the EU-Canada enrichment type agreement, for unimpeded borders, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
"It's a total fiasco.
The EU's role in the process of EU membership is to ensure that the EU is able to take on board the challenges of the future.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during a rally at a western Massachusetts town hall on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November, up against Republican state representative Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It's highly speculated that he could be a contender for Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters using city hall structures since Trump's term began.
A person at the rally asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government and that means a woman has to be at the top".
Arrest for the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Deaton Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11pm Eastern time.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man who appeared in the video.
20-year-old Sims was fatally shot near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which led to his death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene in possession of a weapon and confessed to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resisting arrest and is being held at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6-foot-3, Baton Rouge-raised senior Sims played in 32 games, including 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton goes for world title as his team's instructions handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's commands would play a major role in the race.
On the start Bottas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two corners and called on Fettel to attack his stable.
Fettel went into the pits first and let Hamilton run in the back of the race, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a wheel-to-wheel battle, which forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior reluctantly due to the risk of falling into the double-stepping violation to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then remained first for much of the race, as he held his tires aiming to finish fast and pass Kimi Räikkönen in fourth place.
He finally went to the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his speed for the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen came fourth.
It's a tough day because Valterie was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me in.
The team did exceptionally well and did a couple of things", said Hamilton.
The body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she didn't leak a letter from Christine Blazy Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that events in the Senate proved that people are "malicious and miserable and liars".
"The only thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and malicious and miserable and liars", he said.
"When you see a publication and a leak and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked... No, we didn't leak", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received Ford's letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak was from her office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by the Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as he asked".
But her refusal did not seem to convince the president, who remarked during the Saturday rally: "I'll tell you something, the body language was really bad.
He may not have, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen".
In continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president implied that the Democrats are using the charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the malice, the misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to take power and control", the president said, according to the Mediaite news website.
The Dandy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have made up for their defeat in Friday's Elite League game to the Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy lead with two field goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney tied the game for the home run before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard scored for Dundee and then two goals from Lucas Ludwald Nielsen ensured the team's victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who were coming off a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the scoring in the fourth with 3:35 left with an assist from Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford provided the assist that allowed Bowyer to double the lead four minutes later.
In an action-packed opening period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the assist to tie Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first period.
The fielding team regrouped and Bouchard again tied with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second half and he secured the win with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, now down four of their last five games, play at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of plane passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he lost his life trying to secure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing due to a major earthquake that hit Sulawesi island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are trapped under rubble in the city of Palo.
But even though his colleagues ran for their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in the frenzied control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his seat to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Siret said the decision could save hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpappan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Palo.
"We are shocked by his death", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, while the country's disaster response agency says access to the towns of Dongala, Sighi and Butong is restricted.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under rubble, many of which we have not been able to reach", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purugo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high have destroyed Palo, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere".
Jean Gelfant, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to save survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the work related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which claimed the lives of more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man is missing after plane crashes into a lake
The airline that operated a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports one man missing, while earlier it said all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon it was unable to find any trace of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The causes of the collision and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into the lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down too low.
"That's extremely good", said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to walk through the waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working nearby to improve a wharf also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry people to shore before the ship sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in collisions involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these collisions.
Analyst cites a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors completed their arraignment Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location records from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, refuting his previous claims, as reported by the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's cell phone at the time she claimed to be with his boyfriend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records showed they only knew each other for a week.
Roulett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its arraignment on Sunday.
The judge said he estimated that later that day the trial would be left to the jury's judgment.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has strayed from its roots, which were political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop consciously popular again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common are experiencing a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple who fired her after receiving "racist" text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for racial dismissal after receiving an accidental text message from her mother complaining that the nanny was "another black person".
The couple deny being racist, likening the treatment to "blackmail".
Lindsay Plasko-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed to learn that new nanny Giselle Morris was black when she showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
"OTHER NEGRO'S HOLDEN" wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
Once she realized her mistake, the now-embarrassed Mr. Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had not done a good job and was waiting for a Filipino in her place, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her one and only day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Ms. Morris has filed a lawsuit against the couple seeking compensation for the dismissal and is seeking compensation in the amount of $350 a day for the six-month job as a domestic nanny, for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do stuff like that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discriminatory".
The couple counter claims that they are racist, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared they could not trust her again after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even if by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now".
Likening the treatment to "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you go after someone in this condition?
It's not that kind", the banker added.
While the legal case is ongoing, the court of public opinion hastened to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not be interested in a talking teddy bear, a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the huge success of Paddington".
She said her father, who worked as a BBC photographer before being inspired to write the children's book by a teddy bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bitter as sweet" as her father passed away last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was secretly proud of his later success.
"He was a quiet man and not arrogant", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of it even if it's not really your achievement.
I think that's kind of how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he was a creation of his own imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling me and telling me it was very bad, that he didn't have much hope of making it", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"At some point, Nad called to tell me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly draining out of her system.
He was already dead a few hours before that time and now everything was fading.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should have stayed calm".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapérouse, still mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who were unaware of her ordeal.
"No one knew", he said.
"I had my head down and tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I was overcome with a feeling of compassion for Nud.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women mourning the loss of their own face hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to stop other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang cards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers you can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lindney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up the room".
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a very bad condition".
In 2014, his brother Tyler, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there will be an impact".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Do not be silent - you must speak".
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was down or sad or anything like that", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
She had hit rock bottom on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, she didn't look them in the eye".
He said that his death left them with a huge trauma, but they need to get over it: "It breaks up the family.
He's crushing us to the ground.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited-duration investigation with a limited subject matter - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would dissolve amid persistent party deadlocks.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, they will be significantly weakened in their bid to win the person they want on the nation's highest court.
George Walker Bush calls Senators, pressuring them to back Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is submitted?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to get a majority and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean rebels falling under the rule of Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher smuggling charges were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross compared to the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers defectors illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly deportes them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the delayed denuclearization talks.
The meeting followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to work together on denuclearising the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances, we will under no circumstances disarm our country unilaterally first", Mr Reem said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is instinctively unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made those comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with great emotion, denied the accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening credits, Kavanaugh was deeply moved, at times almost screaming and his voice trembling as he spoke about his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "terrible and coordinated political assassination", organized by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he cannot serve on the Supreme Court, as he showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's excluded himself with these statements and the way he's done against the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi reacted when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his nomination is confirmed and the Democrats gain a majority in the House.
"I will say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but the court he serves on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roy v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kavanaugh refrained from answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't this the time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this great?' "
And women should have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of rage flowing through her, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find that unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was really helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who said that she cried when she was angry, but she had developed a technique where when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are allowed as an outburst of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of a job I used to do in a male-dominated office is of one time crying in unspeakable rage and being grabbed by the neck by an older woman - a cold manager who I had always been a little afraid of - and dragged up a flight of stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to break it to you".
Patricia Schröder, then a Democratic senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called the Monkey Business and left the race humiliated, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"That wasn't such a wise decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign had already started a long time ago, he was behind on funding, so he vowed he wouldn't run unless he had raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men were only giving her $250.
"Do they think I'm on sale?" she wondered.
In her speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so intensely charged with emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of representatives, and anger at sexism - that she felt a lump in her throat.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown", recalls Mrs. Schröder of the press's reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"Did she cry?"
How the US-China trade war can do good for Beijing
The salutary whirlwinds of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, imposing taxes on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week, with new tariffs on US$200 million (£150 million) worth of goods, essentially taxing half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has always returned fire in kind, and recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to retaliate against American fire, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to give it up anytime soon.
In order to succeed in making Washington back down, he would have to give in to their demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, U.S. pressure in the trade war could be a long-term positive for China by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, a research associate with the Center for New American Security, an Asia think tank.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country devastated by seven years (and more) of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to flee their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said aid to rebuild the devastated country is welcome by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe locks in victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The American team has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the top spot as Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Team USA star Phil Mickelston, who had been fighting hard for the longest stretch of the tournament, threw his shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, awarding the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shone in every round of the tournament, becoming one of only four players to achieve 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated in the 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olsen.
The top-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has taken a 2-1 lead over England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup game.
Spanish veteran eight-time Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia was crowned the most successful European of all time at the tournament with an overall score of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy we got the Cup back.
Everything is for the team and I am happy to have been able to help", said Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the bat to compatriot John Rum, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to score all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought it out.
At times this morning we put quite a strain on Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us".
