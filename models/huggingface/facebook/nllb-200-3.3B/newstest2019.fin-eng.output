Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricanes to a home win in the opening round , giving Savo Volley its second win .
After seven consecutive men's volleyball Champions League medals, Hurrikaani-Loimaa started the 2018-19 season with a home win, as Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, a returning player from Romania, was the Hurricanes' best scorer with 22 points.
There were some arrangements for overseas, but they didn't work out, and then I got a call from Loima.
"We got it settled pretty quick", Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Tom Tramp, who also played in Loimuss, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team goalkeeper Samuli Kaislasalo, who played with a pre-match contract, with 17 points.
Winning the opener is always important.
Many players had experience on the opposing team, and that added extra flair to the game.
"Our game is not finished yet, but of course the goal is to continue the medal race", said Kouki.
The most efficient
Miro Määttänen was the most effective player of Savo Volley with 18 points, as the team overthrew the Vantaan Ducks 3-0 in Vieremäki.
We had a very tight game, especially on the offensive line, but fortunately, we got a win on the tight end.
At least I had no consciously different charging when I played against my former team", Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 2000-01 season in the Vieremä Volleyball 3 Series, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was on the roof all the time.
I got a good feeling about the house car.
Miro was king, Sillik also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltalan's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at the Pielaveden Sammo in Tuovinen as head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' leading scorer with 14 points.
♪ The star of Mikkonen again ♪ ♪ The star of Aka-Volley ♪
The 2012-13 season saw Joni Mikkonen win the league's points championship, and he has started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley took their opening win of the season after beating Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
I'm starting the season off on a high note.
Of course, today was a close loss, as we were down 17-21 in the fourth inning.
"We won a round, and the fifth round came at the same time", Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' best player was Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
The Russian Alexander Kudrjasov is back with 17 points.
"We got very little to go on with the guy's hack", Mikkonen said.
Finland is number one in the world in human capital comparison
Finland is at the top of the world in terms of human capital, reports the scientific journal Lancet.
The Commission therefore concluded that the imposition of measures would not have a significantly negative effect on the Union industry.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one higher, and Taiwan was added to the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, the worst performers were Niger and South Sudan.
The human capital measure looks at the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has identified human capital as a link to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, and the home game ended in a scoreless draw.
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was drawn to the scoreline, and the home game between the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late on Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian goalkeeper Courtois was able to stop them.
Courtois played for Atletico for three seasons while on loan at Chelsea.
In the first week, FIFA named him goalkeeper of the year.
The best scoring position was Gareth Bale, but his shot went over the goal line at the end of the first half.
Bale was out after the break because of a hamstring injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real fans shouted the name of Juventus's new goalkeeper, Cristiano Ronaldo, during the match.
The United States is now under attack for its abortion rights.
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump, should be selected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party are hoping that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
The documentary by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg, Reversing Roe - America and Abortion Rights, tells how the situation has developed over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has been doing publicity work against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support from the majority of our country's parliamentarians.
The powerful documentary begins with a visit from gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who, due to the tightening of laws, has become the only doctor in the state of Missouri to perform abortions.
The armed guard at the clinic says he's standing up for religious freedom in the United States.
The news footage is reminiscent of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Men's Association directed women to trusted antiabortionists.
The reasoning of the pastor in question is good, but it is not even necessary, a photograph of a dead woman who had an abortion herself is sufficient.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States in the year.
The Republican Party was the main party that advocated legalizing abortion.
As early as 1967, the California Abortion Rights Act was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, Reagan, in his 1980 presidential campaign, began to turn religion into politics in an attempt to win voters.
His successor, George Bush, Sr., also suffered a miscarriage.
And so did Donald Trump.
The documentary explores the heart of the matter in seeking to justify the politicization of abortion.
When religious organizations that advocated racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
The ultimate solution was abortion.
Religion has brought extraordinary ties to politics.
The President of the United States, who has been accused of sexual harassment but who has seized the religious right with his abortion policy, has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now accused of sexual harassment by many women, as his nominee for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh could have the power of the oath to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots dead seven Palestinians, including two children, at border crossings in large demonstrations
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months of Israeli gunfire on protesters in the border area.
Israeli soldiers shot dead seven Palestinians in the Gaza border area on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health says that two children, a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old, are among the dead.
The Ministry of Health says 505 people have been injured.
Eighty-nine of them were shot.
The Israeli military has confirmed that it opened fire and conducted an airstrike on the border area as protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it's using force to stop protesters from breaking the border fence or pushing it over.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates that 12,000 people have been injured.
The protesters are demanding that Palestinian families be allowed access to areas that Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balloons from the Palestinian side have set fire to forests and farmlands in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty kick . He couldn 't get a shot off .
Wigan's top scorer, Chey Dunkley, appeared to have knocked him down with a rear-end tackle in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward has allowed the game to continue.
His interpretation of the match was that the match was clean.
The Santa Claus couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was a bit of a bother for the referee, Judge Ward, who sent Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was sent off.
Ward got the penalty, and Mario Vrancic scored the winning goal, 1-0.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR in a very elegant fashion with a breast muscle.
The work was good for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he kept going until the end.
He created a scoring situation and defended tirelessly.
Norwich was the fifth game in two weeks.
The team will go on to the League Cup.
There's a five-way tube in the back.
Pedophilia helpdesk filled up with reservations - In Finland about 40 000 people are interested in children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small percentage of women have at least some sexual interest in the prescribed age.
In Finland, this amounts to about 40 000 persons.
Until now, it has been difficult to get help for those who are sexually interested in children or young people.
The SeriE project, a joint project between the Foundation for the Support of the Criminal Prison and Sexpo, trains professionals to deal with pedophiles as clients and helps people who feel a sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in spring, an e-mail list was started in Sexpo, a counselling and therapy service, and appointments were booked very quickly, Yle says.
But they're promised release in the fall.
The sexual orientation of children is a source of shame for many.
Most of those who have felt such feelings have not carried out their fantasies and thus committed any criminal act.
But affection is usually a permanent quality.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also make life more difficult, says Patricia Thesleff, a sex therapist who is specialised in the project.
"I think it's worth the work if one child is spared from sexual violence", says Thesleff.
The leaders of the Koreas or the Congolese gynecologist?
The idea of U.S. President Donald Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize may sound a bit strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize, according to the odds.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least on the level of rhetoric, to commit to denuclearization.
The odds are that the two biggest favorites to win the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and have vowed to work toward a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the Koreas is remarkable, for just last year the relations were frosty.
Yet, rewarding Kim, who has for years threatened nuclear weapons and ruled with an iron fist, would no doubt also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and Friday will be the most high-profile day, the Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to those who have contributed to the diplomacy of the Korean peninsula, one of the top candidates is the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of victims of gang rape at his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become the world's leading expert in his field.
Mukwege's work has focused on sexual violence, a chilling byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that this year's laureates are 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates are not made public.
Trump himself would not object if he got the Nobel.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Everybody thinks that, but I would never say that", Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
But there are some factors that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prize, has often recognized individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and the multilateral world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen to oppose.
In the 21st century, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to three US politicians, all of whom were Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So, to award Trump the Nobel Prize would require a complete ideological shift.
Fire alarm in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like idiots and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic accident in the first district of Lohja occurred on September 8.
The tunnel area was closed to traffic in both the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it was discovered that the system was malfunctioning, the fire department tried to restore normal traffic.
But it didn't work out very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the TC said it couldn't be opened because there were motorists on the road and they drove as they pleased, the duty fire chief Pasi Kääriäinen told STT at the time.
At that time, the highway was opened to traffic even in the wrong direction after only a few moments of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against the traffic rules, a few others often follow, and the head of the traffic safety liaison, Tapio Heiskanen, is amazed.
Traffic regulations say that on highways and tunnels, you can't stop unless you have to.
The traffic safety reminds that in emergency situations, you can not risk traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall always allow the most unobstructed passage possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as is making a U-turn and reversing.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels, where, in addition, the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
Recently, there have even been cases of drivers stopping in the tunnel to clear snow from their cars.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, Heiskanen says in a Transport Safety Board press release.
The fans of Ilves would have wanted to continue the party, even though the boat was stuck in the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans who had been on the M/S Tampere, an inland vessel, would have wanted to stay on board to continue their victory celebrations, even though the vessel had been stuck in the bow of the bow of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's captain at the time of the incident.
The M/S Tampere, which was en route from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, ran off course late on Saturday night and got stuck with its bow on the bottom of Vanajavesi in Aka.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland overnight.
No one was hurt in the drive-in.
"The fans of Ilves would have liked to have continued the party on the ship until morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them by the fire department to the port and by bus home", Syrja told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 victory for Ilves.
According to the weatherman, the Saturday night haze was caused by the water level at the Vanajavater being about half a meter lower than normal.
Another factor that made navigation difficult, according to Syrja, was that the nearest road sign was covered by foghorns, which made its reflectors unable to be seen in the dark.
No more mention of a collision
The accident occurred in a narrow area west of the Jumusensalmi River, shortly after the shipping lane had submerged the bridge of the Tampere-Helsinki highway.
According to Sirja, the incident was not dramatic, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the grounding did not cause a significant collision.
According to Mr. Stern, the seepage has not caused any leakage, and the pressure and the crossings of the ship are continuing as normal.
A diver came Saturday morning to check on the condition of the ship before the tugboat was towed off the shore.
We're going to the shipyard to make sure that there's no damage, Sirja says.
Sir, I believe that the next cruise for the M/S Tampere, booked for next weekend, can be arranged as agreed.
He's gonna keep the cruise season going until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department received a distress call about the incident on Saturday night shortly after 12:30 p.m.
The Vialan port was alerted to the need for ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but the ambulances were not used.
Fire Chief Matt Willman, who was on duty, told me late last night that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult because of the darkness and the rather strong wind.
Pirkanmaa rescue unit reported that after 3:30 on Sunday night, all on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The Trump juror accused of harassment and drunkenness may be denied top job
Brett Kavanaugh, the proposed Supreme Court justice, may well be denied the office he seeks, says Mika Aaltola, program director of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his college days.
Aalto said the doubts have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may decide to nominate someone else.
On occasion, the president's nomination for the Supreme Court has been controversial.
In such cases, the candidate for judge is usually the one who has withdrawn, says Aaltola.
It's how the president has been able to keep his face.
The nomination would be a blow to the Democratic Party .
The U.S. Supreme Court is striving to stay above politics, but in the case of Kavanaugh, at least, the selection of a new justice has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely rain down on the Democratic Party's ladder in the upcoming congressional midterms.
It would increase voter turnout among young people and women, who are more likely to vote Democrat.
On the other hand, the nomination of a conservative justice to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The opportunity for appointment does not come for every presidential term, for in the United States Supreme Court justices are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have voluntarily retired at about 70 or 80 years of age.
Even some Republicans are skeptical about the nomination .
A background check is a normal procedure for candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court, Aaltola notes.
Even though Trump has only given the FBI a week to investigate further, Aalto says it could still bring something substantial to light.
It might.
"There is rarely smoke without fire", says Aaltola.
Aalto said that at least one thing that's certain is that there will be a lively debate about Kavanaugh's suitability for the job before the Senate makes a decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republicans are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination were put to a vote and the Republicans lost.
A woman identified as a Salisbury suspect, a military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she has identified a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
She said that the photos were taken by military intelligence officer Anatoly Chep, who worked for the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously reported that they had revealed the identity of another of the men suspected of being poisoned as Tshepigak.
They said they had already found evidence that the men's current identities are covert identities.
A BBC team travelled to the Far East, near the border between Russia and China, to the village where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman in the village identified the young Tshepigan Bellingcat from the photos published.
He identified the same man from the British police photographs of a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian officials are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the Hero of Russia Order in 2014.
Russia still denies any connection to the GRU.
The men suspected of poisoning the victims said in an interview with Russian television earlier this month that they were in Salisbury as tourists.
Old people in a trash bag in the reform of the social security system
The Commission has now given a living example of what the change limit for the social security reform, as defined by the Sipilä government, means in practice.
The health services of my birthplace Vaala are provided by the Oulunkaari Municipal Association, whose health service director is the former regional director of Attendo, who was elected in 2016.
The leaders of the municipal association warn the council about the change restriction.
If the health costs rise now, the municipality's state aid will be cut in the future.
The city's central administrators were alarmed, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the elderly care system, which would end the in-patient care of the bed department and the small memory-related unit of the health centre.
The aim is to increase the number of home-based health services, which means that in the remote Vala, the elderly living in the outlying village would be taken from their homes to be treated in a "home" next to the health centre.
Attendo was counting on the city to pay for his customers.
The election committee did not tolerate poor preparation, but organized a good public event, attended by many relatives, carers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented at the Söt-Dessens-Dieu how the municipality of Vaala is already taking care of the elderly at home, the most in the whole Northern Netherlands.
Carina Läntinen, the representative of the neighbourhood, was also present.
The local paper made a big story of the occasion, and it, in turn, raised the Oulunkawa preparers to their hind legs.
The war-preparers do not write in any of the papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There's no other service provider.
The producers only talk about the service methods, but do not tell what levels of care it will receive or what staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until the escort care.
Without a nurse?
The reason the health center's facilities are being closed is because there's no doctor's overnight shift.
Attendo will also be using the doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the election shows how central officials are turning delegates into informants and delegates are being backed into the wall with a curb.
The Centre Party is thus depriving Vala of its citizens, since those who remain there voluntarily, if they are able to leave, are not safe.
Was there a central election slogan that the whole country is considered occupied?
Turkish President Erdogan opened the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people showed their feelings when visiting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rein river as early as this morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, there have been several protests and security measures have been tight.
The European Parliament has also called for the establishment of a European police force to protect the citizens of the EU against the threat of terrorism.
There were also supporters of Erdogan gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had sealed off a large area of the mosque for security reasons.
The EU is also calling on the Turkish authorities to take all necessary steps to ensure that the Turkish authorities are able to comply with the international law on the protection of human rights.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild the countries' relations, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
The EU has also called for a "comprehensive" approach to the problem of the Middle East.
Criticism Surrounded the Visit
Both Cologne's mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia's state premier Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old Turkish student, said he had come to the anti-Erdogan demonstration from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't take to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed, and subdued.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's German journey, a significant part of the population in North Rhine-Westphalia is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three men are charged with the murder of a journalist.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said Friday that three people are charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancee in the month of July, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in connection with the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot dead in February with his fiancée at their home in Bratislava.
He had been investigating the links between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
The police suspect that the murders are connected to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and Kuciak's article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of livestock on Sunday in the sparsely populated areas.
Because of a printing error, Karjalainen is also sent without an address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the newspaper in sparsely populated areas, where distribution to the common boxes is carried out by outdoor workers.
The same was true of the Saturday newspaper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The Post Office is putting extra paper clips in the province.
The magazines of other subscribers in Finland are only sent separately on Mondays.
The delivery of these magazines is going to be delayed for a long time.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala, among others, on his live talk show.
Vesa is in the studio, talking about his upcoming space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactic back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was paid by a bank loan.
If the original plans had been right, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
But the departure date has been pushed back year by year.
Now, after a botched test flight in 2014 that cost the lives of some, it seems that things are back on track.
If all goes well, commercial flights will begin later this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means his trip is dated approximately one year after his first flight.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and in the pressure-free state you are at an altitude of 100 kilometers for 5 minutes, the Finnish astronaut tells about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also lays out his longing for space.
I read a comic book called "Spacewalkers" as a kid, and I watched Star Trek on TV.
I mean, I've seen Star Wars, and that's what got me thinking about it.
Why not?
Everybody has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a cruel host
Manchester City continued their unbeaten run in the Premier League as they beat Brighton 2-0 at home on Saturday.
The sixth win of the season for the reigning champions was secured by goalkeepers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to deliver his fourth goal of the season from close range to a goal down when Leroy Sané found him 30 minutes from the back of the Brighton goal.
Agüero raised his own goal to five as he and Sterling tore apart Brighton's defence in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentine managed to place the 2-0 scorers from the penalty spot with ease.
With six wins and one draw, City are leading the Premier League by 19 points.
Liverpool, who are one game short, are still only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round match against the champions on Saturday night.
The youth club has chosen the new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting, which ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Council elected the new decision-makers for its next three-year term, 2019-2021.
The Chairman was Anu Sivonen from Upper Sava and the Vice-Chairman was Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
The council elected 40 full members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Union announced on Sunday.
A youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural leisure activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Congress in Joensuu, Finland, has three promises in its three-year action plan: We will keep our doors open to everyone and organise equal leisure activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we will support volunteering and people in their own growth areas, says the Finnish Youth Association in its press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Raikkonen and said that Ferrari was "very, very surprised" to lose a very important driver.
In an interview with the Swiss magazine Blick, the British agent for Mercedes was asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the end of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel in the points table with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would not be with the team next season, and at the same time, Räikkönen announced that he would be joining Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't believe that the Toad kicked the pants off the dresser.
I don't think Kimi will change for the rest of the races.
He is an exceptional professional, a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that the Raven was one of his models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming about Formula 1, I used to play F1 games on the PlayStation all day long.
I was always Kimi, which is kind of crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues Sunday with the Russian Grand Prix.
The race, which starts at the pavilion at 2 p.m., will be driven by Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes.
The evening paper will be following the race every second.
The football A-Team SM Series championship match turned into a farce: the opponent arrived with only seven players
The boys' soccer league is ending on Saturday with the final round of the season.
Before the start of the round at 13:00, the starting points for the championship match were clear: FC Lahti Akademie will have enough first place in practice to score against Vasa IFK.
In order to turn the tide in the final round, Ilves, who is second in the championship match, must defeat PK-35 and hope the Lakers lose.
However, the Lahtians' championship was virtually assured already before the opening game, because Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahte with the strength of only seven players.
If there had been one less Vaasa, the match would not have been able to begin.
FC Lahti Akademia won the match 16-0.
The Lakers led 7-0 at halftime.
One reason for the lack of players is that the team has played in the same division with the same players in the A-League youth SM, or P20 league, and the men's C-League Second Division.
Vasa IFK has played in the Second Division practically the whole season against the relegation.
In the second round of the finals on Saturday, Vasa IFK will have to beat JBK in the away match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFU in Siilinjärven Toivala.
The car ended up in the Enos, and the rescue services say it was a lucky break.
A passenger car went off the road and ended up in the Enos Juttuvaaran Road on Sunday at around 9:00.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them suffered minor injuries, the rescue service said.
"Luck was on the side", the statement said.
The rescue agency said the road was wet from the rain.
Police patrolled the scene.
The new means of intelligence are awaited: acquisitions and recruitment have already been made, no mention is made of planned activities abroad
According to the head of the Suppo, Antti Pelttari, the intelligence community has been prepared by making equipment improvements and training personnel.
The Commission's budget would be permanently increased by some EUR 10 million when the Intelligence Acts come into force.
The offices of the Helsinki Police (supon) on Ratakadu are already preparing for the entry into force of the Intelligence Acts.
The head of the SOPO, Antti Pelttari, tells Western Media that the acquisition of the intelligence powers has already been completed.
Serena Williams has a stunning video of herself singing topless in a campaign to raise breast cancer awareness.
The tennis superstar Serena Williams is stumbling again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account of herself singing with her hands only in front of her breasts, reports AFP news agency.
The song is from the 1991 Australian hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams is supporting the Australian Breast Cancer Society.
"I used The Divinyl's worldwide hit to remind women to do their own [breasts] checks regularly", Williams writes on Instagram.
And yes, this put me in a very uncomfortable position, but I wanted to do it because the subject matter affects all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is the key to everything. It's what makes a lot of lives miserable.
The Divinyl's second songwriter is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is a tribute to Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer", Williams says, "but she gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first".
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video, the commentary praises Williams for his courage.
Williams pulled out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is a brawl at the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams appeared before the referee and, among other things, claimed that men are more tolerant of violent behavior than female players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not for the altitude-phobic.
The restaurant serves traditional Chinese delicacies as well as spectacular scenery.
An extraordinary restaurant has opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It's literally on the edge of the cliff.
You can look at the forest below if you want.
The rugged landscapes of the high plateaus make the restaurant goers gasp for breath in the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you have to walk through the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to the trekkers on September 19, 2018.
There are comments on YouTube asking where the bathroom is.
A walk into a restaurant requires a good foundation, the place says.
The smell of the corn is going to end today.
All good things must come to an end.
Today, that's what happens to the domestic rural drama The Grasshopper's Lane, which has been quite well-kept.
The third season has gone like a blink of an eye: last week 722,000 Finns watched the episode on television for the first time.
The top festivals themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there is no sequel to the series of the Weakly Creature and the Silly Duck.
In the final season, Jaska and Mirku's relationship takes another leap forward, and Jaska's mother is the first to guess what's coming.
Anssis and Miisa's relationship is also warm, romantic in the light of recent events, but then Laiho reappears.
Even the police are skeptical about the man with the jaw.
But none of you can predict Laiho's fate in advance.
And Anita, on the other hand, will have the most incredible news.
The last will of the far-off is revealed, which brings a woman to tears.
In a week, on Sunday nights, we'll continue with the newest episode of Sorjonen.
I'm doing a street dance on TV1 today at 9:05.
Do you think it's worth going to work tomorrow with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
It's the flu season.
A lot of people are going to be playing the lottery to see if they stay home or not.
However, if you are sick, you should consider whether it is worthwhile to infect others, for the disease can be contagious even if the symptoms are mild.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they appear in streaks.
In the latter case, you may already be infecting others, even if your symptoms seem minor, says the magazine Prevention.
So, you think it's worth staying home?
Prevention says that the flu is contagious even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus can be transmitted days before symptoms appear and from five days to a week after.
Children may be able to transmit the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when your cough subsides and your fever is gone, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid exercise.
Too soon back in the gym will slow your recovery.
And besides, remember to wash your hands, wipe your hands with a tissue, and throw the toilet paper in the trash.
Still excited about the move?
If you have to leave home because you are sick, consider using a respirator.
The mask does not contain viruses, but it does keep the wearer aware of the head area.
Then, Poland says, fingers should not be put in the nose or mouth.
Even the sneezing is limited to the machine.
How could infections be avoided?
The best way to do this is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter, however, is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, warns Poland.
The new Miss Finland repeats the tradition of the Miss: "My husband is a hockey player"
Ice skater and miss are often conflated.
This was also true of Alina Voronkova, 23.
The winner of the Miss Finland 2018 crown has been Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is a Finnish immigrant and her father is Russian.
Because of his Russian heritage, Voronkova was bullied at school.
My parents moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because I was Russian.
I had no friends at all in Pertunmaa, Alina says at the Miss Finland semi-finalists' announcement.
After graduating from high school, Alina decided to start from scratch and move to Lahti to attend high school.
The piano-playing missus also made new friends and the day went on as it should.
At 15, you think you're an adult, but when you look back, you're not.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurri, who is known to Pelicans.
After his SM-liiga career, the hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team in the under-18 World Cup.
At the beginning of their courtship, the couple lived apart for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I were to make it to the top three and that would be the beginning of my career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, trust works well and the good thing about long-distance relationships is that the starting point stays up all the time, Alina said in May.

Almost everyone is concerned about the earth's ability to sustain itself.
And yet, there's nothing you want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to sustained growth are sought, but even the theory of moderate economics faces major problems.
The continuing economic growth over the last few generations has brought to ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, a standard of living that was once only dreamed of.
But the long-term overshooting of the earth's carrying capacity and climate change are threatening to shake this cornerstone of the market economy.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in the back of the Sittator at 4:00 in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing, and another man born in 1968 was slightly injured.
The older guys are already out of the hospital.
Police have arrested one person who they are investigating for possible involvement in the stabbing.
Police are also looking for another suspect in connection with the events.
The incident is being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
Marie Khamis scored a crucial point - Inter coach was upset by a mistake
The equaliser from Simon Silverholt of Mariehamn IF against Inter gave the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt was the first to score in the 78th minute of the match, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
Silvelholt made his way through the right side and lifted the ball over the goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the second game, the Marianas extended the gap to two points on the Turun Palloseura, where the chariot is located.
A very important goal and a very valuable point, as summed up by Maarianhamin's head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said that the team did not engage in the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the Turks' goal brought us closer to the game.
Inter's head coach, John Allen, said the game was under control, but the goal was again painful.
One defensive error cost us a full point, Allen was upset.
We were the best again!

Lehter showed his underwear skills, the place is not yet certain
Jori Lehter's strong underarm performance came to the fore as his NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their final practice before the season began.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehter threw two touchdown passes to Michael Rafflin.
In the last few days, Lehter has been on the radar for suspicions of drug use.
MTV reported Wednesday that Lehter is one of 23 suspects in a drug ring, where some are suspected of using drugs and some are suspected of selling drugs.
Lehter has denied any involvement in the crime.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating.
Following the Flyers closely, Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Sam Carchidi estimated after the game that Lehter was one of six forwards, five of whom would earn a spot on the NHL team.
In the practice match, Lehter was excellent, according to Carchide.
In the second round, Lehter fought the puck himself, dragged the defender against him and threw the goal into the open space waiting in front of Rafflin.
The second time, the duo's cooperation brought home the goal right at the end of the match.
The Flyers will open their NHL season on October 4 with a home game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defensive end Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching staff to decide whether he'll be a part of the NHL team.

I did my best, and I'm proud of it.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL, Vaakanainen said in an interview published on the Boston Twitter account.

This recent picture shows the change: The world's strongest man has lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world's strongest man, is undergoing a dramatic makeover.
British Eddie Hall chased the title of world's strongest man for a long time and with determination.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and weighed, according to the Mirror, at most 200 kilos.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was physically abusing himself.
"The human body was not designed to be this big", said Hall.
A British man was hunting for the title of world's strongest man by any means necessary, and a family man vowed to end his career if he won the title.
Hall didn't want his kids growing up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and was never seen again during the 2018 World's Strongest Man competition held in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram of himself posing with his activist in a significantly thinner state.
Hall writes that his current weight is 530 pounds.
Hall wrote that he now does aerobics five times a week.
The program includes boxing, cycling, and swimming.
Plus, Hall works out four times a week at the gym.
This year's strongest man in the world was won by the Icelandic punter Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, known from the TV series Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was the number one in 2000.
The restaurant ship M/S Tampere has hit a reef in Pyhäjärvi - "Hold tight with the rocks"
The inland vessel M/S Tampere was driving to the shore late Friday night in Akaalla Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department received an alert about a water-traffic accident just after 12:30 on Friday night.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has run aground and is firmly attached to its bow by a rock, said fire chief Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue services, no injuries were reported.
The passengers and almost all the crew have been evacuated to the mainland off the ship.
They are now being transported by bus to Tampere, said the day-care chief, Jari Nieminen, to STT at 1 a.m.
Ambulances were called to Vialla harbour to pick up the evacuated passengers.
The ship, which was sailing from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had for some reason drifted off course on the west side of the narrow Jumusen Sound.
The police are trying to determine the cause of the incident.
Fire Chief Matti Willman, on duty earlier this evening, said the conditions on the lake are difficult because of the darkness and the fairly strong wind.
The rescue agency says the ship's fate is uncertain.
I don't think the ship is leaking.
After the evacuation, the divers will check the situation at the bottom.
The M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum permitted passenger capacity of 180 persons.
The ship also has a private meeting room for rent.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014, and 2017.
The freezing air is receding - check the weather for the day for this
Here's the weather for today and tomorrow.
On Sunday, the weather will be cloudy and the rains will be heavy in the east of the country, in Western Finland the weather will turn to the south and become more sunny.
The south wind is moderate.
Daytime temperatures are between +7 and +12 degrees, with cooler temperatures in the northern Lapland.
On Monday, the weather in the south and central parts of the country will be cloudy and there may be some light rain.
Lapland also has a lot of cloud cover, but mostly rain.
The sun is at its highest in the Northern Hemisphere.
The daily temperature ranges from +10 degrees south to near zero in the northern Cape.
The former managers demanded that Robert Helenius pay them back for the unpaid fees.
The boxer Robert Helenius's fight tonight against Erkan Teper is being overshadowed by the Rahari.
The European Parliament has voted in favour of the Commission's proposal to set up a committee of inquiry to investigate the alleged fraud.
According to the application for legal aid, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We've tried to reconcile, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate and a lot of work has been done", Kokkila tells Ilta-Sanom.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent Iltalehd a reply in which he tells the story from the boxer's point of view.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the sum demanded.
According to his defence, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was agreed that Helenius would only be liable to pay a percentage of the premiums for his matches.
Helenius was repeatedly assured that he would not have to pay anything, but would simply receive the proceeds they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice for professional sports managers.
The Commission is also considering the possibility of a new directive on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to carcinogens.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
The Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market if it is granted through a public or private subsidy.
He found the proposal to be poor and broke off cooperation with Kokkilan and Helmis.
Helenius never fought with Kokkilan and Helmin.
After a year of cooperation, Helenius was awarded a 'severe but significant' fee for his work as manager.
There have been lawsuits this year on the same allegations.
The Commission has also proposed to the Council that the European Parliament should be given the right to vote on the draft budget.
Helenius will face the IBF heavyweight champion Erkan Teper today in Stuttgart.
A man of great heart and a good journalist.
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-time radio host and journalist, has died at the age of 83 from an incurable liver cancer.
The announcement of the death of the driver was published on Sunday in the Helsinki Sanom.
The report says that Pällin died on September 3.
Pälli announced his serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was devastated by the news of the fate of an acquaintance.
He posted on Facebook earlier, as if saying goodbye, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli a multi-talented person who became a brilliant journalist.
He remembers Pällin as a popular person with fast vomiters and funny stories.
I knew Erkki from the time I was a boy, when I first went to Finnlev, at the age of 12, and started as a warehouse boy.
That's when Erk and I met.
He was a Finnlevys publicist and had various jobs, as Ile Vainio recalls.
When I was making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was the regular editor at all the parties making stories about artists.
He was always so attentive and I could see how much he cared about entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right into the skin of the people he was interviewing.
He was a kind man and a good journalist.
He became known to many as the esteemed radio host of Yle, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me a few times, too.
He was good at talking, Vainio says.
Over the decades, Pälli worked as a journalist and as a producer for the Fazer-levy company with Toivo Kärjen.
He worked as a music producer for Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
But Palle's greatest passion was his radio work, where he had a unique style.
He had been working on the radio since the 1960's and became known to many listeners on the Yale ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that its fiscal year ending in May showed a profit of about EUR 450 000.
The Union describes its financial situation as having undergone a 'total reversal', although the economy is indeed burdened by 'a significant debt in balance'.
Mika Kulmala, the CEO, praises the quick response and the strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible by taking adjustment measures.
Careful operational planning and financial management has been instilled throughout our organisation", Kulmala says in a press release.
We've also been very successful in partnering and, in addition, the World Cup's revenue was at its highest in the past season.
However, we must also continue to manage costs carefully and at the same time constantly seek new funding models.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors are gathered for injury and treatment needs assessment.
Patients are also treated outside due to aftershocks.
One of the people who was in the hospital area was a 52-year-old man from Palau, Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and she's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was on his way to school, Baharuddin told AFP news agency.
In the courtyard of the military hospital in Palusa, Dwi Haris lay with injuries to her back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the earthquake struck.
The family was invited to the wedding of the Returned.
I must have been crushed under a wall that collapsed.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
"I hope they're safe", Haris told the Associated Press, according to British media.
Small shops are being robbed .
At the evacuation center, 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her baby with fever.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of the inhabitants of the village have slept outdoors or in makeshift booths.
Even if a house is somewhat erect, possible aftershocks could permanently destroy it and bury its inhabitants beneath it.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the prisoners in the prison in Palu escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were about 560 prisoners, so there are probably about 300 deserters.
Some inmates from Donggalan prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the inmates became angry and set fire to the prison after guards forbade them to leave to look for relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
The airport at Plymouth has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to arrive was an army C-130 transport plane carrying relief supplies.
The airport is the main airport of the region.
The pilots are forced to land without the help of air traffic control, as the control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
The rain will sweep over Finland at night
A long rainfall from the west will spread across the country on Sunday night, reports the National Weather Service.
Rainfall is mostly wet, but in the Central and Northern Lapland, it is possible to expect rain or snow.
The chill of the previous night will not recur, because under cloud cover temperatures will remain higher.
The cloudier night, it's keeping the low temperatures in check quite effectively.
"We are not going to be able to do anything about it", said the weather forecaster, Ville Ilkka, who is on duty in the region.
On Sunday, the rain will move eastward during the morning.
In the south and west, it's cloudy or semi-cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures will move up to the height of Oulu in stages of 10-13 degrees.
Temperatures will remain the same in the south and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in effect for all coastal areas.
No real storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise, the typical autumn weather will be variable.
"The autumn is really coming", said Ilkka.
The Miss Finland final is not on TV.
From IL-TV, you can follow the glamour and glamour of the Miss Finland red carpet.
The entertainment reporters of the evening news are pulling the live broadcast of the Miss Finland final from the red carpet at the Billness stage.
The broadcast will begin at approximately 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from among ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held in the Billnäsi pots in Raasepori.
Before the final, you can watch the atmosphere live on IL-TV.
The live broadcast starts at approximately 6:30 and lasts for about an hour.
This year, the finalists are particularly numerous in number, as are the winners of the previous years.
They will be represented in the jury by Miss Finland 1998 Jonna Ziprus.
The jury is also represented by Jutta Gustafsberg, a social entrepreneur, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, the editor-in-chief of Jouni Kauppa, and Katja Lintunen, a news producer at Seiskan.
We were hoping she'd get into college before she went to the Miss America pageant.
Dimitri's Russian father and Svetlana's English mother believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkov, the parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, proudly watched their daughter's first moment with the crown on her head.
They were coming to the show from Pertunmaa and they were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the arrival, the tension started, Svetlana started laughing.
Svetlana is Hungarian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland since she was a child.
Svetlana says that when she was a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than in her career as a model.
People used to tell Alina that she was so pretty, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It was only later that Alina became enthusiastic about beauty contests.
Her parents wanted Alina to go to university before she entered the Miss Finland competition.
And so it was, and eventually Alina wanted to finish her degree before the Miss World pageant.
We asked him last year why he wasn't in, but he wanted to finish the raft.
The parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy role model for young and old.
He's been working out a lot, eating healthy.
And Alina likes to be seen, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is playing hockey in Japan for a job, and he couldn't come to Finland to cheer his love on in the final.
Alina's parents think that a relationship between two young people can last for a year or two.
Yes, that's the idea!
The parents were hoping that their daughter would be able to come soon.
It's been such a long time since we've had a visit with Miss Signs.
I miss you already, even though I've left messages.
A young man was killed in a traffic accident in Lahore. Police arrested three people.
Police say three people have been arrested in connection with the incident.
The police in Hamen on Saturday refused to comment on the events or to raise the possibility of a deliberate attack, citing the incomplete investigation.
Police also declined to comment on whether the two men were known to each other.
We'll have more details on the case as early as next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - an idea for a cartoon came to her: her lack of drawing skills did not slow down her
"I was a little bit nervous about the fact that I was going to be a writer", says Sari Piippo, a cartoonist, blogger, housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says that she was in Brussels as an EU translator, working in economic and legal affairs, until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've been having a great time being a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought, what would I do as an adult, when even the smallest child was already starting to be big.
Then in 2014, a comic book came into the picture.
Piippo says that he never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Ankaa, Tint and Asterix since he was a child.
I hadn't drawn since I was a child, but when these Genesis manuscripts started to come out, things changed.
I started by putting a few dozen manuscripts in a desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a skilled draughtswoman, but I did not get her to participate until the summer of 2016, when I donated Viivi with a sketchbook.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who says that the comic was a great encourager for him.
A drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, Piippo tells about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
I'm always thinking about screenplays, but I don't usually finish them at once.
A strip of three squares can take several hours.
I can do one square at a time and I like to play with the colors.
Starting to draw is always the hardest part, because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the new cartoons in the newspapers, including Scott Adams' Dilbert.
The characters in the L-shaped theme are a carrot-faced mother with a salad-like smoothie.
The other characters are Man, Piss, and Twins.
In the world of organic food, you are what you eat.
The idea for the show comes from my own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a bath, even though the creature is a little intrusive.
Piippo says she reads the comics with her husband and her children.
It's such a great feeling to look at a cartoon you've drawn and realize that this is what I've done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for a housewife!

Lotus's jackpot was blown up. These were the real numbers.
There were no full-length lotus in the lotus on round 39/2018.

We got two 6s in the Saturday Joker.
Another 20,000 euros goes to the winner of the S-Market Ticket at Vantala.
The other was caught by a Vasa online player.
Indonesia earthquake: Flight attendant sacrificed himself - didn't leave a tower in a crack before he got hundreds of passengers to safety
The hero of the Indonesian earthquake has emerged as 21-year-old flight director Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung remained alone in the control tower until a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people was safely escorted from the earthquake-stricken island.
The young man was on duty at the air traffic control tower at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the town of Palun when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he could steer a Batik Air passenger plane off the runway.
He was able to save hundreds of lives in this way, the Indonesian aviation authority told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
My flight control tower was cracked and ruptured.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
He broke his leg and suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was scheduled to be flown by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation official told The Jakarta Post.
The tremor continued to intensify after the flight, eventually reaching a magnitude of 7.5.
At least 832 lives were lost.
The Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority has paid tribute to Agung's heroism on social media.
The EU is also working to ensure that the EU's trade policy is not distorted by the US.
The trade war between the United States and China is being reflected in the global economy.
The growth forecasts have been lowered throughout Europe, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own growth forecasts.
In the first YLE address, CEO Olli Rehn said that while the tightening of the stakes does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it is weakening confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies' investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports by Finnish companies.
The European Parliament has been a very important part of the European Union's work.
It has been able to build a middle line with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
The Commissioner also stressed the need to ensure that the EU's financial instruments are used effectively.
I have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a rather unlikely partner heading for Washington, but Yule said in the interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the whole of the Western world.
The market reacted strongly yesterday to the Italian government's presentation of a clear budget deficit on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4% of GDP.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five percent of the country's credit stock is bad loans and unsecured loans are over ten percent.
In addition, its public finances are weak and it appears that the country is again exceeding its commitments vis-à-vis its European partners.
The Commission is also proposing a new regulation on the European Union's relations with the countries of the Mediterranean.
Another challenge facing Europe is the UK's departure from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be settled.
A contentious divorce would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as CEO of the Bank of Finland in July.
The President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, will step down from his post in just over a year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen have been mentioned.
"I am sure that it will not be a problem if Finnish names are included", Rehn said, adding that he would not comment further on the matter.
The popular HS Black Box exhibition continues next week with the last tickets to Helsinki on sale.
The popular Black Box events organised by the Helsinki Press will continue in the coming week.
The other performances will be held at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23 The Black Box makes its first visit to a theatre in Tampere.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold at Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers on stage will tell you that they have prepared a long-running true story that has not been published before in any of the HS media.
There's something else that no one's ever heard of.
"There is a strange spy in Helsinki at night, an impressive report from the other side of the world and a telling story about a very topical health issue", says Esa Lilja, one of the Black Box's producers.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the journalists and photographers of the HS and continue the discussion.
Helsinki Sanomat has been organizing live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the start and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have already visited the observatory.
The Black Box was awarded the Bonnier Award for Journalistic Deception of the Year.
The award-winners praised the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to be close to their readers.
The Black Box of the spring 2019 season will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show also visits Tampere and Turku.
The content of the performance will be different from that of the evening for this purpose.
A "pre-sculpture experiment" led to the discovery of a missing mushroom
Finnish police's drone expertise is world-leading: "We are asked for training"
According to the head of the Police Academy, the police can use drones not only to search for missing persons but also for crime scene investigation and intelligence.
On Tuesday, Oulu police were able to find a mushroom killer who had gone missing in Raah in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the head of the Police Academy, tweeted about the incident, saying, among other things, that "through unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are also the world's best".
Drones are a new and even newer phenomenon in police work.
There's no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are masters of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong feeling that this is the case.
This has been clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There's a lot of interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
It would be hard to push visitors to watch the Finnish police drone activity.
We're being asked to train.
♪ And the sky is rising
In the winter conditions in Finland, it is very important to find the missing person as soon as possible.
As noted, in Rahe's case, the lost were found by drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained further.
Drones are already widely used in police work, and their use will become more widespread and increased in the future.
I dare say that, as Himberg tells it.
In addition to searching for missing persons, Drones can be used by the police, according to Himberg, for example in accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence work.
For example, you have to check an area a little further away where there is a potential risk of violence.
The drone can then be used for pre-interrogation.
Karjalan Rugby has risen to the top of the Divari
Karjalan Rugby will celebrate the victory of the 2nd division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Norwegians were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Clubil, but found a way to win the game in the second half and eliminated the southern visitors 26-12.
The Division 2 championship also saw the Karjala Rugby team make a historic move to Division 1.
The club has played in the first division before, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, SM-liiga and the multi-league 1 division.
The club is going to take the place, but it means a lot of work for next winter.
The current roster of 20 players needs to be increased to 25.
Division 1 also means an increase in the number of games and longer playing distances, so the reserve acquisition must also be in line with this.
Homecoming season starts in Montreal, confirms head coach
NHL head coach Claude Julien confirmed on the team's Twitter account that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked superstar Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round as the number three seed in the summer draft.
The forward joined the Montreal training squad last summer and has been making strong moves in the September training camp.
The eagle's wingman scored in his first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps in his development after arriving at the camp.
The NHL's regular season starts next week on Thursday night, Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What makes a good leader?
This week in Finland, there's been a lot of talk about leadership.
In an interview with HS, Nokia's chairman Risto Siilasmaa spoke about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he explains his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila vehemently denied the allegations, but previous Nokia investigations have spoken of the leaders' inability to work as a team; fear and silence, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's ability to take risks and its agility during the rise of the company disappeared.
The Nordic Business Forum, a major event in the business world, was also held in Helsinki during the week, attracting the cream of Finnish business to the Exhibition Centre.
The main event was attended by 12 business leaders, including Barack Obama.
Enough of the leadership talk.
Leadership legend Gary Hamel once said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company into the future, even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain of organic grocery stores, said that a manager needs to be able to communicate to all the staff what the company is about.
And that purpose cannot be just to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the bestselling book about introverts, told me that the most successful leaders are the ones who are humble.
They acted calmly, quietly and with determination.
They're often introverted.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, reminded us that the qualities of a good leader must match the stage of the company's life cycle.
When you're starting a company, you need to know how to tell the story that's going to shape the future of the company.
A company that's grown to a certain point needs a leader who knows numbers.
These lessons were heard by 7 500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.
The danger was the information.
A good leader requires a lot.
That's why leadership so often goes wrong, even at the highest levels.
And Siilasmaa and Ollila were there too.
They were talking to each other on the sidelines, in a friendly way.
But they hardly questioned whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easily appreciated by outsiders.
Sara Chafak arrived on the red carpet in a dazzling fashion straight from Los Angeles , spending most of her year abroad .
Model Sara Chafak has reached the semi-finals in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also had a pitted lace.
A little bit of jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells us about his adventures.
Chafak says he's going to Los Angeles for auditions.
His work includes advertising illustrations.
He describes his work in the US as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
Of course, she has to work harder than ever, for a model's job is always easily replaced.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreography for Sonya Lindfors, €30,000 live art prize awarded in Kuopio
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth EUR 30 000 in Kuopio on Saturday.
Lindfors, who won the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works in the fields of choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her community.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments that previously lacked them, the jury said.
In addition to Lindfors from Finland, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The award is presented annually to an artist or group of exceptional strength in the field of live art.
Danish police find a Volvo in a major operation: 'We can't tell where'
The extensive search by the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Juutin railway and the Big Belt bridges.
All land and sea traffic from the island of Zealand was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
The ISIL has reached the chief of staff of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The car we were looking for has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm from Copenhagen Police told Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo that's been missing, police say it's not directly connected to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet reported on the police press conference on Saturday.
Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He didn't want to say what the criminal charge would be.
Skov, however, said that it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
There are three people on the operation.
The police won't say if they've already been caught.
The paper says the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
STT reports that the police say the general public has no reason to worry, as the threat was directed at certain people.
The name Macedonia has caused decades of controversy - now the people vote on it in a contentious election
In Macedonia, a country in the Balkans, a vote is under way on a proposal for a new name for the country.
The agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece would be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far used its veto power to block Macedonia's efforts to join NATO and the EU.
Greece attributes the name Macedonia to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention the new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
The vote started online, at least in a school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired school nurse who voted for the deal, called for support for the deal.
The referendum is a change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
Since its independence in 1991, Macedonia has been officially known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
The only thing that is more exciting than the result is whether the turnout exceeds the required 50 per cent.
The referendum is not binding, but a yes vote would give the president a mandate to amend the constitution.
The amendment of the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in the parliament.
The agreement also has to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polls close at 8 p.m.
What a win!
Robert Helenius has knocked out Erkan Teper .
Robert Helenius was up against Erkan Teper late Saturday night in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finnish took a step away from his 36-year-old German opponent in the Waldenbuch on the edge of Stuttgart.
The main event of the evening was the IBF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship.
The winner may be able to compete on Saturday in a more difficult challenge with a significant financial impact.
Helenius won the fight in the eighth inning, when he knocked Teper out with a hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get up off the floor anymore.
Nordic Nightmare had already injured his opponent in the third round, and the German's nose was beginning to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight back in December of 2015.
That's when Teper called in an injury and pulled out of the fight.
It was later revealed that the German had failed twice in a doping test.
Helenius has won 28 professional fights and lost two.
Teper, who entered the match as the clear favorite, has won 19 professional fights in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton with the win by extra time , 50 points clear of Vettel .
The Formula 1 championship title was once again close to being confirmed, as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton beat the Russian GP and extended his World Championship lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who had started from the pole position, was second.
Last year, Bottas, who had won the first race of his career at Sotschi, was in the lead halfway through the race, but Mercedes ordered him to pass Hamilton.
Vettel finished third, and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen came in fourth.
Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who started from the back of the grid, was fifth.
Two men assaulted a man on a holiday in Joensuu . They were caught a block away .
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old man in Joensu, near the Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 pm.
Police say the men also stole the victim's phone, among other things.
Police caught the suspects, a 35-year-old man from Hayneswater and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, a block away shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police say.
The victim sustained injuries that did not require medical attention.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, is stepping down as chairman of the board of Tesla.
Musk has made arrangements with the U.S. authorities.
Musk has also been ordered to pay a $20 million fine for tweets that he allegedly secured funding to take Tesla off the stock exchange.
The SEC has charged Muski with securities fraud.
Musk will remain CEO of Tesla, but will also have to pay a fine of €20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in law.
Canada is fighting the clock to reach an agreement on oil with the United States .
Time is running out between the US and Canadian negotiations on the NAFTA free trade agreement.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators have been in close touch all weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, has postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on the trade negotiations.
At the urging of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement for petroleum.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to see the agreement in place before Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's participation in the agreement is not necessary.
He's informed Congress in the past that he plans to sign the treaty by the end of November - whether Canada's on it or not.
The European Parliament has already adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and we are therefore calling for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
A neighbor thought it was a candlelight fire in Kaakkur. The fire department was called.
Candles burnt in a flat in Oulu Kaakkur caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
Dozens of emergency services were alerted to a possible apartment fire.
The scene revealed that candles burning in the sauna of the apartment building had been seen as a fire in the house opposite, which is why the emergency centre was notified.
There was no fire at the scene.
Police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK match, the explosion at the airport and the subway station.
Eleven people were arrested by the police on Saturday after the men's football league match between Honka and HJK in Espoo, confirmed the police commissioner of the Western Uusimaa Police Department, Teemu Värtinen, to the STT.
The reason for the arrest was to protect against crime and disruption.
The European Union has also been involved in the negotiations on the future of the EU.
We've heard about the arrests from Nightly Messages.
The game ended 0-0.
After the final announcement, a large crowd of spectators stormed the stadium for the viewing area reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fistfights between the teams' supporters.
Among the measures taken to end the situation were the deployment of mounted police.
In addition to the field, the raids were conducted in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests were also made.
I was not there, but from what I saw, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the riot that occurred on the field.
According to Värden, no criminal complaint has been filed as a result of the events.
The record was set by the butterfly in the SE time trial at the World Cup, and Laukkanen also reached the final.
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals of the Swimming World Cup 3/7 competition on the final day in the Netherlands.
The competition is held in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Pöytäkivi broke the Finnish record in the 50 meter butterfly event, where he was second in the preliminary round with a time of 22.82.
The first part of the trip was in September in Helsinki, Finland, when the plane was travelling in the direction of the SE at 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was 24.68 with the 24th time of the butterfly.
Swimming Club Laukkanen was sixth in the preliminary heat of the 50 metres breaststroke with a time of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the first round of the 200 meter freestyle Laukkanen was 15th with a time of 2.14.25.
The students are performing a rare delicacy: an ancient tragedy - a simplified Oresteia impressed by its visual appeal
Tragedies of antiquity are a rare sensation on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre last staged an ancient tragedy, Sophocles' Philoktetes, in 1988.
Now the National Theatre School brought the only complete surviving play trilogy of antiquity, Aiskhylos' Oresteia, for a tour starting from the National Theatre.
In the 2015 alkane Lavat auki! projects, students of the Acting Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of the Orestes was in Berlin in April.
The Reconciliation of the Orestes sums up the story of the end of the blood feud of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law, which was duly realized in twenty minutes, especially by summing up the choral parts.
The work is very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuren's fine Finnish version (2003).
The dramatic lighting and revealing display of the theater space highlight the simplified and clear-cut theatrical thinking.
At its heart is the dynamic between the performers, who take turns to break away from the chorus, playing the names, and the chorus.
The play uses both double and triple interpreters in the title roles.
Actors never leave the stage, so the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and Cassandra, his spouse, are also performed on the stage, unlike the ancient tradition of theatrical performances.
Of course, the play does not emphasize its fidelity to the ancient tradition of the play.
Rather, it is before the eyes of the viewer that a modern, faithful interpretation is created, one that is constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in making the acting students in the master's stage emerge as a tightly knit group, as a single organism, a rhythmic group.
Especially in the choral parts, the actors, who are very expressive, and who are very fond of sculptural group formations, can only achieve their rights on the bare stage by decorating the white curtain.
That's very impressive.
The Orstea tour continues to the Teaters of Kouvola and Oulu.
A Korean manufacturer makes its first hydrogen cartridge
The new approach is beginning to be seen in Europe, particularly thanks to the cooperation agreement concluded with Hyundai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
Under the cooperation agreement published at the IAA trade fair in Hannover, Hyundai will supply a thousand new models to the Swiss company and its partners.
By introducing a fuel cell truck, Hyundai continues to be a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles on the road, referring to the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models.
With this first-of-its-kind project, we are taking combustion cell technology even further.
We are also continuously looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by following the development of the refuelling network, said In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor, at the announcement of the agreement.
The two punches were used on several occasions in the Cajaña .
A man in his early 30s assaulted three men in and outside a restaurant in downtown Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The man first struck a man inside the restaurant, which resulted in his expulsion.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and when a third man intervened, the abuser struck him as well.
The police caught the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively, kicking another policeman in the leg.
He also threatened to assault and kill police officers.
They took him to the jail to cool off.
The case is being investigated as three counts of assault and violent resistance to a public official.
In the center of Kajaani, Välikadu, there was another assault on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a male Cajan in his 20s struck the victim.
A short time later, another man knocked him to the ground, and the man who had struck him kicked him.
The outside forces pulled the perpetrators away from the victim, and the police were called.
But the perpetrators left before the police arrived.
The police ask that eyewitnesses to the incident contact the police in Kajaani by telephone on 0295 416 520 or by email at investigating.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Erkki Pälli, the long-line radio operator, has died.
Erkki Pälli, known as Yli's longtime journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Erkki Pälli, 83, a radio operator, has been found dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he announced on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is a go.
The doctor said it, too, living day by day, he commented on his condition to Iltalehde a month ago.
The safety of the store's aunts and uncles must be guaranteed.
I first got paid for a story in 1984.
When a story makes these people wonder, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and even a little angry at times.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert at the Service Industry Association (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't reflect the real situation.
The problem is growing, although the employers are of course saying otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly considered to be serious are reported to the police, and many real cases of violence go unreported.
"Companies are, of course, obliged to keep statistics on their close-up situation under the Safety at Work Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and are not collected anywhere", he said.
Mental injuries don't make it into the statistics.
The problem with violent incidents has always been that they don't always result in physical injury.
Nevertheless, psychological trauma can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
It's hard to distinguish between a violent situation and a threatened violent situation when a certain level of aggressive threat must be considered violence - even if there is no actual violence.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even when the actual action isn't happening.
Some of the neighborhoods are very unruly.
The store has hired security guards.
The opening of shops during the holiday season was also the subject of considerable media coverage, with a view to the safety of shoppers.
"At the time, many employers arranged security services for at least night hours and to prevent people from working alone", comments Kähärä.
When nothing happens, we jump to the wrong conclusion.
This would now appear to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
With the security situation well controlled, the impression was created that the security was unnecessary.
Now, in many places, efforts are being made to find solutions to eliminate costly guard services.
Assault is a misdemeanor, and it is understandable that a salesman who has been assaulted would not want to file a search warrant for the criminal, who usually lives in the vicinity of the store.
But the same section of the 2011 law says that minor assault becomes a matter for the prosecution if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents.
The next time an aunt or uncle is beaten up at a store, the police should be investigated and the D.A. charged.
When the courts put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from there on the hard end of the punishment scale, then the roads would be cleared.
A society in which a grocery store must be open almost all day, even in a small community, must guarantee the safety of the employees.
Heidi Sohlberg was cheering Miss Sohlberg before the live broadcast began - "Sara, Iiro is married, then"
This year, the Miss America pageant will not be shown on TV, as it has traditionally been done, but will be shown on the Viafree website.
The show will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, the host of the NHL and KHL studios in Viasat and Viaplay.
Backstage and the red carpet will be hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the trio gave a briefing to the invited guests and media representatives present on the programme.
Sohlberg first asked the audience to give Harju a standing ovation.
Now all the women are screaming!
Now look at our male conductor, Sohlberg, glowing with his colleague in the audience's cheering.
The upcoming competitions will follow many of the previous years' Miss Finland.
Among others, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg made a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg looked at the Saroi.
More likely, Sohlberg was referring to the recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, although he initially seemed confused.
Sieppi first mentioned their divorce in the weekend edition of Ilta-Sanomi.
Missikaunotar said that she doesn't want to reveal the reasons for the divorce in public, because it's between her and Roope Salminen.
He said he wasn't in a hurry to start a new relationship, that he was going to focus on himself.
I'm going to be busy with my own affairs and especially I'm going to start living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marital status came to light even later when Sohlberg mistakenly referred to Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The three of us laughed at the whole thing.
Iiro was married, or what?
Janni Hussi signed off on the whole thing.
The Norseman tortured the man bound to his open body by slicing, burning and feeding him a strong sauce
The District Court of Lower Saxony has sentenced a 34-year-old man from Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his co-wife.
The crime was committed with belts, cables, and restraints.
The court declared the items lost to the state.
The charge against Rankin was for suspected rape.
However, the plaintiff's claim was dismissed.
The Kokkola case was charged with four counts of assault, one count of aggravated assault, one count of coercion, one count of unlawful threat, one count of deprivation of liberty, one count of gross deprivation of liberty, and two counts of injury.
The offences took place between March 26 and May 24 of last year.
After the last of these acts, the man was caught and imprisoned a couple of days later.
Last Thursday, the Northland District Court handed down its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa Prison.
No sign of rape .
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and one count of aggravated rape on May 22.
However, the court rejected these charges as unfounded.
The case was tried in court behind closed doors.
However, the presiding judge issued a public apology for the conviction.
The judge found that the accused had used violence, threats and coercion against his wife in situations where she was tied up.
The accused would slice the victim with a knife, smoke the cigarette, feed him a strong sauce, and pour water and coffee on him.
By judgment, the court ordered the state to forfeit the criminal equipment: belt and cable, shoe laces, shoe belt, knife and water hammer.
Four witnesses .
The parties, according to the court of appeals, continued to live together between the acts.
The verdict says that a large proportion of the most egregious acts occurred at the end of the period of the offence.
Four witnesses, two women and two men, were heard in court.
The 34-year-old victim is ordered to pay compensation for pain, suffering and temporary injury totalling €5,800.
He's probably not gonna have the money in question, because the convict already owes his old man a debt.
It's not his first time in prison.
The Evening Standard will not reveal the name of the convict to protect the privacy of the victim.
The recent verdict is not legally binding at the time of writing.
Europe four points ahead in the Ryder Cup standings.
European golfers on Saturday captured their lead in the traditional hole-card match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup at the outskirts of Paris with a score of 10-6 with a twelve-two game to play on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four-ball ties that began on Saturday, and in the afternoon quarter-final, the score was tied 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four of their matches as a pair on Friday and Saturday.
No European pair had ever achieved this before.
On Sunday, the two will be looking for more history.
No European player has ever won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and no American has ever done so except for three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
The HJ condemns the harassment of their supporters at the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The football league team HJK published a statement on Sunday condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters at Saturday's match against FC Honka in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the aftermath of the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our fans", the press release states.
After the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed onto the field, and some appeared to be trying to provoke a fight with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The organizers could not calm the situation, and the police were needed, and also the mounted police.
The HJK said in a statement that the players and staff are shocked by the incident.
The events that followed the fight are not consistent with the values of our traditional 111-year-old company.
"We strongly disapprove of any activity that would jeopardize the safety of the match events", the statement said.
The HJK promises to assist the authorities and event organisers in identifying safety threats and in eliminating any incidents.
Fan culture is part of football and it's important to the NHL.
We do everything we can to support positive, joyful and encouraging activities at soccer matches.

A Filipino inventor is flying a drone car to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, a hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He's now part of a growing worldwide community of people who swear to invent a flying car, or at least a version of it.
Its competitors include Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of his device.
Reports from around the world say that the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says, he made the first successful test flight - he flew his device over twenty-five feet [7 m] above the ground.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device elicits a positive response.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Work-stopping measures starting tomorrow will be reflected in childcare and social and health services
The new rules on working hours and shift changes, which will come into force tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors, will be particularly visible in social and health services and in daycare for children, said JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be far-reaching and will certainly be reflected in the fact that there is not enough staff on site.
Everyone has to think about how they're going to pick up their child.
It is now the employer's job to ensure that the services are in play and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also evident at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were on overtime and shift work due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that staff have not been hired, but that employees have been kept working overtime or have changed shifts.
This is not a labor strike yet.
It is a matter of course that the working hours of each worker are regular and that they are the only ones that are worked.
JHL is opposed to the government's plans to relax the protection of small businesses against dismissal.
The Labour Market Director of the local employers, Markku Jalonen, does not undertake to pre-evaluate the effects of the prohibitions on overtime and shift change.
But he doesn't think they're gonna be too disruptive, even though services may be reduced.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the necessary preparations.
The area is so vast, the social and health sector and the technology sector, it's hard to say.
The impact can vary widely by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen said that last week had already been the experience of similar three-day activities by Super, the association of local and founding members, and Tehy, the trade union for social and health care.
They had little effect.
The JHL's prohibition on overtime and shift work applies to employees in the municipal, church, state and private social and health sectors, among others.
For example, family day-care workers are restricted to the outside.
The labor strike at this point affects nearly 100,000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions could take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other actions of the strike, if the preparation of the law on dismissal continues.
The government should now admit that this is a race to the wall and a hard one.
Jalosen thinks both the AI movement and the government have to come forward.
What's so special is that the pipes are already in the pipe, even though the show hasn't been given yet, Jalonen updates.
The Great Barrier Reef is created by the efforts of children and adults . The show 's gymnasts will be studying the movements of the reindeer and the sea horse .
The Great Coral Reef of the Other Spaces collective had its premiere last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's earlier works, The Great Coral Ridge is a work that is built from beginning to end in conjunction with the audience.
However, this time a more clearly defined presentation is also being constructed, which will refresh and enrich the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is plenty of fairy magic in the theater for children to participate in.
The child's perspective is already included in the preparation of the work.
The Great Barrier Reef, however, is not a children's show but a show that involves adults and children working together.
It gives adults information and insights into how children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to engage in practice and play together also reduces the distance between adults and children.
The Great Barrier Reef may be a fairy tale, a fitness circle and a naturalist's consciousness, but ultimately it is built around visits to other, non-human environments.
The Great Barrier Reef begins with a tour of the coral reefs, the life-forms that live there, and the fish that live there.
The six different gyms teach, among other things, the movements of the raccoon and the sea horse.
Finally, a show lasting just over an hour, with music, lights, and glittering paintings and costumes, will help you to get acquainted with the life of the coral reef.
The Great Barrier Reef is both a place for divers to observe coral life and a place for corals to be studied.
And I'm also a coral-watching creature.
The eyes and observations directed toward the coin make the presentation intense and full of life.
To be a landscape of an organism, an organism observing the landscape, and another organism or landscape observing the organism, all of these at the same time.
It doesn't seem that difficult to the children.
In other situations, the group is exercising towards a line of thinking and action that is challenging to reach when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent protest will be held at Sitrator to protect endangered corals.
The devastation beyond human comprehension must not be allowed to harden, even though it may be difficult to see the value of our own exercising compassion in the face of such devastation.
In other spaces, he has constructed his work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, also through a political gesture.
There are other generations, other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, whose wonder and their discovery it will make room for.
Kids grow up too fast. I'm glad I didn't have a smartphone when I was a kid.
Today's children and youth are more irresponsible than ever.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they're younger and younger.
I think kids should be kids all their lives, and not mess up their lives with drugs and sex, because that's what other people say they're doing.
I was stunned when my friend told me that he had to pick up his sister in fifth grade from her "boyfriend" for the weekend.
When he came to pick up his drunken sister, she told him about her sexual experiences that night.
I can't imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned all our childhood that drugs are off limits and sex is for grown-ups.
I wish that today's children could have a proper childhood and not have to grow up too early because of peer pressure.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram with pictures of makeup on their faces and revealing clothes on their faces.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing photos in the evening.
It's harder to tell how old a girl is than it is to tell her age.
It's easy for a 13-year-old to look 18 and older.
My childhood was spent playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm so glad I didn't have a smartphone when I was a kid.
I was allowed to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to worry about what people thought of me.
General: Authorities told the State Director that Airiston Helmi's case was not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who interviewed Yli, the protection police and the defence forces informed the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the Airiston Helmen investigation is not currently related to national security but to organised crime, reports Yle.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Yelle Defense Committee.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the protection of the environment.
This is primarily considered to be a financial crime.
They were very strict about not speculating that there was more to it, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yale.
According to the information above, no evidence of a connection to national security has been found in the seized material so far, but the investigation is still in its infancy.
We have no way of knowing what might be revealed, says one of those interviewed by Elle.
The large-scale house searches that began last week in the Turun Islands and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely about economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
The Evening News ran a story earlier this week, reviewing the arguments for and against.
Video: The dream goal saved the series that Liverpool lost
Liverpool's 100 per cent start to the Premier League came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will mark exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away to win 1-0 away.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the whole Super League that City were now serious.
Everybody remembers how last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the season with six consecutive victories in the National League.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be in control of his own pitch.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great away League Cup win at Anfield Road on the weekend.
Eden Hazard came off the bench to win the match with a spectacular individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was in the mix from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he was in a small space, playing a trio with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard leaping forward and sent him a perfectly printed pass.
Hazard went a little bit over the edge of the penalty area, but from there he bombed a perfect left foot into the back of the draw.
The pool bra's Alisson was a little slow in his tackle and only got his fingertips in the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss slightly unfair, as almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger took Mo Salah's lead off the line.
In the second season, Chelsea's Kepa, the bartender, also got into action.
The Basque guard responded quickly to Sadio Mane's pull and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into the corner pocket.
And in the second half, Alisson scored with a throw to Hazard's line.
The best guest spot came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his interception.
But the brass star's shot was directed at his national team mate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
And that was all but over in the 89th minute, when substitute Daniel Sturridge was given free reign to shoot from 25 yards.
Sturridge was playing at his old home stadium, and the offensive lineman bombed it in celebration of an irresistible upside-down run.
Liverpool's 100th league start came to an end in a 1-1 draw, but they're still in the league together with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly in the championship, two points behind the leader.
The clock-switching debate is deep in the trenches.
I remember a few decades ago a magazine asked different Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
The only answer Juice Leskise could think of was "Nose-head".
Some people have a nose tip in their last name, and some people don't.
I mean, you can have a distribution line anywhere, and there was one bidder.
Finland has achieved the EU's goal of abandoning the annual clock change.
Many will agree that changing the clocks twice a year has been foolish and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution, at least in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The difficulty now is to decide which time zone will eventually be reached: the present day, summer, or winter time, or some other time zone.
The public can also express their views on this on the otakantaa.fi website.
The survey was launched by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday, October 12.
There's a lot of heated conversation going on at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has a say.
Those who favor winter time base their view on the effect of morning light on people's well-being, and those who favor summer time on the effect of evening light on people's desire to go out and thus to enjoy themselves.
Both sides have strong supporters and sound arguments.
Studies have even shown that morning light can rhythm your day and give you a sense of purpose.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, lighting increases the mobility of people outside and gives better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated per hour.
I'd love to have both, but unfortunately, with our location in the northern hemisphere, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
Typical of debate on this subject is that one's own view is pursued and that of another is vehemently opposed.
You don't hear the other side's arguments very often, because it's how you feel about it that matters.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other head.
That's a waste of powder.
It is a subject of great ease for discussion, for it requires no great effort and is justified by mutual feeling.
The debate on similar matters is usually more intense and equally fruitless.
It's a shame if the wrong choice is made, but I think he'll adjust to it.
And it always provides the perfect scapegoat if life seems so monotonous.
Josba fought for the spot of the guest victory
Josba's first away game at the Salibandy Divaris was against Nurmo Jymy with a full three-point series.
Josba left the Seine River for home with a triumphant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led with a goal at the start of the third period, but Josba was getting the compounds and recycling the men in chains.
In a time of 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi drew the 6-5 winning goal.
Both teams played decisive minutes in the break with a draw.
The most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second round was also a fiery one, with Teemu Tuhin (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hitting.
Miika Kosonenki (1+0) also played in the secondary at the time of his birth.
Joshbal has six points after three rounds of play.
The next one is O2's "Should I Stay at Home" in two weeks.
I'm not going to church on Sunday.
The 200th anniversary of the church of Enon will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, in a somewhat sad atmosphere.
The fire at the church in the town of St. George's last week was a shock.
Uncle's church was also guarded for two nights after the fire.
But despite the pain, today is still a day of celebration.
Though no one would like it, the church of Eno is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregational Union.
The church on a hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the city councils and other associations in the world.
The family mass starts at the Enon Church today at 10 a.m.
After that, we'll move to the parish hall, where we'll sit at a cattle bar.
There's all kinds of stuff on the show all day, both inside and out.
For example, the church building can be visited by Ari Räsäs, a retired pastor who served for 37 years.
The Church's birthday also marks the end of an era.
The disused 1982 Congregation Hall will open its doors for the last time today.
Now we are in the old town hall, says the chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The meetinghouse was destroyed by internal air problems, but the church has stood its ground for the past 200 years.
Elon Musk steps down as chairman of Tesla - $40 million settlement on fraud charges
The electric car maker Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being ousted from the company he founded.
But Musk will remain as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk is forced to step down as Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
The company will have to hire an outside chairman of the board.
Musk will also be subject to increased surveillance.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent executives and to monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The purpose of this decision is to prevent further market disruption and disadvantages for Tesla shareholders", said Steven Peikin, chairman of the SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk tweeted that he might be taking the company public.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
The tweet momentarily boosted Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Muski of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and that Musk had not discussed the arrangement with the company's other management or potential investors.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from ever serving on the board of publicly traded companies again.
The SEC's call startled investors, and Tesla's stock plunged sharply.
Over 800 people killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency, AFP.
The death toll is expected to rise as the damage is still being investigated.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final number could be in the thousands.
Friday's earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck the town of Palun on the island of Sulawesi.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the earthquake, but it was quickly reversed.
Officials say that almost all the known deaths are from the fire, at least for now.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the quake's epicenter, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
Calls for Help From Ruins
The Indonesian military has been alerted to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodo, who arrived in the affected area today, urged the military to continue the rescue work day and night without tiring.
One of the focal points of the rescue efforts is the hotel in Palusa, whose ruins are believed to still contain 50-60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency that is leading the rescue, said that one person was dug out alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, a favorite of business travelers.
We also heard people crying for help, he said.
According to Syaugin, heavy demolition equipment would be needed quickly in the area of the earthquake and tsunami.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help, you in Palusa and the surrounding area.
My friend's family members are still missing, and one of the writers pulled a Facebook group.
Phone numbers of politicians leaked to harassers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked due to the app's hidden flaws.
Among other things, the intruders had access to the phone numbers of government ministers.
The application in question was used by the governing Conservative Party in the UK.
For example, Brexit-driven Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were targeted for harassment.
Several members of Congress have received harassment calls.
The app's encryption failure allowed the public to access the profiles of politicians on the app, which was the mobile app for the annual Conservative Party conference.
The audience accessed the profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily available online.
The user logged into the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture to a pornographic one and the title to an offensive one.
They replaced Michael Goven's profile picture with a picture of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the logged-in can view the contact information of the profile person and perhaps send messages on his behalf.
The conference app made every journalist, politician and attendee's phone number public, Foster criticized.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party apologised for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the app is now running safely.
The ICO, the UK's information authority, is backing the leak.
The app was developed by Crown Comms, an Australian company.
The opposition Labour Party has criticised the Conservative Party for not being reliable in security matters.
Every week, a large crowd of Polish people applaud The Wall Finland.
The watchful viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of the TV program The Wall Finland.
The Wall, an American format that has spread rapidly around the world, was launched in its Finnish version on Nelos last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasosen, was filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
The Polish studio had exceptional filming facilities, since the large, 40-foot-high screen required a lot of space.
During the launch, social media highlighted the show's studio audience, which was dubbed Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finland.
Unne Sormunen, head of the Fourth's domestic programs, will explain the situation to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes the players' relatives, other Finns, Finnish people living abroad in Poland and Polish spectators.
The audience is made up of international applauders in the Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, there are also groups of so-called professionals who go to the filming of various programmes, according to Ringer.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to tell apart.
However, for foreign-language students, interpreters are available at the studio to do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously for the studio director all the time.
And then the studio director will instruct the audience and tell them what kind of laptops are being thrown there and what the situation is like", says Sormunen.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was dealt with in the domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago in the filming of Talent Finland in Finland.
He had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear and he knew everything that was spoken in the descriptions in Finnish, the Sum of the Rings.
A typhoon that has torn the southern part of Japan is moving toward the main island . Authorities warn of landslides and flooding .
Authorities are also warning of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in the Taifun Tramway, but authorities say major injuries have been avoided and no deaths have been reported.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars over.
According to public broadcaster NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters, and over 300,000 homes have lost power.
Over a thousand flights have been canceled, and bullet trains are grounded in some places because of the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka at around noon Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly in the storm's path, but it too is expected to experience high winds and heavy rain.
The train services in Tokyo have been cancelled today.
The meteorologists say Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The skies of the edges darkened even more
The A's have had a bad start to the season.
The sky was almost dark when the team lost on Saturday at home to Vaasan Sport with a score of 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Porlains now have five consecutive losses and two points from six rounds.
No Ace defender or player in the bottom two chains has scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
The crowd poured out of the stadium with just over half the game left.
We've only played six games, and there's no reason to give up.
You'd think they'd be worried, 'cause that's how bad we played.
The performance in the second round was shamefully bad, said Jarno Kärki, who made the 1+2 effects for the Axis.
The sport naturally wanted to win.
The team was down Friday night, so you'd think it would show up in the making.
Maybe it was there, but the Aes was not able to use it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, is in the great hall watching the event and wondering how many people are there.
Somehow he thought that maybe this year there won't be so many people coming, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the Traktorikynnö SM competitions were held simultaneously with the Bread Day, so perhaps it was expected that the audience could even decrease a little from the previous year.
However, the hallways were full before ten o'clock, the vendors were telling us that they were out of food, the newsletter was sold in more than the previous number of nearly 500 portions, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars had also increased.
The estimated attendance is around 6,000, Hyvärinen will tell us later this afternoon.
The morning and afternoon hours of five were especially full of programming for families with children, which may have attracted them to the record-breaking crowd.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
The sellers also come to Lipper from a larger area each year.
This year, almost 100 exhibitors, craftsmen, bakers and harvest-makers had joined the bakers.
Mother of the day, the fairy godmother, the fairy godmother, was delighted to see the crowd in the hall.
At the beginning of the day of bread, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
The children's bread competition received 11 different shapes of bread.
The winner of the roasting contest, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day at the pie factory in the marts.
# Seven times the most beautiful lamp # # That 's how you know a good lamp #
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the decor, and read the book without tiring your eyes.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We've put together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tip was given by Innolux's sales and marketing director, Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do your eyes a favor.
The more years are behind, the more important the enlightenment.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people experience as they age, as the accuracy of their vision decreases and the number of people who suffer from glare increases.
As you get older, you need more light.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
So the health benefits of light and the properties of lighting are worth investing in.
A good lamp will provide enough light, but not glare, advises the Witch.
♪ Make a beauty around you ♪
The right lighting is the key to a beautiful interior.
The interior designer of this moment has a choice.
The popular style is the Japandi, a style that combines the Scandinavian style with Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 1970s, with its strong colors, different metallic tones, or ice cream colors, has become a boom.
The authenticity is as compelling as any other decoration in the home.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bamboo.
Exhibiting Your Personality
On the other hand, home design is more important than ever, and furnishing has become a way of expressing oneself.
Instead of mass production, people want a tailor-made, bold light fixture with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, Jokineemi says.
You may not be buying the latest trendy lighting, but a timeless classic that you have been saving for many years.
"Certain timeless, ornate and elegant classics will remain in fashion year after year", says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
Koo Koo gave the Canadian a home run in the third .
KooKo and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell are on the move.
The Canadian forward played a total of three La Liga games without any power, KooKoo reports in its press release.
O'Donnell joined KooKo in August on a one-year deal that included a trial run that ended in September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played in the KHL for Kunlund Red Star and in the KHL farm VHL KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no word yet on O'Donnell's new team.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - the goods are going out into the world in recycling boxes, plastic turned into paper
The specialty games store Pelimies now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the customers of the stoneshop are no longer packed in plastic bags but in paper bags made from recycled material.
For example, products ordered from online shops are packaged in packaging received from importers.
All packages that come in are recycled.
We can use the boxes dozens of times, as long as the package is in a condition to be used, says Ville Puurula of Oulun's Player.
The company's main use of soft material is newspapers and other similar recycled material.
The dome doors are to be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we plan to move into recycled envelopes.
The business wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is not an extra effort, according to Puurula.
It's not a big deal to start recycling.
There are also financial savings, for example, in the recycling of cardboard packaging.
Recycling is a natural fit for the business of Gälimann, as, in addition to new products, the core product range of the business includes used games and equipment.
Every fashion-conscious acquisition: One shirt works on every outfit
Classical clothes work in a different season than in a costume.
Their versatility creates a good foundation for a wardrobe, since it is easy to assemble various costumes around high-quality classics.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knits.
This category includes the black pole.
A black thread made from natural materials with a rounded edge cannot be faulty.
The garment can be combined with trousers, blouses, or jeans, creating a tight-fitting outfit or a tight-fitting outfit.
The pool table is suitable for both the younger, modern wearer and the classical, refined stylist.
That's how you create style.
The autumn trend is created by gold brown and wide-brimmed panty hose, black polo shirt and grey ankle boots.
The classic pool apron, together with the other classics, the blue-green scotch-breasted hat and the wine-red loafers, make up a feminine and sophisticated ensemble.
Bring the black pool to life by combining it with the trendy items of casual wear: a thong skirt, high boots, and thick socks.
Young and classy!
Russian intelligence agencies have a long history of sabotage .
There is no reason to assume that the SVR or GRU of the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service would have abandoned this policy.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian words "diversion-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa" which means "sabotage and intelligence group".
The Soviet secret service, the KGB, had agents in the West who drew up detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says Vasili Mitroh, a KGB archivist who defected to the West (1922-2004).
His data was published in the books of Christopher Andrew in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries, and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB provided DRG teams with Bundeswehr, railway, guard and road worker uniforms and equipment for covert operations.
This is the trick used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they donned the local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on the mainland roads leading to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from its motherland.
During the Cold War, agents hid supply packs containing mines, explosives, detonators and communications equipment for sabotage groups in the countryside.
As late as 1998, a KGB cache was discovered in Switzerland, blown up by an anzamino spray when authorities sprayed it with water cannons.
Police caught four drunken drivers in the county last night.
Police caught four drunken drivers in various parts of North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In the spring, an 18-year-old man in County West Virginia blew a 1.57 from a gas heater.
He drove two passengers at 4:30 a.m. to the start of the Cayans.
A car crashed into a ditch at 4 a.m. in the Polvijärven Quarantino, and a 19-year-old local man, who was the only person in the car, blew up 1.54 promille, according to police.
He didn't sustain any serious injuries to his outer limbs.

HPK will keep Riska in their ranks for the rest of the term, Lehtinen's probationary period is over
Mika Toivola, the director of sports at Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important for the team in the starting line-up, in the second-row and in the defensive role in the fourth-row.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn, will continue in the final season at Hämeenlinna HPK.
The success of Riskan, 33, in the roles offered to him, ensured a follow-up.
Filip has been very important to us in the opening of the piece, in the weak play and in the defensive role in the fourth.
"We are very happy to have a new player in the squad, but we have to be careful with the way we play", said HPK's sporting director Mika Toivola in a club statement.
Toivola says that the value of the Riska goes up when he plays the hockey league's deciding games.
Riska is a centre forward from Pietarsaare who has played league football for JYP, Lukos and Sport.
The team's striker Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the trial period.
In a true story on TV today , a climber was left for dead twice .
An American, Beck Weathers, wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
The movie tonight is based on them.
Everest is now premiering on Finnish television.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm caught the climbers on Mount Everest.
The 2015 film by Baltasar Kormákur is about the struggle for survival, which has been treated in a nutshell.
This tragedy has been made into movies and documentaries before.
The facts of the case are being reviewed here as well.
Twenty-two years ago, the world's highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders, Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye operation he had before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of this and the air pressure, he lost his eyesight, which meant that the summit had to be abandoned.
Rob Hall went on his way and never came back.
But the struggle between life and death for Weathers had just begun.
When the storm came, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to camp.
When the search was launched, he was found in such poor condition that it was not believed he would survive.
Weathers was left for dead.
But, as if by a miracle, he was able to get back on his feet and find others.
The ill-tempered Weathers was thought to be still dying and was once again left to his own devices.
It is clear that, contrary to all expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, his fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility, so much so that they gave him help.
In the movie, Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other cast members include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is the 200th anniversary of the church of Enon.
Today, the 200th anniversary of Enon Church was celebrated on the church hill.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and a family feast was prepared for Sunday in honor of the jubilee.
The festivities began at 10 a.m. with a family mass at the church of Enon, followed by a cattle banquet at the Enon parish hall.
The church was packed.
There were 517 people in the family.
Uncle Armi Rautavuori, the church's pastor, was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and will give strength to the work, says Iron Mountain (pictured).
The fire in the church of St. Francis has affected many, and it was not ignored in the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the parish of Enon.
The church of Enon is now Joensuu, the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran churches, after the St. John's Church was destroyed by fire.
The wooden church of the Strict Observance was completed in 1770.
In the heat of the morning, a religious service was held to silence and remember the church destroyed by fire.
Photos and videos: The Medieval flash of power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type storm swept southwest of Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or hurricane, is called Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red alert for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
Photos taken from the area show a lot of flooding all over Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between the houses in the city of Kiaton in the Corinth region instead of a street due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been swept away by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused heavy sea traffic.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy urges you to follow the weather reports and the instructions of the local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane or hurricane brings with it heavy rains and even flood risk.
According to CNN, a study published in 2011 found that the medusa occurs only once or twice a year around the world, typically between September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left its tracks in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and into Europe.
Concerns have also been raised in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to adequate shelter.
The storm also hits areas around Athens that are devastated by summer wildfires.
In Greece, my medication was also rampant last November.
We must not go to sea now, the flights are still on schedule. Thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the Greek islands, threatened by a winter storm.
Excursions to the sea are canceled, and even when walking, care should be taken to avoid being caught in a storm by vomit or other debris.
These are the instructions that guides have given to more than 3,500 Finnish holidaymakers in Greece during the weekend of the Sunshine Tour.
The instructions are in order, as even a hurricane of horror-to-the-horror magnitude, Zorbas, is predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, winds can reach speeds of up to 150 feet [45 m] per second.
The heavy rains add to the bad weather.
All those who have indicated their phone number and travelled to Greece from Finland via Aurinkomatko and Tuin have been warned by text message about the strong winds.
♪ Still in the air ♪ ♪ Sunshine and warmth ♪
According to Inka Ikos, a specialist in the field of solar travel communication, by early Saturday night, the worst had been avoided in the holiday destinations.
For example, flights have landed and taken off on normal schedules.
Of course, we'll be monitoring the situation at all times.
Safety first.
According to Antonia Schroderus, a friend of Tuz's, their flights have also been on schedule.
We're in constant contact with our personnel on the ground.
At least Crete was still peaceful, he told me early Saturday night.
The most popular islands in Greece, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of more than 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred travellers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos will arrive on Sunday morning.
On Saturday afternoon, the temperature in Toosa was 27 degrees Celsius, according to the Ikonen of the Sun Wanderers.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a report on the implementation of the agreement.
The Commission has already contacted Turkey and our staff there, and checked the number of Finns who have flown to Antalya, for example, says Schroderus.
Shirley Karvis and Janni Hus wore identical evening gowns in the Missal final - this is how they reacted to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived in the Miss Finland final on Saturday in a revealing evening gown.
Hussi says he got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening gown was also worn by host Shirly Karvinen.
The twin also noticed his similar attire and laughed at the situation.
Karvinen told Night-Shamon that he was busy with preparations, and he had to lie down on the plane.
Hussi will be backstage and red carpet host for the miss-final, and will interview the front-row stars who will be attending.
Hussy has a recent move because he moved from Kamp on Friday to the remote island
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
It's important that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi thought.
Before moving to Greece, Hussi was on holiday alone.
It was wonderful. I was in a hotel for a week, and I never left.
"When the stress was over, I got a cold, but otherwise, the vacation was really successful", Hussi says.
Shirly Karvis 's behavior on the plane drew a lot of attention , garnering curious glances from the pensioners .
The host and Miss Finland 2016 Shirly Karvinen told the Miss Finland final on the red carpet that she had enough to do with radio hostess and Love Island Finland pictures.
The rush has even been enough for Karvinen to reach the final directly from Finnair's flight.
I put on makeup and I put on hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
I'm changing my evening clothes at home, and Karvin is laughing.
Karvin says he's been putting his makeup on in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also caught the attention of his fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in it.
I was wearing makeup. I was amused.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
Marbella, he's only there a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his time as host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience of being so far also stopped.
Karvinen says he went to the singles' show on Friday.
It's kind of raw.
They're real human feelings, and Karvin describes the feelings of the show's singles.
How do I put on my high-tops?
Three perfect examples
Classic garments are items of clothing that function from one period to another in a costume other than a costume.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes the most modern ones can be included.
The super-generation boots that became the fall and winter hit a few years ago have not gone anywhere.
True to its name, the knee-high boots are elegantly repeated from year to year and from season to season.
The boots that look good share the opinions of the users, but the bold ones are worth trying, well, bold.
The upper-class boots are suitable for virtually any type of living arrangement.
Whether it's jeans, tights, tights or knitwear, a simple leather or synthetic surface will do the trick.
Long boots look good in formal wear as well as casual wear.
Black high-end boots are a good fit for even the most damned outfits.
They perfectly balance the feminine qualities of a pink, floral plush skirt and a soft, plush crochet.
A delicate yet elegant everyday garment of autumn with a romantic flavour.
The strong, slightly retro look is created by a long copper-brown velvety suit, high-heeled boots, flashy earrings, and a knitted necklace.
Although they have a certain elegance, the high-end shoes also fit perfectly into casual casual wear, along with a t-shirt, long shorts, and a trendy jacket.
It's so easy, but so elegant.
Two robot cars are starting to circulate in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and will be carrying passengers, the city of Espoo has announced.
Otaniemi's robot cars will act as a bus simulator, as the region is due to start using the robot bus next spring.
The project will develop and pilot a year-round robotic vehicle transport and test the technical performance of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will determine how the robot cars will cope with the current street grid.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop the technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, head of traffic management.
For the first time, robot cars will be able to drive in the middle of other traffic completely automatically, without any special traffic controls.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with a number of different sensors and are evaluating whether the lane is clear.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
The robot cars will run three days a week throughout the fall: Tuesdays from 1 to 3:30, Wednesdays from 10 to 15, and Thursdays from 10 to 15.
The robot cars will stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
The robot cars recognize the stops from the stop signs.
The most reliable way to get on is from the number one stop on Otaka Island.
The bass player for the band Mokoma fell off the stage during a gig and got hurt.
Mokoma-yhtye is informing on their Facebook page about the surprising situation at the Tampere Package Room gig.
The band's performance at Tampere Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was playing the last song of the night.
This guy's got a broken wrist.
The band announced on their Facebook page.
"We are in the wind!"
Santtu tripped onstage last night in the Ice Room in the final act and broke his wrist.
Let's all wish a speedy recovery for our brother of metal!
The rest of the tour is done by a substitute, the page says.
Fans of the band Mokoma are responding with concern to the photo shoot, which shows bassist Santtu lying on the bed with a cast in his hand.
This is news that's been anticipated, and there was a lot of concern about how bad it got.
It's a great relief, and fortunately, your bones are healing over time.
Cheers and a speedy recovery for Santa and a great tour to the rest of the band plus the tour operator!
And thank you for last night, it was a great show, but do you promise to keep such strong drama out of the end of shows?
Police watched the hunting in North Karelia and Savoy
The Eastern Finland Police Department conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Center in North Karelia and Upper Sava, the police department's special forces told on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and legality of the hunt.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and the hunting license required on state land.
The authorization to possess hunting weapons and the number of cartridges permitted for hunting rifles were also checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during the surveillance who lacked the required hunting license.
The hunter was fined 12 days for illegal hunting.
In addition, police have blown 133 drivers of vehicles, two of them suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the fine investigation, police times.
In summary, hunters are very good at enforcing hunting licenses.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter noted that "I have hunted in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone had checked the permits".
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor the hunt in the autumn together with other monitoring authorities.
Mykkinen to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees in Turkey
The Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Kai Mykkänen (in his capacity as head of the government), will be travelling to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided to take in 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection visits are usually held twice a year and are attended by representatives from the Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Police.
The delegation is already in Turkey conducting interviews.
The UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, first selects candidates who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly vulnerable position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, the disabled and sick, women and children.
The number of people selected for the group of those coming to Finland is higher than the quota, because in practice some do not arrive for various reasons.
Mykkänen is also meeting with the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs operating on the Syrian border.
The Minister of the Interior, Ilka Salmi, is also on the trip.
The increase in the quota was discussed
Finland has been taking in quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was for a couple of years in 1 050 years, but since then there has been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The House has voted to raise the quota, but the last time the bill was defeated was by the opposition of the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1 500 to 2 000 people per year.
The visit by Mr Mykka is the first visit by the Home Secretary to the country during this government to monitor the selection of the quota refugees.
The previous Ministers of the Interior, Petteri Orpo (pictured) and Paula Risikko (pictured), had time to move on to their new posts before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
We're going to the hills now, we don't know whether to laugh or cry
Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act last Saturday.
The articles implied that the bill would, in principle, prohibit the keeping of any animal for production, as pets or otherwise in connection with business activities, which is not specifically authorized by ministerial decrees.
So everything else is prohibited in principle, except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill is passed, it would mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits actions that threaten the security of society or good manners.
We are now in the process of enacting a general prohibition on all activities not specifically authorized by law or regulation.
The change is that you cannot try anything new, for example, in business, or do anything else until a law or regulation approving it has been passed.
The government's legislative record has generally been weak.
If we now go down the road of saying that everything is prohibited in Finland, except for what is specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to laugh or cry.
I have no doubt that the animal welfare act will require an update.
But this bill is not part of democracy.
I am sorry to say that I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder if it will accept this "everything is prohibited except as specifically permitted by law or regulation" procedure.
I hope there's a sensible minister who will stop this bill from moving forward.
Here 's a tip from Miss Forssell , the four most fashionable towels of the fall .
This fall, the trendy outfit will be snake-lined.
It looks especially good in a skirt.
Combine the snake-shaped skirt with a top-fitting outfit, such as a polo or a regular t-shirt, to maintain a stylish look.
Silk is plentiful this autumn, and the silk dress in particular is one of the season's most fashionable garments.
Combine a gorgeous silk gown with a feminine upper or a relaxed pair of knitwear.
Silk-haired people can play with a little more courage and throw on, for example, sneakers or the trendy fall cowboy boots.
Whether grey, brown or multi-colored, all square skirts are now part of every woman's must-have underwear.
Be bold enough to combine different colors and play with the square box, even with the top of the box.
For example, the combination of the square and the spherical is beautiful.
Asymmetrical pearls are a breath of summer lightness that you can take with you into autumn.
The asymmetrical pearl is at once feminine and playful, and it is a fine choice for both everyday and festive occasions.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, is all black and cute in Jeren's arms
The center of attention in the family portrait of the Karaites is the adorable three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Bay tells the story of the Aito Day Care Centre founded in Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice-hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family addition in early July.
Their firstborn son, Jax, turned two in May, while little Alexia is only three months old.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, where the whole Karalahti family was present.
Nanna posted a picture of the Spanish atmosphere on Instagram, with the whole Karalahti family posing.
The children Jax and Alexia are in the arms of their parents.
The attention is drawn to the sweetly moaning baby Alexia, resting in the arms of Father Jere.
I appreciate this.
Grateful for goodness, forgiveness, generosity and joy, Nanna Karalahti writes a story for a family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, who rose to fame through the Fitness Diaries programme, recently started their daycare business and opened Aito Diary House in Keravalle.
In addition to Karalahti, the company also includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for the education side.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the day-care centre.
In Turkey , people are urged to charge their cell phones in case of a storm .
The storm Zorba, which hit Greece on Saturday, is expected to move into Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday warned sailors, fishermen and farmers, especially on the country's west coast, of a storm in Greece, reports CNN Türk.
A tropical storm is said to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Early Saturday, disaster and emergency officials urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that the Internet is working so that people can receive up-to-date updates, according to the local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been advised to stay indoors and away from windows, and to move things such as garden furniture out of the way of the wind.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey with winds expected to be between 28 and 33 meters per second.
Red weather alert in Greek
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather alert for the southern Greek regions of Attica, Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies in Greece warned Finnish tourists in Greece about the threat of Hurricane Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were advised to follow weather advisories and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago when I contacted you, it was windy and raining.
People were calm, said communications manager Laura Aaltonen from the travel agency Tui on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar to Saturday night.
By evening, the Foreign Ministry had also received no messages from the Finns in distress.
In Greece, several ports were closed to shipping on Saturday, reported the local news agency Amna.
The sea-bound ferry service was cancelled on Saturday, the travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and sea traffic were expected.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather was being actively monitored.
The reason why the Mercedes is so much better than the Ferrari is because of the crystal of the rack.
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen has admitted that the Mercedes, his biggest rival, was too much of a piece for the Russian GP in the time trial.
But there is no need to panic in Ferrari's camp, says an experienced driver.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a huge deal.
Our car was the best in the time trial of the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth time and team mate Sebastian Vettel with Mercedes clearly behind the pace, said Räikkönen.
Ferrari had a tough time in the last race in Singapore.
Raikkonen was asked what caused the sudden fall of Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than us - simple as that.
If I knew why, I'm sure we'd be going at the same pace as them.
But I don't know any more than anybody else.
This is a perpetual guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
There was a rare sensitivity in the team at the time, the future Sauber.
The first season of the Raikkonen, the Ferrari was replaced by Charles Leclerc, who was seventh, and the last time trial was also reached by Marcus Ericsson.
For the Swedish team, the tenth place is the best in more than three years.
And although in the second session, as many as five drivers were completely out of the race, the result was still a sweet one for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging, considering what's in store for the Grim Reaper?
Yeah, compared to where they were in the beginning, that's a big step up.
Next year's gonna be a different story, so we'll see, we'll see.
That was it. Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper with "Robbe is back".
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart was a draw.
The German was a more proactive side in the ring, but he didn't get a good shot.
The clearly larger Helenius controlled the match with his hard-charging lines, which found a good home.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth inning when Helenius knocked Teper out with a left-handed straight.
The impact was so strong that the boxer, fighting in front of his home crowd, didn't even try to get off the mat.
After the victory was assured, Helenius blew a fairly moderate whistle.
In the roundtable, he started by praising the crowd for creating a good mood and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a while.
Thank you to all the viewers and the Finnish cheerleaders.
We were wearing seatbelts today.
Helenius was so happy after the fight.
This was a great victory for the career of Helenius.
"We might even be able to play in a World Cup match", Helenius told Iltalehde before the match.
But a loss could have ended his boxing career.
Of course it's crossed your mind.
You're not getting any younger, Helenius, 34, admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could multiply
The Guardian reports that the country's vice president is urging people to be prepared for a sharp rise in casualties.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla says the death toll could be in the thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are searching for trapped and dead people in the worst-hit areas of Sulawesi Island, the port city of Playa and its neighboring community of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Pal, but the situation with Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are seriously injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palmas has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the screams of people trapped in the rubble, but lack of rescue equipment has delayed rescue efforts.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the military to rescue and clean up.
The army and its equipment are needed because electricity and telecommunications are cut off in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel supplies are running low, too.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitant answer and long reflection caused a laugh
The Miss Finland competition is currently underway in Billnäs Ruuk.
During the challenge tour, each of the Miss Finalists was asked a question.
The finalists asked the question from a glass jar on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six, Emilia Anttikosken, 23,'s hesitant response was met with sweet but kind-hearted laughter from the audience.
The question that was asked to Antti Kosk was sent through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the last book the Miss World finalist read was.
Antti Koski thought about his answer for a long time before hesitating.
Thank you for the question, Grasshopper Ella.
The last book I read is... Anttikoski said to himself.
The pause in reflection caused a roar of laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued his reply:
The last book I read was...
I've read books in school!
I think it's something to do with economics.
So the last book I've read is Economics somebody, Anttikoski answered.
After his answer, Anttikoski received a thunderous applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the Miss World Tour, Anttikoski drew attention because she didn't want to pose in her underwear because of her principles.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9pm, after last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm relinquishes the crown.
♪ Your apple and pear cake ♪ ♪ Will take your tongue when you go ♪
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples on your back, because the domestic apple is on sale at shockingly high prices.
You might have to buy a pear, though I think a lot of people already have a pear tree growing.
This cake can also be made with apples only, if you don't want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more varied if the cake also contains its pear.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seeds.
It was a chip.
You can melt it in the pot.
Scramble the eggs and sugar into a froth, then add the corn flour and melt the butter.
Mix corn starch, or maize, with bread dough and add them to the dough.
Add the almond flour and the wheat flour, mix well.
With baking paper, spread 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread pearly pieces over the sugar.
I'll have half a teaspoon of pear juice on the slices and the apple slices on the teaspoon.
The end of the spoon as a charm on the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is a beautiful brown.
Let it cool in the sink and then roll it over on the side.
Don't cut the cake until it's really cold.
The cake is fragile in structure and easily crushed because the batter contains almond and corn flour, which is gluten-free.
Ruka is hosting an international crime fiction event in January.

According to the festival organisers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide the framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Analyzing the matter, researchers at the University of Sydney have identified two types of "coolness" that have slightly different characteristics: a coolness that is generally attractive and a coolness that is the opposite of it, a coolness that is dissident.
Suddenly, the cool people had many of the traits that researchers described as socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, agreeable, and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by aloofness, independence, rebellion, and resentment.
They were hungry for experience and cared little for outside judgments.
Both types had a strong sense of self and a stable emotional life.
The role of the hard man is no longer cool: high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 U.S. study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who dated early, hooked up, joined good-looking groups, and sought the approval of others were at greater risk of becoming addicted to drugs and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared less well than their more inconspicuous contemporaries.
High-status locked cars, branded locks or watches do not make a person cool - or at least a genuinely attractive companion.
In a study published in the August issue of Social Psychological and Personality Science, the majority of people were more willing to make friends with those wearing their regular store shirt than with those wearing their shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a shirt when they were getting to know each other.
If you're on a vacation in the Greek islands, beware!
There 's a storm brewing . The weatherman 's warning is in red .
During the weekend, southern Greece can receive as much rain as Finland receives in half a year on average.
The Zorbas-hirmumyrsky will hit Greece this weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
The Greeks have issued a red weather alert for the region.
The forecast of the storm is also reported on the Foreca blog.
It says that the storm's strongest blasts are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the storm that swept through Finland earlier this week, Hurricane Kuisma, at its peak, blew at over 100 feet per second.
According to the blog, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rainfall.
By the end of the week, more than 300 millimeters of rain can fall in southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
Hurricane Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the Love Island Finland Duck, the man's drool?
Appears in confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that in the series Love Island Finland, the beauty Anku, who was killed by several men, also appears as a scarecrow in strange YouTube videos published in 2010.
In the video, Anku instructs fishermen, among other things, to make a mustard from an old roll of household paper.
The duck also shows in his sympathetic style how from his tights you can carve a silica that grows real spikes.
Now, we're going to grow the Easter vegetables, but we're going to do it in a way that's a little surprising, and Duck is going to hint and introduce the sawdust, the stockings, and the radish seeds that he's going to make into the silk.
You can watch the videos below or on the YouTube channel of Anku here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and adrenaline-filled at Sotsh, and he's gonna be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was shaking for another ten minutes after his goal at the Russian GP, when he was in front of the media.
A great lap left behind Mercedes' number one Lewis Hamilton and was certainly a critical psychological one for the Finnish rider who had been in this season.
Have a nice ride.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he skipped the settlement round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little, Bottas made it.
I've only been to the gallows once this year, in Austria (central), so time has passed pretty quickly.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I've gotten good laps again.
The Sochi circuit is not easy to pass, so the starting line is particularly big.
And of course, Bottas was asked if he'd be driving for the win tomorrow or if he'd be driving for the World Championship, with Hamilton closing in on the title.
My starting point in racing is definitely to try to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the pole, Bottas did.
But as a team, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis's lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big, and the gap to me is pretty big, so that's something to keep in mind.
We'll see what happens, but Bottas's done it.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of the Bottas after the race, and Mercedes's head of works, Toto Wolff, was also pleased.
Lewis had every intention of beating Valtteri, but he failed to do so in the morning.
Valtteri knows he's gonna have to rip everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged up, the adrenaline was pouring out of his ears, Wolff was glowing.
When asked if the team would allow Bottas and Hamilton to run straight, Wolff responded with a backhanded, "No".
We'll talk tomorrow morning, see how the race goes.
The Finnish rally champion Erno Kinnunen from Kiel
The Rally Car SM series ended in a rare way.
It's hardly ever been the case that the brothers have become Finnish champions at the same time.
This time it was the final rally in the Turku and Salonen area, where the two Tuusimaa players Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen won the SM1 and SM2 classes.
The Kitesure Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheelers.
Kinnunen, competing on the Honda Civic, and mapmaker Ville Mäkelä started off the race in Turku with a sense of humour, because the starting points were clear: a place in the top team would guarantee the SM title.
Friday night, in the dark, the two had to give a leveling call when some of the lights failed in a second special test.
That's a pretty blind shot for the third one.
You don't want to be a jerk in a situation like this.
On Saturday, the pace of Jussi Tepo was followed only in the second series, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands the US, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria to fight terrorism, and that the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But there is no end in sight to the seven-year war.
The war has killed over 360,000 people.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Germany on Friday that a meeting on Syria is planned for October, with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey in addition to her.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court drama on television.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment, brought an unprecedented number of people to the podium.
The Supreme Court Justice nomination drama in full swing in the United States had at least 20 million people watching on their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Donald Trump's nominee Kavanaugh and California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee telling their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearing was followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on the six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
To add to their online audience, several million more followed.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed the live stream, and CNN reported that it had set a record for the year with 8.2 million live streams in its first week.
That's over 10 million when you count the number of people who watched the show on YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made it to 8.0 million in its launch.
The digital start-ups are the channels' own, the TV viewer counts are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final numbers on Monday, but they're still a bummer.
It 's hardly 20 million .
The 20 million-plus viewership in the United States is typically limited to sports events, the entertainment world's major Oscars and Grammys, and occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
The most-watched program in America, the NFL playoffs, the Super Bowl, is a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl drew an estimated 103 million people to the NBC side of the stage.
Last year, nearly 48 million people watched Trump's first address to Congress, and a whopping 30 million watched the inauguration, according to Nielsen.
The Most Important Issue
The appointment of a justice to the Supreme Court is an extremely significant event in the United States, because the office is for life.
Trump had already appointed one new justice when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and Republicans succeeded in preventing then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor.
The second seat opened when Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on many issues he was the so-called balance of power whose vote might decide the position of the nine-member court.
She was a supporter of abortion rights and sexual minority rights and voted in 2015 to give same-sex couples the right to marry across the country.
Kavanaugh is a lot more conservative than that.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock the court into a conservative power for decades.
Children have the right to know what their parents are doing
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children's health records in the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
Of course, the situation at the Kanta Service was even more worrisome: parents were not even allowed to see the health records or prescriptions of the infants.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the Commission has taken into account the findings of the investigation.
Since then, promises have been made to correct the practices, but it has taken a surprisingly long time to do so.
Now, the fix is in.
Because the problem is clear, changing the legal framework should have been nothing more than a shout-out.
Then, in layman's terms, it's a matter of pressing a button: now, when the string is held, it opens.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents their information... if he or she has a bank account number or an official ID.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
I.D. is a fee, and a 10-year-old can't even get a bank account.
So, in practice, no one can see the data of a fourth-grader in elementary school except by asking for it to be printed.
It's not so much about the rights of the parents as it is about the rights of the children.
Parental involvement is of the utmost importance in child care.
The right of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be protected.
Even minors may have family situations where not all matters can be discussed freely.
Often they are related to sexual health, the free provision of which is a profoundly important human right.
In the United States, the FBI began dropping the harassment charges against Kavanaugh.
US media reports say the FBI is investigating harassment allegations made by at least two women.
One of the women was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual harassment during his college years.
President Donald Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
I can't let this thing go on for more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, the investigation is a narrow-and-close criminal investigation, and it may not be public.
A man threatened to kill police officers at a police station in Kajaan
The arrested troublemaker continued to be a bully even in the cell.
Police say they've put the man in police custody to "calm down".
Police were targeted by a suspected assailant last Saturday night in Kajaani.
Authorities are reporting an incident that began when a man in his 30s engaged in a violent altercation at a downtown restaurant.
First, the man assaulted another customer inside the grocery store.
This led to his removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a wrestler attacked another man, knocking him to the ground.
When a third party tried to intervene, he hit her, too.
The three-way hold was the trigger for the police.
The patrol picked up the man and took Kajan to the police station, the police said.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault police officers.
Police say they took the man to the police station to "calm down".
The man is suspected of three counts of assault and resisting a law enforcement officer.
Aid agencies prepare to begin work on Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
The UN children's agency Unicef and other international aid agencies are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says UNICEF Finland's head of information Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are leading the rescue efforts, but the need for additional assistance is evident at this point.
UNICEF is active in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has a full emergency response system, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and dead.
Rescue efforts are underway in the town of Sulawesi, but the situation is less clear in the Donggala area, a little further north.
There are still places where the lines are not working.
Aid is difficult because roads are also closed, says Haru.
The buildings at Sulawesi are often lightly constructed, so the damage from the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors are found, they will need shelter - tenting, for example, at first - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent thing in a crisis.
First, most people can be provided with water purification tablets, which Unicef also has in stock.
The water systems are repaired as soon as possible, but in case of emergency, water is transported, for example, by rafts.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and bringing families together is one of UNICEF's missions.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), part of the United Nations.
The initial phase of the emergency aid will be financed from previously collected funds.
However, UNICEF and others have already started to raise money to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk is stepping down as chairman of Tesla's board of directors after being fined $20 million for tweeting
Elon Musk, founder of the companies that make space rockets and electric cars, is avoiding fraud charges by signing a deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk is stepping down as chairman of the board of Tesla, the electric car company, and is agreeing to a $20 million fine.
Musk is stepping down as part of a deal he's made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By agreeing to Musk, you'll avoid the fraud charges.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) threatened Musk for securities fraud over tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to take the electric car company Tesla out of the stock market, which caused the company's stock price to rise rapidly.
The agreement also barred Musk from serving as chairman of Tesla's board of directors for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new 'independent member' to its board of directors and take two 'independent directors' to its executive committee.
Tesla also has to set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk will still be allowed to remain as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fine, Tesla Inc. will also be required to pay a $20 million fine to the IRS.
The tweets were misleading investors.
The SEC said Musk's tweets were misleading to investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the funding to buy Tesla back from the stock market as a private equity company.
Billionaire's tweets suggested the company was being bought off the market for $420 a share.
Tesla's stock price rose more than 10% in the 24 hours after the tweets, but then fell.
The SEC said that Musk's allegations were completely unsubstantiated.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the financing he claimed.
Nor had he discussed withdrawal from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the board of the company.
On Friday this week, the stock price fell 14 percent after the SEC announced a fraud charge.
The new agreement is expected to strengthen the company's position once again.
The last sentence is not the reason.
Of course, the church bells don't ring when the flags aren't moving.
It's a technical glitch.
The clock on the tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The hands are pointing to 12:00.
It's like a normal horror movie, except the crypt of the church is full of voices and the nuns are singing their own songs.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken down.
It has been repaired, but some parts are broken and a new part is needed, says the nurse, Eveliina Jamsen.
Sam Jamallasen confirms the fact that the Church in Helsinki has a Twitter account.
Because the account says that the last judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
James says the church bells are not ringing because of a malfunction.
