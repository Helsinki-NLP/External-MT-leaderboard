Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth US president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of 1.4 million dollars will be awarded to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, although the third to receive it in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will be talking about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war with two countries.
Their war efforts were further increased with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of their critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
The proposal is to donate paraffins to charity, but it has not yet decided which specific organisation to donate them to.
During its entire programme, the President and his wife will attend a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the award.
He mentioned, for example, having a feeling of not being worth it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Litoměřice Society of Nature Defenders) of blackmail.
Last year, she appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw appeals demanded money from investors for her own benefit, Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The President of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Defenders is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in state custody and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate garbage.
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia containers can be found to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
They need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno trash is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, for the second largest city in the Republic, the town councils are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of waste, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever, for example, tried to throw a PET bottle into the center of the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially if it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is Moravské náměstí square, across from Potrefená Huse.
I don't want Mr. Onderka and his associates to be mad at me, but that seems too little.
Needless to say, elsewhere it is not easy to separate garbage either.
That's why a lot of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By vacation
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered to throw away several glass and plastic bottles after a party.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram, I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already pouring out of the container.
It is still the centre of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics don't seem to interest Brno socialists too much.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extra league, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad I can compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst of the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
The budget of Paroubek has removed money from the income and sickness allowances
After the left, despite the government's opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rent, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt nor international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who is in power in the second half of next year, says Treasury Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they were confident that the government would ask for a loan for sensible expenditure, income or sickness subsidies.
The thing is, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, someday, you have to pay the money back.
The state doesn't have many options for getting money.
If you do not reduce social subsidies or government operating expenses, you have to increase taxes.
To everyone left-wing now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, her children too.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness benefits, they'll get it.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year there will be not only 163.000 million short in the treasury, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity subsidies, as the government did in its deficit package.
Because of the dislocation of money to benefit some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion short to finish the construction of motorways and railways.
These are, above all, sectors where the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their prices cannot be reduced.
The best you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
This means delay or halting of the 30 major projects; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, warns the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Salomonic solution for the decrease in funds: it would obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly state-owned, and would add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never secure and it's a bottomless sack.
Last year, the Czech Republic allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year the dividends are settled for environmental damage, used to complete the income account or used as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to provide various compensation to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is not clear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, take over the government budget reserve.
The Commission has already launched the Státní pokladna (State Fund) project, which has already started, and is currently running at a cost of two billion.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to run on two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone where the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just a single push of a key, you're moving from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
This possibility is precisely the goal of the US company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of computer virtualization software.
You can have two user profiles on your mobile at once.
They can switch between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate simultaneously, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and several days ago it was first demonstrated.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully shown journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hotel owners
Not only telescope keepers in Krkonoše are concerned about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski accommodations in hotels and boarding houses.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether there will be snow or mud this Christmas", said the keeper of the news portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend an old-time night in Špindlerův Mlýn as expected should not hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put quality of accommodation second to nothing can try to wait a few more days.
The hotels in Špindlerův Mlýn offer mostly weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll keep offering them, but they'll soon give up and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell out quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered are still open.
That is why we have already prepared some last minute holiday accommodations", said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer the Krkonoše New Year's Eve, but there are fewer seats available.
The first fourteen days of February are also selling very well, the remaining winter dates are regularly sold.
This year, interest in wintering is undermined by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks remain snow-covered during the week, Christmas dates will run out too", says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last seats available.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sell well", said Karel Rada, the director of the best hotel in Pec.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja's rooms are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at the newest hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds are still available.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are at about 60 percent occupancy.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as the snow falls, interest in Krkonoše stays will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the manager of Omnia Hotel.
However, it seems that for now the hotel owners in Krkonoše will be overwhelmed by the need to wait for snow.
On Thursday, the temperatures should drop and, if there is rain, in the mountains should snow.
But then temperatures will rise again, said Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the most stupid, on the Afghan issue.
When he finally revealed his long-awaited Afghan approach, it turned out to be a copy of the script Bush used for Iraq, created three years ago.
Not only is the same text repeatedly used in the phrase "just like Iraq", but he also hesitated to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new road forward".
It was he himself who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and criticized it as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, proved that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is no mention of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but he objectively left his successor with a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to repeat itself.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander in chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he fooled the general about 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, starting withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finishing this process in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is being fulfilled.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the head every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated because of the confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shattered by his volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon", will perform some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will view it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the successful withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive thing for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election and that there is still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if this proves a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
The top executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest road ahead, said former investment banker at JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has faced criticism for having set aside nearly $17 billion (almost $300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the institution for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to levy a one-off, fifty-percent tax, bonus for bankers over 25,000 pounds (about 712 000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record number, received this year's Nobel Prizes in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, a Romanian-born German writer, Herta Müller, was among the winners.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for his research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for their explanation of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was given to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a female award winner, was Physics.
This award was given today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and telescopes.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
If there are several winners in each category, the prize is shared amongst each other.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and also heads a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defending his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation.
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the minister of finance Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he is not in agreement with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the chamber of deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also the residence of Janota in the cabinet, are supposed to be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also being criticized by Klaus.
He said the deficit was too large, which further deepened the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by the spokesman of the President Radim Ochvat.
On her stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, prepared for Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved the left's proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for officials' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they are covertly increasing the budget deficit.
The political situation in the country was very different from that in the previous years, and the political situation was very different from that in the past.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the austerity package imposed in the fall by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long ignored "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
He says they don't have a good solution anymore.
Only a strong government, which can rely on a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
The SDG leader Mirek Topolanek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
The deputy chairman of the SDG, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, the SDG and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences".
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolanek by saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolanek.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular were happy too.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the lead roles are played by American actors.
History is about sports, racial relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When you interpret, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing, Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the abolitionist movement, who ended up as a slave, the fictional president of the United States, and even God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely portrayed someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became the country's president.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation is still racially and economically divided.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, and that's why he decides to unite rugby players, who are world-class outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to theaters.
I had no other goal than to play this role in a way that was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was speaking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
Most importantly, I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that when I shake his hand, I get his energy, it's transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try and become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby union team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough rugby world.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much taller".
Despite the obvious differences between the actors' characters and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talked about Oscar ambitions.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety magazine summed up his assessment with the words: "It was a very good story, a very well made movie".
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received a 76 percent positive rating.
The secret of the splendor over Norway solved: Russians tested a missile
A special lighting effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense ended up acknowledging yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The "Bulava" missile, formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence at missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, didn't fly out or there was an air failure.
Russian newspapers write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but it shines.
During this 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows launch from a moving and submerged vessel at the same time.
So it's likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The Norwegians, too, from the very beginning didn't hesitate to think it was a Russian missile.
The generals defended themselves this time by saying that failure cannot be simply spoken of.
The first two stages of the missile lasted and the failure occurred on the third.
In the previous cases the engines were immediately damaged at the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defense management only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost fifty percent is full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to assert that "Bulavá" will one day fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years old
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will once again be appearing at the age of 51 at a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play Friday in the KHL's duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is a constant practitioner and has committed to helping the team.
We just have to sort out some formal issues, the AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It's still unclear whether the return of the famous player will be a one-off match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-tenured professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the five famous players, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second half of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has met the union requirements.
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent overtime, the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions for another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign our manufacturing plan, as it is essential, so we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday 19 December, that is, it will be done in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivated its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can claim the bonus for overtime or take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend the holiday holidays in one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift workers will receive money for travel and food.
Since the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints from unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, management yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all supplementary work for December, Vaněk said.
The workers of the car factory were forced to work two hours more in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation continued almost every day until last week.
After the agreement is signed, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and the document was signed, they were ready to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over frequent overtime jobs.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the emergency strike on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, who on Wednesday stopped manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As regards supplementary work, the unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a salary of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The series production was started last November.
As of last September it had produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: an effective substance even in 'crossroads' HIV viruses
Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus as some medicines already available.
AIDS is not curable until now.
However, patients' lives can be significantly extended by a combination of medicines that prevent HIV from replicating in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallic carbohydrates have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of HIV.
Metalocarbons are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that is different from all medicines used today, and so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, improved compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus' albumin.
Metal carbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it's essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no HIV fractionation and no mature and infectious virus bodies would be created.
If we stop HIV proteasis, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
Testing of the effect of this series of substances on HIV proteases was carried out on probeta, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The unique mechanism of effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications make metallocarbons interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective HIV medicines, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
The SDG attacked Fischer, he defends himself.
The head of the SDG Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "awful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, he said, think about its future existence.
The SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time for analysis.
The deputy chairman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to support the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to stay in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of the SDGs and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives increased money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has condemned the SDG proposals, as they cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS before the vote left the House and thus fulfilled the government's wish that the amended budget be better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and Uselessness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out, that he's thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with the nominees of the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make clear whether he will resign if the House passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness subsidies, pensions or the amendment to the service law.
Topolanek: The ministers appointed by the SDGs are not to blame
It's the Prime Minister Fischer's business and the whole government's.
The ministers appointed by the SDGs have done nothing wrong, Topolanek stressed in the US news.
He recalled that in various ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the fight against the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is based on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to rely on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about it, but when the time comes, I will deal with it, said Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the SDG.
Prime Minister Fischer left for a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
The SDG gave in at the Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed that ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask ODS deputies to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel orphaned, we are not small children, he reacted to the question, if the SDG is not concerned about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned, he knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevisation of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of ČD, fewer trains will run at almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) will cancel or restrict some less used local and high-speed trains from 13 December and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into force.
Most fares including the basic and customer price will not change.
More links to the capital will be gained, for example, by the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, whereby a pendulum roadway will be added to this line.
The direct train, on the other hand, will no longer run to Bratislava.
The Prague-Písek-České Budějovice line will be served by fewer high-speed trains and the direct Prague-Letohrad links will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent overall, whereas transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and some high-speed trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, and its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the Lysá nad Labem to Milovice line.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Hlavní nádraží station in Prague.
ČD will introduce further SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
From 13 December onwards, travellers will no longer travel to Bratislava on Pendolino.
Regional railway accounts this year: 200 million more than before
The high-speed trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, just like this year.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
For high-speed trains and local dráhy have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always one-year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't raise the prices of a vast majority of the bills.
The changes will only be made on one-day banknotes - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet banknotes.
For travellers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was a single price of 160 krona for travel between any two regional cities.
Filipino armed forces continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
Armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by AFP, which previously reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The abduction took place in the southern province of Agusan.
They say about 19 armed men use the hostages as a live shield in the police escape.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police previously pursued the kidnappers because of violence, which was caused by the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law is imposed because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 assassination, related to the governor's election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the killing, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists also operate.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of RSA is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures a part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela, is being released in American cinemas.
The world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the lead role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
The premiere is the result of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, together with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The Commission has also been able to draw up a report on the situation in South Africa, which is a major cause of concern for the public, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film at RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the lead roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however says, he's proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as they say - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the Los Angeles festival premiere.
I think it's good if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it is about the whole world, he added.
In the national rugby team suit
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays the lead role in the South African national rugby team suit and enters the playing field.
For entering the grill in the suit, which in the RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great applause, especially from the white public and the recognition of white residents.
The football championship may help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans are skeptical, as said for example in a recent interview for LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns is burning
The fire caught a Čeps transformer in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lounsko in the morning.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the firefighters' spokesman for the Ústí region, the fire is being extinguished by six groups.
Firefighters had previously wanted the transformer destroyed by fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokeswoman, the failure does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, and it will not be possible to list it exactly until the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing similar happened, such breakdowns are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, ČEZ's spokeswoman for the Northern Czech Republic, electricity supplies were not cut off and the fire at the power substation did not affect the operation of households, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps půs operated in the Czech Republic as sole operator of the distribution system, the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 switching boxes with 67 transformers, which carry electrical energy from the transmission system to the distributor system, and maintains 4339 kilometres of electrical conduction.
Jančura will file a libel complaint against three members of the ČSSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura is today filing a libel complaint against three social democratic hetman.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the measures taken are not distorted.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty minutes on Radiožurnál.
The demand is related to the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three Hetmen are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake", yet we only brought the offer for what they wanted.
We know the prices of České dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left to defend ourselves.
It's because of the slander against the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also mentioned that the evidence was available from all regions and that the necessary measures were not taken in line with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint to be a continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and himself.
I am naturally prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I call on the other Hetman to do the same.
I think it will be clear again this time that Mr Jančura manipulates the public on the regional rail transport issue and uses false and false arguments, Mr Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, with the aim of warning the regions of these measures.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura launched the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion kroner they did not call a tender.
Mr Jančura said that similar steps were in conflict with the law and the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of the ČSSD, because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He was a member of the Czech Social Democratic Party, I know, what a gentleman he is, I will not say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will end the usual habits.
As the first vaccine, it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the compulsory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are coming to a close.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting maximum vaccine prices, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts are already clear about this in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born after 2 August of last year can receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not to have received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily let their children get the pneumococcal vaccine.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Generally, experts estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually on vaccines.
They'll save money on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all the children's vaccinations.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
From pneumococcal infections in our country every year, according to research in hospitals 28 children under the age of 10 die.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumocal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, there are also opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The compulsory vaccination would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský, head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association took part, were not entirely satisfied that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we must now take, Kalovský said.
The Ministry of Health however does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococcal diseases.
We are not thinking about it at all at this time, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks, doctors say
The president of the Society of Paediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children were to receive the vaccine, it would be possible to reason about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a voluntary one", says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from next year onward, more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies get the pneumococcal vaccine.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change, too, because as the first vaccination in children, it's covered by healthcare companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save money on treatment later on, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs were, however, afraid that insurance companies could "take the money out of health insurance".
That's why doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they're paid by the insurance companies.
It's estimated that pediatricians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "a museum robbery"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught carrying 90 paintings in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim Frazetta and another man used a digger to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, stated to the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a depot".
The agency said Frazetta's father denied granting such permission.
Labour supports tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling "waste" an opportunity to show his seriousness about deficit cuts, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Finance Minister also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5 percent increase in Social Security expenditure and a 1 percent cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Anger at Social Security
Trade unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems".
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by about three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which says this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
Key points of the previous information
Social security with an additional increase of 0,5%, from April 2011
The economy will shrink by 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bank bonds
The 1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms was excluded
Tax deductions for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%.
According to estimates from the Treasury, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 a year and a person earning £40,000 will lose £190, while a person earning £10,000 a year will gain £110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60 percent of the additional tax burden would fall on the top 5 percent of wages.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and spending cuts outlined were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures, and it will allow us to cut the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced, have been called into question after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely shrink by 4.75 per cent this year, much worse than the 3.5 per cent decline forecast in April, while the demand for loans would be £3 billion above the previous estimate.
"Wasted opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party's "debt crisis", said the projected £789 billion loan application for the next six years was unsustainable.
The ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cynically" dodging the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do", said the Minister in the shadow of the Treasury, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it".
All the important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte and other companies
Labour insists schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction of the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sand castles".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing chosen for the announcements, such as the uptick in inflation of some disability subsidies from next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to accusations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that the people who need it most are being provided and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said the figures of the Finance Minister involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defense.
"This is really putting off the pain for later", said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins wins", added Roger Bootle, Deloitte's accounting economics consultant.
"This has been the false pre-budget report.
FBI investigates "American detentions in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are reportedly of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are U.S. citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges they have been arrested for and under what circumstances they are being held", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing", the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said the house was already under the watch of local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported; but said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "models of abuse" by the regime, before and after the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticism has a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election result.
"They often hit me in the face", according to her words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-telection unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confused and the parliamentary committee's inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
There was a ski slope in the city park.
Over 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a racetrack.
The track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was pretty scary.
You can see a beautiful view of the city lights ticking below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent", he added.
Awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After Thursday afternoon's event, the snow will melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on minarets and a widespread alarm about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work Why the French Don't Like Headcarves (2006), an elegant and detailed, argued study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims of France with what Mr. Bowen calls Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political drama.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim academic and scholar.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They can't get this argument out there completely.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than increasing pragmatism, it perceives a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say yes, but not yet".
The world's most desolate landscape
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In On Thin Ice, Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
A knowledgeable of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave proof of courage by confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the tip of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught swimming after the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, it exhibited 75 polar bears at a time.
Even today, zoos are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult's range. The climate is almost never right: a polar bear resident in Singapore grew green because of the algae growing inside the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobile Eskimos use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down prey.
Ironically, it's in the waters north of those two hunter nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear, chilling account of Arctic science and a startling look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not for lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines mapped the moving ice strings that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful addition, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the system that flows into the Arctic ice, formed by jets of salt water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they're all doomed once summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington's graves
P.F. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours on a bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we're being boarded, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on the graves of veterans in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is now an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has expanded the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the Arlington Cemetery graves, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late career military man.
As long as her husband isn't buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving a retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way for civilians to support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers went to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because they don't get as many visitors as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, carrying the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the icy air.
Some read out names carved into the stones, while others leaned to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunner David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after I'm dead, I want someone to remember it".
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything considered "dangerous".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protest and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor could likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-range" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program for the Americas at Human Rights Watch, which recently published a tough report on liberties in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba itself", a reference to Raúl Castro's position as the country's leader, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, tried and jailed in one day.
He said any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brains of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hope the case could help untangle an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who roam the Internet looking for radicalised youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving of terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, speaking anonymously due to the delicate nature of the case.
The official said the men were not mutated and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determining who they can trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made trying to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda a top priority.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies, pass.
Analysts said al Qaeda is looking very closely at aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization, they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to access American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit to, because US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model that many have already followed?
It's become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center take bolder action on climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people attended the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding banners in English that said, "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that said, "The Earth says, "enough is enough".
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother's homeland, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with because of the impacts of climate change that are already happening".
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to come up with a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the main canal in Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I wasn't really aware of the situation".
Then he continued in Mandarin, "Because the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He said it was up to each person's perspective to determine whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
Moreover, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
Last week's federal grade book on math performance was very good news for the Capital District public schools.
Although the District is still far from the country's best performing systems, the grade book showed that fourth- and eighth-grade students have been striding at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what's recorded in the recent figures from the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
Average scores for white fourth graders in D.C. over the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased just three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, falling a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-grade students in 2003, when the first EIPE was introduced in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has narrowly narrowed to 58.
Some district education lawyers expressed concern last week, as the progress made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), was largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole thing by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I'm not jumping for a two- or three-point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Demo-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
Brown, an outspoken critic of Rhee's management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city's high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly, you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what worries us is that we're not devoting the time or energy needed to our middle schools.
Rhee said the district needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper-middle- and primary school students who have not mastered the basics of early reading in their school curricula and are considerably behind their peers.
Daily math, a curriculum of math from kindergarten through sixth grade, emphasizing real-life games and experiences, that was introduced into the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to reduce the gap.
Here's a sort of a tricky dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution to conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
The objective can then generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on making sure we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to ending the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with independent schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which she considers an "indicator" to seek a bigger increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong resolution.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, went down and blinked for a moment before the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had just graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic prospective students.
Yes! Here I am! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Man, seriously? he said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the low teacher-student ratio of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the kids had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is which.
While there is growing concern about the large number of Hispanic immigrant children born in the United States who drop out of high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting college education that they need to get into the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexican and Central American, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point to the path forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze the most successful say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents lack the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these kids, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour through Graciela's universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run college prep programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in restoring Iraq's decades-long war and sanctions-torn oil industry.
American companies have moved away having only jumped on two of the 10 auctioned sites.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two American companies reached deals for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of the US oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the forefront, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and political instability as the US military retreats, likely prevented US oil companies from taking more risks in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest oil reserves, analysts said.
American companies were at a disadvantage in some cases, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have strained ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and provided technical advice in recent years, have walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned National Petroleum Corporation of China offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Assam Oil Ministry Jihad.
We have confidence that the Chinese company will be on top of its competitors and will deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each site.
Al Qaeda's top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged US missile strike on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a senior al Qaeda operational planner this week, US counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified plane, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading for the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior al Qaeda military planner, who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was engaged in conspiracy around the world, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the delicate nature of US airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide from al Qaeda's top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a familiar name to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of unmanned aircraft attacks led by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to an account in The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
UN High Representative in Kabul about to resign
The UN's top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was marred by widespread corruption allegations in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase, but was concerned that the US military withdrawal schedule starting in 18 months would prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who are collaborating with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said she was not resigning, but simply keeping a promise she made to her family in March 2008, to spend just two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun to look for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test by his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said Galbraith's allegations, who was fired, "certainly hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, lending themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations to her powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the UN's cumbersome hiring regulations were undermining her ability to capture talent.
That's how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for its failure to engage in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, understated the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we've learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the general Iranian population.
He said it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be actually less safe with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran would face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program did not fully comply with the directions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and would agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided over the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's tightening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they haven't been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline of December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including continuing with what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions".
In a statement in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless and baseless accusations" on Thursday by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, saying it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to get an appropriate, long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them".
In an ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "an extra baby means another grave".
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We've already given all our time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously clumsy, ill-treated, one-child children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen by 1.8 children per couple, compared with six when the policy became effective, according to the Division of
UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Family Planning and Population Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate future labour shortages".
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden", he said.
Gradual relief
Drafted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions based on the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they tempered many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at Peking University, said that central government officials have been debating even more radical changes recently, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night, posters ordering families to have only one child were replaced with copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very unobtrusive.
Disappointing Answer
Although officials in a rural city outside Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban districts show no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications a month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still forecast to reach only around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Caolu Municipality in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West misunderstand the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yeah, they're stealing the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political one.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the HR manager, said she wants an only child because she was too: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to taking care of others and we really don't want to take care of others".
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation agency, explained this more forcefully.
For parents with two careers, middle-class, that reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he argued.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "you have to remodel your apartment", and the strategist "you have to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycare when the child is 9 months old".
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized by so far-reaching defiant stances and mutual recriminations, drew renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that predicts ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying the bulk of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not mention how much money rich countries would give to the poor to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for the key questions, including how the developed and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that policy makers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture".
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred the talks on Friday, pledging $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the conversation last week.
The US special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims that they call for mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not financed by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make a deal without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing off over their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the world's 24 most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it's not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the talks will yield at most a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process", in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government can come to a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese deputy minister, got off the planes and ran into the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The total disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists present night shows mocking countries they say are selling, and preliminary proposals are passed hand in hand instead of by mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We're entering the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global conservation policy.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first 225 km/h train from Britain redefines that feeling of Monday.
At 5.13am on Monday, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like a lightning bolt from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first Javelin interurban service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major Midlands, North and Scottish conurbations to London.
Neglected secluded areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and switching planes and cars to rail would reduce national coal emissions, as well as alleviate road congestion.
In theory, the three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage, can still slow Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25 metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One line would go into Scotland.
It seems this will be the most beneficial option", said a member of the railway.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to the current one hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains of 400 metres in length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
In view of the capital's space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston stations offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a wide public consultation and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the expressways on existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a benchmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face a mortgage for a £75,000 orange from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his constituency house.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived on 'rations,' increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding up to hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications in due course and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members' expenditure.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses nearby have sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange".
The neighbors described it as a 'greenhouse for entertainment.'"
Mr Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase during a recent inquiry by the House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee acquitted him of violating the rules after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a £271,406 mortgage from his London estate to the house in his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming approximately £1,400 a month in mortgage interest up to March last year.
In April, their applications increased to over £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the £75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE decreased from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the current rate.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to request £1,250 a month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as opposition chairman of the House in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "from rations" after the spending scandal.
"It's basically nationalized, you have to live off rations and be treated like a bitch".
He said: I spend my money on my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I don't".
The deputy, a millionaire by his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the pay office that this could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole shaped like the pound sterling symbol in Mr Duncan's lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds over three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved by both the Wage Office and subsequently by Legg".
He added: It's not about dodging and breaking or breaking the rules or anything.
This is absolutely within the bounds, by the rules, authorized and all.
It could not be any clearer or simpler".
Come, you who have faith, to see the calendar of the advent of the Brighton Beach Palapa
Brighton's palpables have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using Christmas carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests able to see the latest palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with refilled pastries and ponche served free.
The Christmas carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman in the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society".
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to an old strange building?
The idea of the calendar for the Advent of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we're trying to prove and represent that through spirituality".
Mass climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday demanding an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police, and hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the icy Danish capital demanding an agreement that the United Nations Climate Change Conference should reach by Friday, which would take effect on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chair of the Climate Conference, the growing global climate mobilization represented by these demonstrations contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to them, especially members of the Black Blocs, a small ultra-violent group that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sitting despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took off towards the Bella Center, the venue of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers.The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present along with some Africans.
Some 3,000 people, mostly with sky shovels, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: there is time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, waterways that you can walk through like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of the anti-globalization movement, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia Pacific region, which includes numerous islands that are very vulnerable to warming, has given the initial kick-off to the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, marched in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as in Canada, hundreds of demonstrators gathered to demand vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
Abkhazia, a pro-Georgian separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected its president on Saturday; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, turnout was 58% a few hours before closing.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing President Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the vote scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation", said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this 216,000-inhabitant territory, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said 54-year-old historian Svetlana Kvartchia, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees in the entrance.
The subject of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different locations in this small 216,000-strong territory.
In Gali, in the west of the country, district head Beslan Archba warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to monitor the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow for its support, and very particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Russian parliamentarian Alexei Ostrovski answered, raising his glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year as one that cedes control of the steep railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets around the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around a massive demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to police, and hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched in the afternoon amid the chill of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took off towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers.The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and steadfastly intervened, throwing several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", a small group of ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a brick, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, police said.
We are not keeping an eye on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as police helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Some 3,000 people, mostly with sky shovels, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam, together with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which includes numerous islands that are very vulnerable to warming, has given the initial kick-off to the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar power in front of the City Hall in the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters were formed to demand action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The history and geography subject is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview to be broadcast in the Sunday Informatif (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" by the reform of general secondary education, despite being removed from compulsory education in the second year of a scientific bachelor's degree.
From now on, all students in the first year of bachelor's will have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "hypocrisy is enough" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it calls on the best students".
The General and Literary Education branches cannot be sub-branches of the C, he continues to stress: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged that they had eliminated history and geography secondary to bachelor's degrees in technological schools".
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography secondary education from undergraduate level C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "no talk is made" of eliminating philosophy from the secondary C bachelor's program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will aim for their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also be practicing under real conditions during the M2 year, after which they will be a first year in front of the classroom as practising teachers.
If you do all the pre-contest practical proposals, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
In the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Normal School, accepted Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the "Ernest" conference round, a day of fifteen-minute, filmed and open to the public, expert presentations, AFP reported.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and convey to them the desire to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of the day, as the students baptized the fish in the school pond.
We selected about 20 participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, who presented without notes but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record".
The videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" is planned for February, followed by two more in a bimonthly fashion.
Late payment: displeasure among prison guards, action is expected
Prison guards' unions called for a "general mobilization" on Friday to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until next week for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers' Force (second union of guards) asked the off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization", as it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the non-compliance with the payment in December of the "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guards' union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards' unions assuring them that payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I have asked the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who benefit from the famous functions and objectives premiums, and who "always blame budgetary demands", Ufap/Unsa lamented.
It is a real scandal, said indignantly the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and the corresponding holidays if the October ones are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
In a time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking on more effectiveness, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salaries of staff, estimates the CGT prison in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But the outcome is not what was expected, said the Ufap Secretary-General, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television host, Oprah Winfrey, that he came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I get".
During a special interview broadcast Sunday night by ABC, the president and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the New Year's Eve parties at their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be out of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will receive a gift "of course", according to excerpts from the program aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she received: "By no means did I make you beautiful gifts last year", she said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding humorously pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace, "Who gave you that?"
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous animator who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bicycle, as well as a basketball that his father, a Kenyan who saw it rarely, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time my dad came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of putting it around the house, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was interviewed again in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was put into an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was interviewed again Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "lesion derived from the operation" of herniated disc performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city said, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey calm by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be put into an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about his condition, RTL adds.
The press service, interviewed by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that 'according to some sources' no cannula had been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had undergone surgery at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted Monday to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection stemming from Delajoux's surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured that it was not "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before he traveled to L.A., and I told him it was silly to do 12 hours of flying after such an operation, not possible, Eddy Mitchell declared.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure by stating that Johnny Hallyday, "reacts satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection is "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on for a "colon cancer", after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overstated, and fans and journalists have noticed the musician's difficulty moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new admission.
Euro-2009/short pool: first Bousquet title at his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Championships in long swimming, won an international title on Thursday in a distance he feels particularly affection for, 50m free, during Euro-2009 in short swimming in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane swimmers were allowed to bathe for the last time, only three world records were broken when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who had set the world record in the 50m freestyle, a mark he holds in the long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two reigning distances of swimming, in 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman set himself up with 20'53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first at international level.
Bousquet outscored Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better, and in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane baths which will be banned from January 1.
These swimmers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same event.
This time the use of the baths did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to break his mark in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he set himself up with the second-best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself to this race.
I knew this time I wasn't going to be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and accomplish my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday for 1.5 million dollars, well above the estimated price, announced the art dealer at Sotheby's.
This panel, two meters long and 63 centimeters high, dates from the third century C.E., and was estimated to cost between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satires and drunken women, is a rare piece, as there are only four or five in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of auctions for ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It sold out in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot has been the most bid by buyers, without a doubt, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition by Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the home of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the home of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to move to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied safe conduct.
For now, after a phone conversation with President Zelaya in the evening, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
To grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "give up" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the deposed president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a guest head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign my office (...), they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he has been making statements since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, declared on Wednesday the Minister of Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, to the Honduran radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur network.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government against international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president Hugo Chávez, was ousted on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, which was rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be detained and will have to answer to the justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organise a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street is up, the U.S. trade balance is up.
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, and the US trade balance sheet figures are a faithful witness to the economic recovery of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the technology component Nasdaq 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We're getting good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "reflecting an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared with September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected the deficit to deepen.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly goods exports, which reflect the growth of the major economies trading with the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, with 474,000 applications submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "was the lowest in a year", noted Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond was 3,482% against 3,423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond yield was 4,492% against 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of the power abuchean to the "Ladies of White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban government supporters booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some 40 "Damas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, an AFP journalist said.
The Yankees die! "Mercenaries!" "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!" "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the militants of power were fisting at the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by officers dressed in civilian clothes who came to "protect" them.
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" in Havana was held the day before, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the international day of human rights were detained by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist reported.
The officers forcibly climbed the vehicles of the dissidents who were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents under such circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sajarov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "apply for the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissident, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities treat the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their declared enemy, the United States.
Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by government militants against "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A stranger kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves five wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne.
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (High Seine) on Thursday afternoon at the peak of the influx
According to the first evidence of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly stabbed an elderly man with two knives and for reasons not yet known, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in hospital, according to a senior officer of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or across the street, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with his partner.
The husband, about 30, got involved and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then fainted and was admitted "in shock", a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, escaped through Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
Apparently by chance, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a 30-year-old man, and another 40-year-old seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives and had crosses on his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a union official in the Seine Alts.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the stranger, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd rushed at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
At the Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at the height of No 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were stabbed to death, according to police testimony.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
People came to tell me there was a man injured on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, and when I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very serious wound in his abdomen, said 35-year-old pharmacist Frédéric Allione to AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers detained the man without identification.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office has submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the High Senate Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The lunatic was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he has not spoken.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of his being committed to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police to get him in control at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "over-excited" as "any disorder of this kind whose strength increases considerably under the effect of action".
US: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer for the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed for a sexual abuse case that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the director of "The Pianist", denounced three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeals for gross procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: "I demand that the charges be dropped at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before he could pronounce his sentence, which constitutes a serious procedural misconduct.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", by the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared in late September that he had " lied " to the documentary's author.
Hummel demanded a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he has never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles County District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be here to appear at the hearing".
With this case, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of escape?
She says the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, although he disregards its authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel wasn't the only one who asked to drop the case against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the case be closed.
She claims that her client no longer tolerates being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, awaiting eventual extradition.
Wall Street is losing its way and slowing down because of the dollar's rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday, in a market that is being debated between better indicators than the forecast in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, which is a technology component, lost 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points), to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trade is shrinking and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which 'helped improve market opinion on the strength of economic recovery', Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than forecast.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the index was held back by a further surge in the dollar against the euro, which reached its highest level in the last two months, "leading economically sensitive sectors to a downturn", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond was 3,540% against 3,482% on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bond yield was 4,497% against 4,492% the day before.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are on the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great beauty celebration organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already reached the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Sportswoman or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real uproar.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and lived countless experiences!
The ninth edition of the event, which is being held in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17h (15h GMT).
I can't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the southern summer heat.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "breath-taking African landscapes".
After a month of gala, rehearsal, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World candidates are focused on the contest.
India Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, Miss India declares with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dancing will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in a swimsuit.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has shown itself capable of welcoming the world with warmth and pride that are hard to match, says Miss World President Julia Morley.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shake their hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone observes.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the 2010 World Cup in June, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd meet.
She's probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", his son David said Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told reporters as he got off the plane he was taking from Paris shortly after local time of 13h (21 GMT).
The singer's son, who is unwell, said he would be transferred "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection from a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been put into a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection, a sequel to a herniated disc operation last November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated on again on Wednesday night due to serious injuries from the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school act, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at the hospital of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26 at the private international clinic of Parque Monceau, in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus declared.
There's talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor, and I was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, since I had two operations for herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he said that the singer had apparently "gone without a cannula, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also interviewed actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed following a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the court on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples" sued "regularly" before the Order's Council, and is "far from recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
The Commission stated that the intervention was "effective" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not require drainage", he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, went into a hiatus.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment against pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels in the environment is not yet fully implemented.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Centre about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the former Giscardist party's signet, urging it to withdraw it from all support, only to be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having reached out to him to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, it received the help of deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark, having first registered it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to give up the acronym and transfer ownership rights to the brand, subject to a court action.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that you would propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centre Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement's name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter argue.
As you know, you have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office, which demands that the NC immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all media, as well as from (its) website.
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of the mark to the rightful owners".
If not, it will appeal to the judiciary to uphold the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
The letter states that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recalls that Morin and his friends "choose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
He makes scandalous and fraudulent use of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do so on his own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name you do not have the right to".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of power
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to bring the artist François-Marie Banier to trial to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she used the octogenarian's weakness to extort a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of show stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of power, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a saga-worthy process about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are fighting over the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Court also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report before 10 March 2010 stating whether and during what periods Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness.
I think he'll take it.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, as he left the hearing.
The Court of Justice of the European Union has also decided to grant a special exemption to the applicant.
It is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuting François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations turned out to be, on occasion, a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for 15 years.
Since their wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again".
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, especially since a judge in charge of the guardianship had refused, in recent days, to give rise to her request to open a judicial custody procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the court, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person can appear in his place", said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that a decision would be taken once the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers had been rendered.
Management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of French big companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
Over a decade ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the attitude of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to 'values' determined from above, as before it was about imposing products designed by factory technicians on consumers.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to market-conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to customer preference factors is regularly repeated.
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much broader phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, particularly R & D and even more so business intelligence.
Indeed, Business Intelligence (BI) "requires all parties involved (...) to have proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision"; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
We therefore called for a management revolution, which would involve putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion polls, such as the Orange survey of employees, incite the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all companies end up doing essentially what they always did!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Lastly, because most executives have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behavioural theory that American "neuroscience" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Research and the media widely circulated behind their backs.
In this way, suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanical management stance, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises involves adopting a finalist view of human behaviour.
It is a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly seen as a means of making part of their dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this view of employee motivation.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilisation factors, business leaders can monitor, anticipate and anticipate their 'social performance' and relocate human resource management 'on-site'.
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organised development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama receives praise from the right for "just war"
On Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech Obama delivered on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited Obama's awarding of the award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, a leading figure on the right wing of the Republican Party, to USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself this Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered the president to have done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" remind Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current columnist for the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world", as he "always does", he "spoke like an American president" by reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it", Gerson said.
Among the few not convinced on the right, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and uninspiring" on the Internet site National Review Online.
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it's easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, although still believing Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap for guiding international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression", enthusiastically commented the California newspaper.
Obama "spoke the speech that was necessary", estimated the New York Times, calling it "both gloomy and uplifting".
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon sessions of negotiations, the trade unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon ending the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" at the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in the hope of signing the text quickly by late morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew giving a doorstep.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "was feared to disrupt the end-of-year parties", Bussereau said.
The text provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate goes up from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low-wage workers.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants to stop any cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, acknowledged that this was a "good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases in high wages given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros a month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common-sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel expenses and the holding of general assemblies on road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow for the main issues of an extra pay and a modernisation of the collective agreement to be addressed.
Bussereau recalled that "a €100 million reduction in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 amending finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "on the same terms".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies affiliated to this organisation and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "with the greatest brevity", Bussereau assured.
Opposition from employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "naïve business", since the €100 million had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to not upset those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, the Unostra lamented.
The agreement jeopardizes the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months.
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions disagreeing with RATP proposals
The conflicts at RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between unions and RATP management, there was no agreement and unions were dissatisfied with their claim for a premium.
For this important holiday shopping weekend, trains will only run between 10 and 20 hours on Saturday and Sunday, due to one train every two on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four on the other lines.
The SNFC interconnection will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP strives to provide service to the big stores".
The RER crosses the city of Paris from west to east.
The RATP route runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains ran in rush hour, and almost no trains in valley hours, as had been planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
Thus, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had gotten up "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time".
The station Saint-Lazare was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had planned police and law enforcement oversight.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut came to or from Saint-Lazare station to join the metro.
New general assemblies of striking workers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, and the results of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon, which the unions say were "unsatisfactory", will be discussed.
The Director of the RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol on all aspects of RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT said indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned for Monday to conduct "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of the profession", the RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company "didn't care about the weekend users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers raided a committee at headquarters in Paris.
The management, which had previously refused to engage in dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Indépendants have submitted a prior notice.
The unions are asking for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line which has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second stage of their professional career, charge between 2,200 and 2,700 gross euros and between 600 and 650 euros in premiums, for shiftwork, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the Prokurd party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked outrage in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the government's task, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the court's president, Hasim Kiliç, told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without party etiquette.
The decision follows a 2007 prosecution by the Supreme Court's prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, accusing the DTP of following the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government reaches out to the Kurdish community and proposes a series of measures to strengthen their rights so that the Kurds can stop supporting the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to a heightened tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
The Order forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov bombs or rocks with holes.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people also gathered.
After the verdict, Türk said the court's decision would "deepen discouragement".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, which is made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of parties.
This is not the way to solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotted the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something that wants to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the ESF
But with it, your employees can learn to test and master all vehicle technology.
Maybe the weathermen will announce it for the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to handle the snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as snow is heavy in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, 20 of the so-called A-sections with large salt vehicles emerge, Brauburger explains.
For example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also the access to the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The ESF service starts around 3:00 a.m.
They should cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres best.
The ESF therefore starts around 3am, "with the roads being clear until traffic starts at rush hour".
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"So we have a problem", says the winter road maintenance director, "because then nobody is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt".
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is for side and secondary streets.
That's where the trouble comes in, Brauburger knows it.
Around 5 a.m. the FES infantry is launched, clearing up the most dangerous spots and cruisers.
The ESF could not normally take over all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of bridges, says Brauburger.
As these quickly slip, the salted vehicle is started as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call you.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-meter-long, 1.50-meter-high animal that ran on its two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this wouldn't have been anything special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It tells us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the spread, and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavation in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we've found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
During the excavation they collected the remains of five specimens.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt says that "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found".
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: carnivorous theropods, including Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also birds, quadruped sauropods known as "long-necked" sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores (bird-bellied sauropods), to which, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus belong.
According to Nesbitt and his colleagues' analysis, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, in the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of air pockets, such as those also held by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In the case of Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag-operated theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the lineage of later giant sauropods also possessed airbags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers conclude that the saurians first appeared there.
As a result, the three genealogical lineages were initially separated and spread from South America to all corners of the earth, which at that time still formed a single landmass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa hallae the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
All three cannot descend from a single, related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study Science.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their view could give a distorted picture, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral lineage of reptiles to the dominant land vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains a mystery.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of the current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the Triassic boundary towards the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat their opponents in the area.
Success stories aren't always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Triassic and since then have led a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California are involved.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen are taking part.
The police eviction of the occupied Frankfurt Goethe University casino has had a worldwide impact.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students protesting at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "refuse" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building occupied by students and teachers on strike evacuated last week, because the walls and artwork were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The damage to property, the signatories say, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction was an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The Board of Directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand immediate withdrawal of the court complaint.
Most of the occupants have not caused any material damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi's national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister for Science in Hessen, however, defended the actions of the rector of the university and the police.
We're grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable, he commented in an Aktuelle Stunde broadcast on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Provincial Parliament.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, provincial parliamentary delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of studying the students' arguments and demands thoroughly, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion, asking the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police intervention.
The New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the 216,000-strong community, located 37 kilometers from central Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
They visited each other on several occasions and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign a "Protocol on close cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow's Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad's Mayor Anatoly Smirnov headed the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz signed.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the Natural Sciences Research Centre will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also deals with business relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to enter the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to improve the quality of the services provided by the European Union.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were settled.
Brakes from Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not high enough for anything.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply and simply 'the new heart of Europe'.
The S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate a decade of chaos on irremediable construction sites in the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with railways, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at the time 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes on modern rail traffic, as in the past it took a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives backwards forward.
Roll, stop on dry continue the journey; but this is how it must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is about halfway between the transEuropean lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan 'Heart of Europe'.
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have any more problems of entry and exit either, since there are reversible locomotives with a tractor unit and driver's car at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 including the newly built ICE stretch to Ulm will be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged it this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer's computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably greener than road transport by trucks.
However, the new sections under construction are good for us for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe it's more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be lacking at other narrow crossings and passages on the network.
In total, sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of over 180 kilometres of long railways through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 the layout has been built in slow motion.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport through the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the ruling on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the Wiesbaden regional parliament whether it will appeal the judgment on the night-time flight ban by the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the 400-page VGH ruling, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had argued in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned North-West runway at Frankfurt Airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the prohibition on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to appeal this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to drop the appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD leader, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their pledges to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It's quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, that the federal government would be trying to get its night flights through misrepresentations of law and tricks.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a while.
The coalition would not like to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally sound decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition stands, it would never have been his group's claims about the ban on night air traffic.
U.S. banks return the loans.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripping off their state bonds.
The Bank of America once again returned the aid it had received from the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And Citi Group also plans to return state aid, according to a report from US CNBC.
The institutions are thus seeking to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had obtained approximately 19 billion in cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had a considerable amount of money, including the sale of rubles.
Bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayers especially Wednesday night for helping to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of absorbing the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
Citi also aims to raise money on the capital market to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source familiar with the matter that the US bank could announce an increase of its capital by 20 billion dollars by Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their subsidies.
Rapid election
It all ended up happening faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF board pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can introduce a successor.
Last night the guild was planning to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main studio at ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially to avoid anticipating the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced the fact that the ZDF director Markus Schächter was not harmed any more, if this proposal was not approved by the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 guild members.
The results of the vote were not yet known at the close of the present edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him.
Because the majority of the Union on the Administrative Council had already indicated weeks before the election that they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief had been organised by the Hesse government chairman, Mr Roland Koch.
He declined another term of office from the prestigious editorial head with the argument that under Brender's direction the ZDF's news reports would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he flagelled the political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, 35 experts in public law had even intervened in the debate, calling Koch's conduct unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romantic philology.
He then worked for the broadcaster "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to ZDF, initially to the "heute-journal" newsletter.
The following seasons: 1988 to 1990 as a staff speaker for the head of the editorial board; 1991/92 as a correspondent in Washington; until 1998 as director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 as director of foreign policy for the ZDF; since then as director of the ZDF's study in the capital.
The Greens' political party announced a constitutional lawsuit after the impeachment of Brender, who was elected as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin" on Wednesday.
In contrast to Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the federal states should change the ZDF state convention in such a way that the director's personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of politicians supporting the ZDF control guilds was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr Peter Frey, was recommended to the board of directors with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for removing Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor without losing his face, and the administrative council was able to vote for him without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a partisan secretive.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is still assigned to the left-wing liberals.
College careers are cleared
Partial success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the Federal Ministers of Education and Culture finally gave up.
Students in the future should be able to surpass their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each module of the course must end with only one examination.
The aim is to examine the workload of students and to ensure a 'real and justifiable measure'.
The policy and the universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to making more flexible structural rules for bachelor and master's degrees together.
Federal regulations that differ from this, should no longer exist.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the university rectors have been continuously talking about improving the ability to successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now for the first time, a specific content was discussed.
The accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam", says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university courses.
The 'sensitive reduction of the burden of examination' is intended to avoid the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studying ability, explained the Director of the Accreditation Council, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, 'studiable' should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be examined thoroughly as to unnecessary restrictions on students' choice of language.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new races, but also to existing races.
These must be "re-accredited" every five years, but this would mean it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
The responsibility for this would be at the countrywide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is set up by the federal states.
Ministers of education and culture urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Palatinate has ensured that additional means are provided for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counselling programmes, as well as strengthen exam and foreign offices.
The Federal State and universities intend to provide 10 million euros for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
She said a single exam should be enough to complete a career model.
The course configuration should be made more flexible, and evaluations at other universities should be recognised and the Master's degree should be made more accessible.
The aim is to examine all courses for their "studiable" status by the end of next year.
On Thursday, the government and opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal board of directors of the Juso (Young Socialist) university groups argued that education policy should no longer be set up "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as the main participants should be able to vote as well.
The president of the university rectors' board (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the students' experience", she said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union demanded a legal right for every student with a bachelor's degree to access a further Master's degree.
The Federal States must also ensure that there are in the future sufficient places for the present generation of Bachelor students to study for a Master's degree with the best possible study conditions.
The states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Education Ministers did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrollable", says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalanced linguistic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader at a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable lectures or lectures on poetry at Frankfurt's Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse literature forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he spoke a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted to participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In 1989, together with some of those present, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
The recruitment efforts had begun slowly, early in 1971.
"I am therefore someone who has not defended himself sufficiently against the attempts to provoke fear by the Securitate", concluded Söllner.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and especially the community of Romanian-born German authors are shaken by a case that demonstrates the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only the author but also the victim.
In his file with Securitate IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
I had excused him or defended him at every difficult point for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement", he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen spies, wrote Herta Müller in the weekly Zeit in July, after reading her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved have probably speculated and in some cases known what names were behind the aliases of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the review of Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the control files by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hindered in recent years.
A national Securitate Records Clearing Council (CNSAS), under the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999 and the delivery of records has been carried out on a regular basis since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large.
"She has psychosis", she was only questioned once in the end.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without a twist in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often happens when there are silent culprits.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession leaves us hopeful that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings for knowledge than by the attribution of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it gave the impression that a member of the outdoor service, elegantly dressed, was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sportswear manufacturer had handed out samples.
The bald-faced man had hired a chauffeur, because he still didn't know the city.
Otherwise, he could have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol involved, and the 55-year-old was also not drunk with joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the eighth round", namely in the Champions League, thanks to a 3:1 win against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by the success: we will have to fight brutally against the relegation".
"The much more important task was for them next Sunday", he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "royal classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have clearly been demonstrated again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
The lottery
The Champions League Eight Final (one-off matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/back matches on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be played on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was kept limited by the flashing entry of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had shortly inspired the bewildered professionals of Stuttgart confidence, willingness to surrender and love of the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more focused, soul repairman Gross explained his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with therapist Babbel had no effect.
He unleashed a certain magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann agreed, "When a new momentum arises in football, sometimes things happen that we never thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who after a several-week break due to injury quickly progressed to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "perceived phenomenon with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new boss's way of working: "He is a deeply involved man, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation".
And this is what had been lacking, obviously, when Babbel was here.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs consistency above all.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the victory against a weak defense due to lack of relegation and totally outperforming the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had come the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt didn't feel like celebrating his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been awarded by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, faced Heldt with Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had blamed weakness in direction on the board, which had decided to change coach because of pressure from teenage fans.
Also that his day off had been eliminated after the games was described by Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were marked by pure selfishness", replied Heldt, announcing consequences for the javelin.
They're probably not friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the prior efforts with the replacement coach's team, the show of great game and battle strength would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had a "significant share in the success", Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World heavyweight championship fight
Burning duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnson was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains the world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Friday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already two times world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had been waiting for could not be carried out.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators at the Arena in Bern, Klitschko, who was 2.02 meters tall, wanted to dictate the fight mostly with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters shorter, who had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was avoiding the world champion's blows again and again, so Klitschko could not decisively lead his dangerous right to his target.
Generally speaking, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, to endure twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already caused a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "can't do anything".
When weighing, the champion was challenged on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose so he could see his eyes".
Fourth win since Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained unbeatable.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in his title defenses.
In this fight I only got a hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still to bring all four important titles into his family.
His brother Vladimir is the World Champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British man David Haye, after he deposed in November Nikolai Valujev, who is 2.13 meters tall.
Last summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
The company that promotes him is reportedly already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontline attack by the opposition: the leader of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin  Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of knowingly cheating.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by the ARD television channel, the head of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly hadn't told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he lied.
The killing order would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Security Forces for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was reported that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also deliberately killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak out immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Foreign Office, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, decidedly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery had no influence on the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the presentation by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had correctly and completely informed Gutenberg about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the surroundings of the two senior officials it transcended that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert had requested in a letter that the matter be clarified, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung.
So far, he hasn't received a response, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations made to it on Saturday, and said it would clarify this in the Federal Parliament's investigation committee, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamy worlds
While awake, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and the drug addicts do the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhinderedly surrender to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience sleep-like states while awake, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are most often considered in the modern Western world to be mad or drug addicts, or at least to be maniacs.
But such images and voices do not just come to mind in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
It's our imagination that's to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes blur the lines between sleep, madness and reality.
The dreamically modified states of alertness can appear in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to as visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Charles Castañeda, states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often appear.
Gravity has no power over him anymore.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of insanity to dream states", for Sigmund Freud, sleep was even "a psychosis, with all its mispurposes, crazy formations, and mirages".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book character.
Her body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, it's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of devils with wings, with blood-red moustaches, deformed, grinding teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Screaming, evil voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand the voices that insult and offend him anymore.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, ties them together to form a hanging knot, and fixes them on a hook in the ceiling.
It's on a hook and the knot is around the neck.
- Jump up.
The rope is loose.
What a lesson! Cry out in a chorus that tears your ears, go to the clinic and get cured!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of her death was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic-affective-paranoid psychosis, he's also manic-depressive, he's on medication, he's on depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population falls ill at least once in their lifetime with schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and they fall into a state of over-excitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecutory mania.
Specifically, voice hearing is widespread: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the doors to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at the University Hospital of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he becomes passive, like in a dream, feeling overwhelmed by events and unable to organize them actively.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
It's not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Have experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is".
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, distancing from experience takes place in reality.
Researchers still have a question about why our brains make convertibles.
According to Fuchs, states of exception can cause anyone to lose contact with reality temporarily.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition for schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that in addition to genes, there are other determinants.
Researchers assume that the affected individuals suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role  stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a previous disposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's transmitting system.
When the brain gets hot
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from hallucinations and take expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether or not a hallucination is pleasant often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
These include, alongside psychological disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranial-encephaltic trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are usually repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain where sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are not restrained; when our brain is warming up, but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition in much the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, love sickness or other exceptional brain states.
In the case of studies on the subject of childhood, the following are the main points:
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
A regular girl.
If it wasn't for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during the play, it happens that a clumsy boy with long dark hair addresses her.
When she answers, the other students look at her in amazement; no one, except her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a freakish dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, just like she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Vision is often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher  in his eyes and ears  is introducing a new classmate, while for the rest he explains mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, he cannot tell whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the smiles or the girl with bloody cuts to her arms and legs, appear before his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents and friends anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
It's been a year since the hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since you got in touch with psychologist Kasten over the Internet, you know she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or is restricted by stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and is in charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was a little afraid of the other children and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at age 13, she learned that the man she's been calling dad since she's had reason is not her biological father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, affected people like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality.
Hallucinations are just as much images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real".
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
The boundary between sleep and hallucination
In this world too consciously centered, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated what he calls oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person experiencing them considers real and that can subsequently not be differentiated from being awake.
Sleep-conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or illness, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened with a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a real and imaginary world of its own that is disconnected from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own creative capacity allows us not to sink into the void of loss of consciousness.
It's all real, even later in memory
Also the Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when his conscience embarked on several-day journeys following a heart valve operation with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in a world he created and visited strange places from other times: he was seen lying in bed, an older man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the snow-filled Alps and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys were fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
More clear and intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of the outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality".
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow may come
The following is the list of the products:
The children will take over the publishing house at 27 years old
The new publisher Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg  Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at age 27 and have a firm will to join the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precaution.
The next question is whether they will be actively involved in the company.
Also, if they're trained for it.
You cannot put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained.
That would end the kids and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will step down from the board chairmanship in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of the Burda management since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
He later became treasurer and with this came responsibility for the company's assets.
For the first time, no family member is on the editorial board.
Burda's children are 19 and 17, and her son Felix, now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, according to Burda, "save the differences of 10, 15 years".
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said family businesses are not safe from decay either: "This has always affected families who are infected by the drive to seek capital, who have judged wrongly and thought they could rise as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "delusions of greatness", says Burda.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Whole beauty
Everything you can wish for, in terms of beauty and well-being, within reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed by the English Court, which has just opened a multi-disciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid) dedicated to body care and care.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which deals with laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the feeding of the breast feeds is prominent, with over 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the city's stunning views, or rent a two-hour relaxation area to have your own beauty party with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi, massage and a glass of champagne are some of Spacion's possibilities.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms for the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' who guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by inserting your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your manager says 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to exercise all the muscles in your body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to go to the hairdresser's, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where hair restoration rituals, brightness or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 am to 22:00 pm.
Various skates
Christmas is coming and it's never too late to look at the looks of the stars to fit them into our party dressing room.
The shape of the scythe, which is very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables we must take into account.
There's a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an overly complicated scout.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created the 'Office LIVE'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of Electric Vehicles) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and reach agreements on mobility, management, coordination, subsidy submission, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it aims to boost the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to boost the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main productive plants", the President of the Government said.
"Thanks to this plan and the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector", he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed to both the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed governmental measures to support demand, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the President, this plan has reduced by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew by "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Motor Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for engine professionals and enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is a 20,000 square metre exhibition area with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can classic motorcycles and cars be found, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find all kinds of items related to the world of motorcycles.
The exhibitors of the pavilion will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic motorcycle will delight collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies are, among others, Classics de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration; or Cochera Classics, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Tests of ability abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this exhibition will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on an enabled circuit outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sporting activity
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not bound by respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just introduced the stop and start system of the engine - dubbed i-Stop-, a device that is at least for the moment only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good grade achieved overall.
Finish, finish of the vehicle, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects stand out in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving seat, we check that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and grip.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following the ensemble made up of the instrument panel and console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one that the Honda Civic also presents.
We can therefore say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To this is added a large suitcase with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and the six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a delight, and it stands out for its finesse, its low noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And it's that while the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who don't run a high number of kilometers a year shouldn't rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, both for its high ride comfort and for its low consumption.
As regards the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
The standard equipment is particularly notable for the lane change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitive internal mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioner, the rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, if its equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
The conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It is particularly notable for the quality of the materials used, for its behaviour and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not run many kilometres a year can opt for this i-Stop version, which is only associated with the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback to this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
In return for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day a large dose of satisfaction.
Luxury 'premiere'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality from the hand of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars glittered more than ever wrapped in models as stylish as 'sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'.
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as she usually is, opted for a dark "lady".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, with no possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, it's true, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what you pay for, say, the iPhone's data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a WiFi coffee shop (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and it should have been in place for a long time.
Yeah, some operators have special deals and travel plans, but in my experience, you need a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read fine print.
The European Commission's repeated push for affordable roaming charges across Europe has had little noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin, people are afraid to use data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (which is still curious to name Fon when it lacks Wi-Fi) gets this kind of fee means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other internet queries.
No contracts and no whistles.
It's a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month to month.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime access purchase option like what Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'll check my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the American first lady.
If you've already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States in a dress and a coat of this color, you've chosen it to accompany him at, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the Oslo Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on two occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections - the outfit was made up of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States was following the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurium.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the takeover it was a thick lace, in Oslo it's a velvet with a stamp.
The accessories have also varied: green half-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And the hairstyle is just as different: one picked up this time, one loose the previous hairstyle.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger generation women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed in the study 'Fertility and career of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 shows no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have found employment opportunities limited because of maternity.
The study shows that there are many differences in the start of cohabitation and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job start cohabitation earlier, advance their first maternity, and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with fixed jobs have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their life path to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work carried out exerts a great influence on motherhood but less on the timing of mating", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that makes the age difference between women getting married and having their first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the couple gets married and the older their first child is.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35-49, those with primary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"Another division is also established between women based on their level of education.
While those with basic education get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child", Delgado details.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, chanting the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris signatures, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Losses').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its top representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - gathered for the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but looking for something similar to the igniting core of the creative character.
Travel has its excitements and Vicent doesn't spare scares or lighting.
In addition to being an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and re-reads.
I'll leave you with some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same one I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against the agonizing destiny, moral innocence and innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his intellect, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling, senseless poetic humor, like the blade of a knife that was about to kill him".
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition".
About James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, to be climbed through the north wall, from which the best climbers stand down again and again".
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said he was the heir to a county landlord and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were great".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the mad cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to bring its echo to the bottom of the 20th century night in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms".
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to stop me writing like a woman.'"
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The sleep after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after the life of tiredness pleases death".
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
Her husband would normally accept her telling him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never has there been the case of such a patient and in love man with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness".
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to do but pass on to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man's fame so he could serve as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of 15- to 18-year-olds passed by her and our dog, a specimen of the mestizo breed, rescued from the dog and weighing no more than six kilograms and, without a word, kicked two kicks that left the dog unharmed.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a free aggression against a small, defenseless animal, which by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that caused a lady who walked quietly and who, when she attacked these individuals, became afraid for their physical integrity, since an energetic attacking an animal is capable of doing the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at five o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt would be of much use and not to generate susceptibility, only to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's happening among young people to make them think it's fun to treat a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We don't know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among younger drivers, both entities reported today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing ever safer products" and that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safe products.
Sales of light commercials rise
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12,6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the Anfac manufacturers' and Ganvam sellers' employers' offices.
The good, not surprising, figure should be quarantined as the benchmark with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% from the previous year.
As a result, despite the upturn in the last month, the cumulative enrollment in these 11 months is 40% below that of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, plus all vehicles that make up the light commercial sewing cart: derivatives of cars, pickup trucks, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
The clouds that most affect demand have also not disappeared, since although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
The Commission has therefore decided to extend the scope of the directive to the Member States.
In this context, and unlike the cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial enterprise of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, they can be welcomed, but the number of operations has been impressive.
Yesterday, from Ganvam, they reminded us of the need to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sellers' association forecasts a similar 2010 to the year ending, for which it calculates a fall in sales (for cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As with the ABS brake block and will pass the ESP stability check, emergency braking support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly registered light commercial and passenger cars, while a shortage period is fixed for the rest until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's measure aims to increase pedestrian protection, although its working method can also help prevent many collisions by reach.
The emergency brake assistant does what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's pitch.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure up until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake before the collision and half of them had not used all the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the braking system to be kept at its maximum, reducing the distance the car takes to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these types of devices, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatal accidents could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even greater - one in four accidents involving damage to people is estimated to be avoided - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are introduced.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and alerts the driver, as well as acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
In the event that it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device shall apply maximum effort to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones the Opel plan until January
While Opel's Figueruelas (Zaragoza) plant workers have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably on the 8th - as reported by Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will take longer to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points in the plan have been agreed upon by the party concerned.
And this may cause the final document to be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until early 2010.
On the other hand, GM assures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but is gaining ground on the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it doesn't sell remains.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, and jewel face, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and made it slim down to no less than 80 kilograms, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to abandon, first of all, the automatic ceiling that has been supplied by a canvas with manual drive, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' others 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, they gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports bacquets another 12 and with the 19 inch light tires, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system brought in another six kilograms and changing the door shooters for some fabric, the remaining kilogram.
Although also offered with the dual clutch PDK switch, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox unit, mainly on California secondary roads, on mountain sections with actually reversed tracks
His behavior can only be called impeccable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with flatness.
Rather, quite the opposite: we hadn't tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, would convey so much safety in the corner, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a short walk for as long as it takes, until we order him to squeeze, to brake, to recover and to squeeze his engine back...
Thanks to your direction, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine whistle, already released earlier in the Panamera.
Acceleration capability is brutal, whether from a stop or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road pavement we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely made an appearance throughout the journey; and that in some of the corners we found ice at dawn and gravel, already early in the morning.
In short, an ultra-lightweight car, one of the most fun to drive you can get on the market and that's more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate with Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' from the 'maison' parades, the singer prodies her badass face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia is awarded a victory in Israel
The Labour Box achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra pitch, despite the numerous losses Dusko Ivanovic's team had, and thus it is positioned in the lead of its group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 of valuation).
The Victorian team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to make up for the victory.
Also, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match started straight for the blue-green, who were placed from the start ahead of the scorer.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already signaled that they had jumped to the Israeli court with their hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's indoor play and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with cheers and applause on the return to their home, to further expand their lead to the rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less six' rating already made it clear that this would not be the best night for the Brazilian.
But the match, despite being headed to the break, was not decided much less and the Macabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court no one wins, and with 'Elijah's hand' squeezing they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellow's turn to the bright (50-49).
More inconvenience
Ivanovic's, wounded but not much less dead, needed to make a couple of good moves to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring rent (54-67), which managed to make up the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaves went out to leave their skin in the final part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, their team's best, did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by mistake, Ivanovic's did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the game was already owned and the victory was to escape Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent the Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost in Greece to Olympiacos and ceded the lead of Euroleague group B to him, in a match marked by the losses of the boxers, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion or by the rival entity, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream.An aggressive defense and three consecutive triplets, two from base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local arsenal in the home game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which point a fight-on-fight action, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set began to function showing its superiority within both areas, where the injury drop of English pitcher Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were burdening the cashiers.
Between the inside players and the Lithuanian striker Linas Kleizas, with their triple, increased the lead 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible ride
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, showed superiority and even came to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group's lead wobble.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last down of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja had with Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' input, it left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos when they were tight and given their superiority in centimeters within the zone proved unstoppable.
Croatian center fielder Nikola Vujcic managed to pick up the basketball average of 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went out, giving the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the most classified real estate, employment and motor ads in Spain.
The How Much Should You Charge tool calculates users' salaries from the more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week the application is in operation, the searcher has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels badly remunerated", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data from Trovit's search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros a year in gross revenue and a French computer programmer receives 31,059 euros a year, compared with 24,000 euros for a Spanish computer programmer.
Similarly, a driver receives an annual net charge of EUR 34.247 in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with an annual net income of 11,592 euros; followed by that of a dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of an operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after online jobs in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President shall leave the diplomatic legacy by 27 January 2010, the date on which his term of office would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of business at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date from the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, at the end of his term, he must seek another destination".
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately thwarted by Zelaya's refusal to be granted political asylum by the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets again, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about the future by uncertainty.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar at near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets for discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to throw some sand on the gears as the ECB did with its annual auction next week.
Investors are therefore questioning the global economy's ability to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond differentials have rebounded, although they are still far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have been the refuge of choice for investors, leading to an increase in the gap between the eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but then Standard & Poor's came along and threatened a further downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not bad enough to silence moral risk advocates who were trying to re-create a sense of responsibility for those responsible for world economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, the case of Dubai depicts a tribal struggle between the emirates to reconcile power in the emirates and Greece as we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin would save Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it would allow a euro country to default on its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected range.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads like European corporate bonds do, we should not worry.
If the European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then this would be idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote: when our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their upward scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are back on the charts with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, it does not bode well for life expectancy to your warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "prudence, driver friend".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is being discussed.
After his intervention, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushes of what he had put forward in the subcommission closed door.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investment should not be directed towards increasing capacity in generation, but towards distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue changes and the power will have to be increased.
Its stake is focused on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW of new, yes, with other "support energies" are needed.
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Law that the government has just approved is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of combating climate change.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term stake" in this regard, despite the "point-to-point" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán considers that investment decisions, although long-term, should be started as they are slow to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' handling at ten airports
The Commission considers that the Commission has not yet established a specific measure to prevent the use of the airport by airlines in the context of the current situation.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not been transcended by the economic terms, is for a period of five years.
In addition, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of collaboration to create the Center for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% is to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Actiona disputes his first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.04 billion euros).
French Bouygues and German Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and concessionaire.
City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the Administration has a final list of candidates to get the job done and exploit the toll.
The projected investment, which is expected to be submitted in May, amounts to A$1.7 billion (€1.047 billion) and is being carried out by three consortia with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group, dubbed Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish liza, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium plays, with British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to cross the line is the LBRJV, where capital is shared by the Australian company Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which is also owned by ACS), the local company Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the civil works firm Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large-scale construction and privatisation, but it has a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the cited Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which remains a pending subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
The amount of the assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It is now their intention to consolidate those two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the City of Brisbane's Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link, is intended to connect the Western Toowong Highway with the Kelvin Grove bypass (see map) along a 5 km tunnel.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of the following year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute A$500 million (€308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit for Hochtief, which yesterday announced the acquisition of a government contract worth 154 million.
The ACS-owned company will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fibre optic cable.
This action will provide 400,000 people with quick access to the Internet and will give the German woman 18 months' work.
The company has also completed the construction of the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia, which was still under construction and Hochtief has closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, particularly in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarding a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the contract to construct a 2.1 km long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia for an amount of EUR 64,5 million.
The firm obtained this contract days after completing the 130 million Bosruck Tunnel extension works.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is planned for early 2010 and the implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarding Renfe's ad.
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services to Mrs Rushmore for the next two years for an annual amount of approximately EUR 3 million, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Mrs Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined 63 million for curbing competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Télécom EUR 63 million for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to France.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has in fact been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
Application shop
Moreover, the French company's mobile subsidiary has followed the footsteps of other operators and opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenues other than voice broadcasting.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, like Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and Barcelona have collected 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it's also one of the main sources of revenue for big clubs.
The competition has allocated €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out well out of this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent to have the most money pocketed for participating, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, billed more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to have won the most money through the Championships, despite having won more titles than any other (five, out of four from Italy, three from England and two from Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure of UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to raise €1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will allocate 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2,1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million for being there alone, plus another 550,000 euros for each match they compete in.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for drawing (400,000 for each team).
The last four will pocket $4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, versus $5.2 million for the finalist.
In the case of fixed payments, a club will receive at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the major languages, and it has four seats.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers €61 million for the 29.9% stake in Sos
The New Rumasa group yesterday ungranted the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for all the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share to be paid over 10 years and paid with interest on the 1% annual deferral.
Yesterday Sos' shares closed at 1,85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects Sos' real valuation.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Cherezano group gives the shareholders 15 days to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the company of the Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If implemented, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos's capital is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is continuing to restructure his address.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the judicial vibrancy of its former directors, brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, he announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created position which will depend directly on the group chairman.
And it's not without controversy, as the company is still engaged in a legal battle over the alleged diversion of more than $230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazar, yesterday declared in the National Audience the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorises the exclusion order of Paternina submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Commission for Value Markets (CNMV) authorised yesterday the exclusion clause introduced by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorised this operation on the understanding that its terms were in line with the rules in force and that the content of the explanatory note submitted following the amendments made on 2 December was considered 'sufficient'.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 8,95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142.786 shares admitted to trading on the Stock Exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
It also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transferred in any way until the tender is completed, of which it specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools for car inspection
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do car dealerships win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage and the repair costs.
No accident is the same, and calculating parts costs and labour time can be a long and complicated job.
Manually calculating the cost of repairs of between €20,000 and €30,000, including annual workpieces, can take two to three hours.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
That's why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for accident and maintenance assessments are dedicated to collecting the information supplied by manufacturers, then developing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the Solera group in the United States, is the leading company; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of valuation and information tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's commercial director, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that only versions have been released in the last five years, with variations in the motorization of the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It's a very difficult task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter their price.
In addition, each model is made a "smart" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinched".
If it's a windmill model, the job can be done in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three to four months.
Among the most exclusive models, there is information on Porsche, but not on Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park circulating, they're over 99%.
For the documentation and database work, Audatex has eight centres spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialized in a specific brand.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer a variety of products.
The most common use is for repair and maintenance, but depending on which country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of goods used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
The products offered by Audatex make it easy to get an idea of the kind of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for the assessment of claims, aimed at experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the manufacturer's estimated repair times or paint bars.
This tool is paid for each evaluation.
The highest cost is 5,75 euros for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then every insurance company, which does thousands of scrutiny, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and equipment that left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle moons, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the professional sector that allows bidding for vehicles declared to be totally damaged.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or knowing deviations by homodel markings.
For example, it can be studied how many models of a particular brand have been through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company devoted to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, inter alia, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of the car
The Gt Appraisal Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at an annual rate of 20% over the last three years, and in 2008 it generated revenues of EUR 10,8 million.
At the beginning of last year they started their process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19,1 million euros, up 7.2% from the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth a billion dollars on the stock exchange, and now its shares are trading for a total value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007 it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of crashed cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for selling cars such as motorcycles or damaged special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of EUR 59,5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrap and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
The platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and manages over 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been retired cannot be recycled, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a spare.
Historically valuable cars can be discharged even if they have been discharged after a few lavish gestures.
Budget for the four-step workshop
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the replacement, create a budget and generate a budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use it.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, an actual graphical image of the model in question is displayed and the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, surcharges or discounts, and then print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working on making these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
