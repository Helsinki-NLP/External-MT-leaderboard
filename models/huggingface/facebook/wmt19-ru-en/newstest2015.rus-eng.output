Russia's FANO to Hold Final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia), together with the Russian Academy of Sciences, will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the Efficiency of Scientific Organizations."
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received by the editorial office of Lenta.ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to sum up the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators to assess the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for forming expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events aimed at developing a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded in this, and the final version of the normative documents is in the process of being agreed upon.
According to the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation, "said Elena Aksenova, Head of the Expert and Analytical Department of FANO of Russia.
Representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutions of Russia will take part in the event.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 am Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the following address: 14 Solyanka Street, Moscow.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of experts will make it possible to search for related stars, that is, those that emerged from the same cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and a summary of them can be found on the university's website.
The reason for the uniform chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulent mixing in gas clouds that precedes star formation.
Even if a newly born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine its place of birth and the region where related stars were formed.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The simulations conducted by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, the researchers used a supercomputer to simulate two streams of interstellar gas that together formed a cloud.
Within a few million years, the object is transformed by its own gravity into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added tagging paints to the original gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
According to astrophysicists, their research proves that it is possible to search for related stars by chemical composition, as well as to determine the possible regions of formation of such objects.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after high-speed motorcycle chase
A motorcycle has been seized after it was driven at 125km / h in a 70km / h zone and across a bushland to evade police in the Pilbara.
A transport police patrol in Karratha this morning tried to stop a blue motorcycle after finding it reaching 125km / h as it left a service station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist failed to stop and continued on Burgess Road, then veered into Bushland, causing officers to lose sight of him.
The motorcycle and a man matching the description of the driver were spotted near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha Police have charged a 20-year-old man with failing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear in the Karratha Magistrates Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Judge Lady Rae set a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh for November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not "slam the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not withdraw from the WTO
Russia will not "slam the door" on new sanctions.
This was stated today by the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
I will not even speculate about our response in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, because everything has to be specifically calculated, "he said.
And when we understand what our European and American partners will agree to this time, we will decide how to respond.
It will not be connected with the slamming of doors or any grievances misunderstood, "the Minister stressed.
First of all, we will start from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners in terms of their adequacy, negotiability and reliability.
On the basis of the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are seeking, "the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry continued.
If it is said aloud that "they will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do so in order to punish Russia," this is probably not very adequate. "
As far as the WTO is concerned, Russia's withdrawal in response to possible new sanctions is not.
On the contrary, we want to more actively master the instruments of the WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we consider discriminatory EU policies on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and anti-dumping measures are applied against sectors of the Russian economy.
"We are also ready to use WTO mechanisms to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the EU's third energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use lilacs correctly in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Because lilacs lose their main appeal after blooming, it is advisable to plant them together with other shrubs.
It blends perfectly with many cultures.
Moreover, lilacs can and should be planted alongside plants that are ornamental at other times, as well as plants that bloom at the same time.
Another plus of lilacs is that they provide plenty of creativity.
You can shape it into a stamped tree of various heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base, and even a garden bonsai - a tree with a whimsical curved trunk.
Simply choose the shape that best suits the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of Leningrad Oblast was convicted for selling counterfeit money
According to the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal trade in Olonetsk and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets District Court.
In order to complete the investigation into the crimes committed in our republic, he was transferred to Segezha.
In the course of the investigation, several episodes of selling counterfeit money, dating back to the summer of 2013, were proven guilty.
At the end of June of this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to court.
On Friday, August 29, the court issued a decision to replace the term of imprisonment with four years to be served in a penal colony.
The verdict has not entered into force.
Recall that last week, two more dealers of counterfeit money were convicted, which they paid for in stores in Petrozavodsk.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is imprisoned for five years, the other for four years.
Each was sentenced to a fine of 500 thousand roubles.
The verdict, too, has not yet entered into force.
Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first Dervish convoy
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid from the United States and Great Britain to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombala.
Representatives of Arkhangelsk's veteran organizations and children from the cadet class gathered for the event.
We first met twenty-three years ago, when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who were not returned by the sea, "noted Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Shipping Company.
Then, a city brass band performed at the event, and students from cadet classes presented flowers to the veterans and marched with the Russian flag and the Victory Banner.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five British vessels and one Dutch transport vehicle loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniforms, tin, wool, and a host of other equipment).
In addition, the ships also carried military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Hurricane fighter jets, in dismantled condition.
At the same time, the convoy was escorted by 16 Royal Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The convoy of vessels was not detected by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in the vital caravan operations, a total of 126 transport ships and some 50 warships were killed.

Remembering the Very American Ideal that Labor Rights Are Human Rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation that would protect union organizing as a civil right.
"Where unions are, there are middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
That is why I am proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill would give workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade unions as other forms of discrimination, deterring anti-union forces
Amending the Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for organizing trade unions to seek justice in the civil courts - and to receive damages and punitive damages - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the bill's co-sponsors are proposing is to recall a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country - Americans once supported countries around the world to embrace, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time, still remembered by millions of Americans, when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo's militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan, they included text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, to bargain, and to act collectively is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations for the purpose of protecting and improving working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or occupation.
Agreements that limit or seek to limit this right will have no legal force; measures aimed at this end will be deemed illegal.
When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions for the protection of his interests."
For generations, Americans took for granted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and to have the union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - must be protected.
Now that those rights are under assault in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone now knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted an entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, as it should.
Formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and expanded civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against union organizing - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically enlarged America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisiana abortion clinics
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of a Louisiana law that supporters say will likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
The measure, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to take effect on September 1, would require doctors who perform abortions to have the authority to receive patients at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's ruling means that, for the time being, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authority.
"Plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to act to obtain authorization," Judge John deGravells wrote in his ruling.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which the judge will make a more permanent ruling on the law.
Abortion rights advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authorization.
"Today's ruling ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the stay-the-law lawsuit on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts recently ruled such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have shut down most of the state's remaining clinics were blocked by a federal judge Friday.
Abortion rights advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admission authority laws impose medically unnecessary restrictions on doctors.
Abortion opponents counter that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some have also pointed to their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing the procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while their applications for admission authority await a decision.
What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products lead to?
No less than half of the products in the assortment of retail chains for each type of goods should be made in Russia, says State Duma deputy from the Just Russia faction, Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. For other product groups that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers, "Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the Fundamentals of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, which establish a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of products manufactured in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in retail chains is part of a package of stimulus measures for Russian producers.
Several times more domestic goods will appear on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to Sergei Litvinenko, a lawyer for the Nalogovik company and a member of the independent expert centre Public Duma, the effect on the Russian economy, as well as on the domestic agricultural and food industries, will be positive and will lead to growth.
Agricultural producers, farmers, and small shops will benefit.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will rise.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, expand some industries, develop some faster, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately, "the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to make their way onto the shelves of local stores because of high competition from their foreign counterparts.
Now, with the imposition of the embargo, that niche has been liberated and we can breathe a sigh of relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections, foodstuffs from Latin America, Turkey, and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, there is now a "moment of calm," when the old players have already left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "Tamara Kasyanova, Ph.D., First Vice President of the All-Russian Public Organization" Russian Club of Financial Directors, "said.
Undoubtedly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will help to secure the sector for local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that are cheaper because of subsidies from another country.
In other words, the battle for the buyer will unfold between companies operating under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are not able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of their compatriots in all respects.
And in this situation, retail chains will have to "reach" the share of Russian goods up to half of the assortment.
As a result, there are growing fears that substandard goods will reach the shelves.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied under the guise of Russian-made products, "the expert adds.
The negative impact of quotas will be felt by large retail chains, especially those that are better off cooperating with importers.
Logically, in this scenario, foreign suppliers themselves would suffer, as demand for their products would decline.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers as well.
The fact is that some Russian-made products may be inferior in quality to their imported counterparts, while stores will be able to inflate the prices of the latter as if they were a scarce commodity.
Economists started talking about the idea of import substitution, which had been forgotten in the early 2000s, again in February of this year, because of the relentless devaluation of the rouble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is intended to oblige retailers to take into account domestic producers when placing orders with suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the path of import substitution, and a system of production planning for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time, "Deputy Oleg Nilov says.
A quota mechanism would be particularly effective in those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, such as the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to cover the shelves of Russian stores completely.
In addition, meat production could receive a powerful boost.
As is well known, the largest share of imports remains for beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% is still accounted for by Russian products, "Kasyanova argues.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will promote import substitution and may accelerate this process.
However, this initiative by itself will not lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is convinced.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported, which means that full-fledged import substitution will not occur, but significant steps in this direction will be taken.
Moreover, it is not enough to set quotas, it is still necessary to establish domestic production in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas will provide just such guarantees, "the expert states.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that just 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
MAIL ON SUNDAY COMMENT: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers tracked the women's medical journey for seven years.
Dr Jordan said a woman's age at the time of diagnosis, ovarian cancer type, current illness and socioeconomic status also affected her chances of survival.
Older women and those with advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
Those who lived in regional or remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suggested that delayed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncology surgeons, and they are mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that more out-of-home services, which would allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and programs to support people receiving treatment far from home, could help.
Dr Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young Gold Coast mother Elisha Neave was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, in Kuzhenersky district, the doors of the new FAP will open
Construction of the medical facility in the village of Toktaibelyak began in April of this year and was carried out according to a standard project.
The cost of the works amounted to just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the medical and preventive facility built is almost 230 square meters.
Here, medical aid will be provided to residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaibelyak and the villages of Dementevo, Pyuncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelyak, Shinur and Chashkayal.
The new paramedic-obstetrical station will replace the existing Federal Medical Complex, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open in the near future.
Novocheboksarskaya woman who killed her four-month-old son while drunk will appear in court
A resident of Chuvashia will be in the dock for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary, the investigation of a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 of this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of her godmother's child in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the Novocheboksarka woman decided to stay as a guest and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up in the night and started crying, the drunk woman put him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
While sleeping, the woman fell over her son, causing him to die of asphyxiation.
The criminal case has been sent to court, reports the press service of the Investigative Committee for Chuvashia.
Inflation is out of control.
Will Russians Feel the Price Rise?
As a result of cross-sanctions between the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not meet the authorities "forecasts, VTB Capital analysts are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the Ministry of Economic Development's latest forecast, inflation will be 6.5-7.5% in 2014, and 6.5% next year or less.
However, according to Kommersant newspaper, this week the Ministry of Economic Development is expected to make "small but fundamental" corrections to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth in household incomes.
The forecast assumed that Russia's food sanctions would last for a year - until August 2015.
How, in such a situation, could inflation have been expected to be so high?
The current situation presupposes a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change, "stated the newspaper's source in the Ministry of Finance.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government's financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and forecast an 8% rise in prices in 2014.
The main effect of the food bans will come together with the possible introduction of a sales tax in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will fall in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflation results after the Russian Federation introduced "tidy sanctions."
I polled the experts and ascertained their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of Analytical Department, AForex:
Price increases are already being observed in major product segments.
Moreover, when socially important products became more expensive, the government was forced to put in place measures to monitor price stability systematically, in order to prevent the risk of unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers already report to regulators on a daily basis, so that authorities know exactly who is triggering price increases, when, and for what reason.
The key factors behind the rise in the consumer price index continue to be the colossal rate of capital outflows, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, domestic conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of foodstuffs from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures had remained under control, the cost of a basket of minimum products would not have jumped by 12% in the quarter alone.
The ban on the import of foodstuffs triggered a supply shock on the domestic market and led to an entirely logical increase in the final cost.
As we are currently unable to fully launch the import substitution mechanism, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to carry the risks of an inflationary component.
Add to that the fiscal reasons associated with a lack of confidence in the national currency and a worsening growth outlook, and inflation could well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the Analytical Department of Alpari
In the 1990 "s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, and at zero it was also higher than the current level, which was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think that by the end of the year, inflation will amount to 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, Asset Manager, Maguta Foundation Management Company
The external factor associated with the sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully contained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, primarily on the financial sector, it could lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually manifested in purchases of cash currency in order to secure their savings.
One can assume that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth depreciation of the ruble, both by market methods and state regulation.
But price growth traditionally begins after the summer lull and may become more pronounced this autumn.
The target rate of 7.5% for consumer inflation in Russia is likely to survive, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centers mourn decline in homeownership
Such a drop, driven by an exceptional fall in the number of homeowners under 35, could see gardening centres lose tens of millions of pounds a year as today's young consumers reach the "mainstream gardening age," according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, renters spend an average of 55 per cent of what homeowners spend on gardening.
It cites the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting courtyards in front of homes for parking, and the shrinking size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, which has an estimated annual sales of £5 billion.
Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, has the lowest spending per household on gardening goods in the UK.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said renting accommodation and a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser at the RHS, said: "Growing plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with renters who can transport plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of horticultural retailing as a result of rising home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.

Officially, Bulgaria's Ministry of Agriculture reported only the dismissal of Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
Lozana Vasileva took his place.
It turned out that two of the fund's three deputy executive directors had also been quietly replaced on Friday.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who was previously in charge of state aid and the SAPARD program, has been released, reports BGNES, with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I did not attend the Board of Governors of the Fund because, by law, we are not members of the Board of Governors, but I was later informed that I had been released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not reported on the foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I will find out more on Monday, "Angelova told the publication.
She will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatova, who was until now the head of "Investment Credit" at the central fund at "Agriculture" in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Agriculture Fund in the city of Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014.
Only Deputy Head of the Foundation, Atije Aliyeva-Veli, retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the agency are not mentioned.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spying report
Turkey's foreign ministry has summoned the country's most senior American diplomat to explain a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the American chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany's main intelligence agency had also targeted Ankara provoked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's biggest companies unite against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social media, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China's largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
But catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its US rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, behind, will not be easy.
Union of the largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will belong to Wanda and 15% to each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said in a statement.
It is planned to register the firm in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent, and Wanda's infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate properties throughout China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a movie studio and theme park in Qingdao, a city in eastern China on the banks of the Yellow Sea.
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the largest movie theater operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all of its shopping malls, hotels, and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by rival Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will head the new company, the merger will enable Wanda to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new platform should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dong Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract online shoppers to go to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupon services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest pie in online commerce," said Wanda CEO Wang Jianlin (quoted by Bloomberg).
"Right now, there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation, the odds are roughly equal for everyone," he said.
China's e-commerce market is the world's largest, and McKinsey & Co estimates that its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, according to official statistics cited by Bloomberg: this is more than the population of any country in the world, with the exception of India.
And, according to projections, that number could rise to 850 million by 2015.
Union of the richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huateng was until recently China's richest man, but according to Bloomberg's index of millionaires, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already overtaken him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu chief Robin Li now ranks third among China's richest people, while Wanda's Wang Jianlin is fourth.
"It's very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even wealthier," Cao Lei, director of the China E-Commerce Research Center in Hangzhou, told Bloomberg.
But he believes the new company is unlikely to compete seriously with Alibaba once it is established: "Rome cannot be built overnight."
That it is not easy to compete not only with Alibaba, but also with the established leaders of global e-commerce, is evidenced by the report released yesterday on Alibaba's financial results for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as somewhere between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than both of its US competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period is almost double that of its competitors combined - it nearly tripled year-on-year to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has huge potential to generate money, thanks largely to its mobile apps," an analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service told Bloomberg.
According to Alibaba's updated prospectus on the website of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, which is significantly higher than the figure in March (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba is yet to reveal the value of its shares ahead of the IPO.
According to the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the share sale.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place as early as September 16.
The company's road-show preceding this event will start on September 3.
Alibaba's IPO is expected to be the largest in the history of the NYSE and will allow the company to raise about $20 billion.
Until now, the record volume of funds raised on US exchanges belonged to the payment system Visa, which in 2008 conducted an initial public offering of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in retail chains should be of Russian origin, according to State Duma deputies.
They have drafted a bill to that effect.
The issue is the introduction of amendments to Article 8 of the Federal Law "On the Fundamentals of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, is that no less than 50 percent of domestically produced products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so a "discount" will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of all foodstuffs whose country of origin is Russia, Izvestia newspaper reports.
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law "On retail markets" was submitted to the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive farmers "markets in Russia, where small producers can sell their products.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvia municipal officials to Mallorca's public prosecutor's office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at Magaluf's notorious binge drinking centre.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been remanded in custody following corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvia municipal officials to Mallorca's anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish National Guard officers on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say government protectionism is seriously affecting their businesses.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," one businessman told the court.
Our livelihoods must not be put at risk.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British holidaymaker groping 24 men during a bar crawl.
The island's authorities have since been trying to stop drunken hooliganism among Magaluf holidaymakers by minimising the number of notorious alcohol runs in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club where the mint incident occurred was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Carnage bar race organisers were jointly fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the scene of numerous drunken accidents linked to the craze known as "balcony jumping," in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into a hotel pool.
First day of spring marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
Spring has brought a cold snap to southern South Australia, bringing torrential rain and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5mm of rain fell on the city by 9pm, following the 6.6mm that fell overnight on Sunday.
The latest rain was preceded by a couple of short downpours with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that began just before 8pm and dumped almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter delivered an early dose of spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delay of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7: 30 p.m., but hit a zone of wind shear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction at a short distance - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
Flight data showed the plane had to gain altitude on its second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8: 40 p.m.
The delay caused further delays to several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday, with a chance of one or two showers.
Calculation of estimates of construction projects in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control over issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks.
An expert council on the development of competition in the construction sector has been established under the FAS.
At his meeting, the Head of the Department for Control of Housing, Construction and Natural Resources of the FAS, Vadim Solovyev, stated that "today's calculation of the budget for construction projects is absolutely unclear."
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and may lead to an unreasonable construction price, according to the FAS.
And they suggest that the cost of construction of state-owned facilities at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices of design solutions, instead of the estimated norms and unit rates for technological operations currently applied.
These proposals have been included in the "road map" and are currently under consideration by the Ministry of Construction.
"The replacement of traditional cost estimates in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," Vadim Solovyev explained to RGB.
After all, now every bolt and nut is counted in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors" in the documentation.
The Ministry of Construction agrees with the FAS.
"The first achievements on the transition to the calculation of the cost of structural elements are already in place: methodologies have been developed for calculating the prices for structural solutions and making estimates according to these indicators," Elena Zhukova, Head of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction, told RGB.
Road construction has been chosen as a pilot project.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As Anatoly Demyanko, Head of the Profi-Invest construction company, told RGB, the estimated norms have been out of date for a long time, but no other mechanism has yet been offered to business.
"As for the proposed calculations on structural elements, in practice it is difficult to realize, because the construction of buildings often uses completely different technologies," he believes.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely thanks to government contracts.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, Chairman of the Board of the NGO Expert Community of Government Procurement Professionals, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director for Engineering at the branch capital construction center of Rosatom, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and companies that possess monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to enter this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is protected as much as possible from someone else's controlling influence.
At the Expert Council, it was proposed to form a system of state procurement in such a way that the same contractor is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion roubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of its impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case, it will be necessary to endow the client with the functions of general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of staff of the client and budgetary expenditures for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer's specialists will have to possess the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as its safety.
Often, such a breakdown will have to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to an outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to a lack of interest in receiving a state order for an incomplete amount of work and a small contract amount.
Alexander Evstashenkov, Deputy Head of the Expert-Consulting Center of the Procurement Institute, believes that now the procedure of state procurement has turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave an example: "when filling out an application, a participant should indicate" specific indicators "without the words:" or equivalent, "" should be, "" from, "" more than, "" less than, "" analogue, "" or, "" type, "" similar type, "" not lower than, "" lower than, "" higher than, "" may, "may have," may be, "" earlier than, "" not earlier than, "not higher than," not permitted, "etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem with FZ 44, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the participant's "paper" proposal at the application submission stage.
Considering the participant's application, it is really possible to assess only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of work that has not even begun to be performed, the expert believes.
The quality of work can be assessed only when it is accepted.
At the Expert Council, it was also proposed to shift marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon in order to eliminate interim contractors.
Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, Deputy Head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, as the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise it will turn out, as in Arkady Raikin's famous reprise of "The Atelier": "Are there any claims to the buttons?"
Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in territories near Gaza returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mortars rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in Gaza remained closed as the territory recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought joy and excitement to rocket-hit settlements in southern Israel, but traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel marks from walls and slides before the students arrived.
"We are a little scared, but we are excited about the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to get back to a normal life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said suddenly starting school again was "a bit weird."
"It was a difficult time and we didn't leave our houses at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the cease-fire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Sa'ad stayed indoors or fled their homes to safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, the settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are hesitant to return.
The Education Ministry said about a dozen families had still not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border that has struggled under Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said: "We will do everything possible to give you the knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately ended the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's airports and seaports.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of proximity talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war has killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, has carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 schools, which were converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands still in shelters and fighting continuing, education officials last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education like the children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a Gaza school.
According to a popular measure, property prices posted their biggest winter increase in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home value index for Australian capital city house prices rose 1.1 per cent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
That increase led to a combined increase of 4.2 percent for June, July, and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 per cent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not spread evenly across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne had a two-tier market.
Figures from RP Data show Sydney house prices have risen 16.1 per cent in the past year, while Melbourne has risen 11.7 per cent.
The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which experienced government spending cuts, with prices rising by just 1.4 per cent for the year.
Mr Lawless said that now that spring had begun, there would be an increase in the number of properties for sale over the next few months, which would be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the current high auction rate, the overall high sale rate and the current low interest rate environment, it is likely that house prices will rise further over the next three months," he said.
How people live in the oldest house in Ufa
In the former house of gold producers and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov at 57 / 1 October Revolution Street (formerly Bolshaya Kazanskaya) there are 18 apartments.
The 18th century house has hardly changed since it was built, except for its decay.
Strangers come here as if on a tour, and the residents suffer more than they rejoice from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Aleksandr Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is almost 300 years old.
The old courtyard, the always open door, the creaky staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls have cracked, and the street can be seen in the gaps from the exposed plaster.
Everything seems to be keeping to its word.
And the locals say: "You don't think so, that's the way it is."
Living in an 18th century wooden house is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of Apartment No. 3.
The object is on state conservation, but no money is allocated for its maintenance for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last renovation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poorly maintained, but the entire foundation is rotten.
Many residents still go outside to use the toilet and wash themselves once a week in the public bath.
How can one be satisfied in such conditions?!
The road runs right under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pulls back the curtain.
Now you can see what was only audible before: a stream of cars rumbling through the windows.
You see, the glass shakes constantly, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
One gets used to everything, to the good and the bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
Especially, we have two rooms, we live together with our son.
Conditions are much worse for other families, with ceilings just over a metre and a half high on the second floor.
For contrast, Tatiana suggests visiting a neighbor from Apartment No. 6, Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman offers a cup of coffee on the doorstep and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, so we live that way: my husband and I have a daughter and a granddaughter.
I have been here since I was born, there has never been any other living space, "Lyudmila looks around the room: a mezzanine, two sofas with the letter" d, "one of which is occupied by her granddaughter with a laptop.
Very cramped and differs little from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But the ceiling is leaking regularly: the plumbing system is nowhere to be seen.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment in a mundane and surprising way at the same time, like an Italian whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it brings together the very old and the recent, the everyday and the legendary:
The plumbing was installed about 40 years ago during the last renovation.
At the same time, they made us a small kitchen in the back room and a toilet from a former closet.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived, and servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The Ufa Real Estate Centre says that privatization does not matter.
Still, we will get only a one-room apartment, we cannot claim for more.
It was already four months ago that they promised to resettle us, but they didn't go further than that.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) a whole dynasty lived: my grandparents, my mum and dad, my husband and I, and my daughter and granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, hefty rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the outbuilding, they are a metre thick!
The solution is said to have been mixed with eggs, which is why it holds for so long.
The house has been built thoroughly, thanks to the Demidovs!
Perhaps that is why no one has been killed so far by a collapsed ceiling or pile.
Only the building is still slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house are rotting, the floors have repeatedly collapsed, we poured cement, but all to no avail - the mortar goes into the ground like a well.
They say so - there is a secret manhole under our room and a route to the Belaya River, which was specially made by the old believers who once lived here, so that they could take refuge from danger, in case of what.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them and begged them to let him start excavations in the apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give him a place to live in exchange for his one-room apartment on Oktyabrya Avenue.
Lyudmila refused the historian:
Where do the four of us go from here?
Here, there is even a tiny hope that they will provide more spacious housing.
If we had agreed to the exchange, we would not have won anything.
However, the Starostin family did not win anything.
Lyudmila's biggest dream is to be resettled and her daughter and 16-year-old granddaughter given a separate room.
That is, a two-room apartment was allocated for two families instead of the not-so-grand ruins in which two generations now live.
Cute, petite girl Olesya Karsakova from Apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two cramped rooms with a total area of 23 m ², called apartments, lives her extended family.
There are seven of us, two of us children.
You can see for yourself what the conditions are.
The plaster falls off in pieces, as do the window frames, and there are holes in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms.
The tap water is only cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, one can see that the Lavrentyev couple from Apartment No. 4 were the lucky ones.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the ground floor.
You are right, there is plenty of space!
The room is 75 square meters, three people are registered.
We live in the very rooms where Suvorov, according to legend, stayed during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family, Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high and spacious.
One thing is bad - everything around is cracking at the seams, falling apart, collapsing.
Neighbors, probably, have already told!
We suffer the most with the floors: the wooden planks have rotted, the ground has literally gone from under our feet.
I put up supports, wedges; there is nothing in the room, and in another room we walk like we swing, everything is so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell more about the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov than any tour guide.
He treats the gold miner as if he were his own, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, his personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansky plants built houses, cast cannons and bells, and kept the Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof as history.
I moved here as a child, in the 1940s, says Aleksandr Dmitrievich.
Back then, there were wooden carriage houses, stables and guard booths around, which were later demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something got in the way...
History repeated itself in 2014: again lured by new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, ran through the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
Officials did not accept the occupant.
Sent from one table to another, and then, as if in mockery, given a piece of paper without a signature and stamp: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of residents."
I even have a feeling that our house has not been in the city plan for a long time, because first it was number 57, then it became 57 A, and now it is 57 / 1.
As if it had already been demolished in the 1970s.
Russian Planet appealed to Vladimir Barabash, Head of the Information and Analytical Work Sector of the Land Resources Department of Ufa.
The house at 57 / 1 October Revolution Street is included in the program of resettlement of dilapidated housing.
I cannot be held responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the ancient buildings along October Revolution Street that are of architectural value - is being successfully implemented.
In the near future, it is planned to resettle the residents in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the restoration of Demidov's House will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now an architectural biennale is taking place in Italy, and the project "Staraya Ufa" is represented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016 the whole former Stara Kazanskaya Street will have been restored, says the official.
The houses will get a proper look, corresponding to what they used to be, three centuries ago.
Demidov's House is likely to become a museum open to all comers.
In addition, a decision has been made at the government level to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, there is too much traffic in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to resettle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be happy: their new apartments will be the same size as the current ones.
Only from a different era.
A forest fire has started in Primorye due to a thunderstorm
A dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire in the Okhotsky precinct forest district in the Pozharsky district of Primorsky Krai.
At the site of the fire, a build-up of forces and assets is underway.
According to information from the leadership of the Primorskaya Air Base, the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of the airbase:
The fire, which arose in difficult terrain, was detected by an observer pilot on board an AN-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Wood residues are burning on the old fire.
Severe overcrowding in the territory and a slope of more than 45 degrees, as well as the lack of landing sites suitable for fire fighters, create considerable difficulties in extinguishing the fires.
An MI-8 helicopter is needed.
The airbase's Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 fixed-wing aircraft have made the delivery of forces very difficult.
After the fire was detected, 4 parachutists-firefighters were promptly dropped off at the place of extinguishing the fire.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional firefighting forces and means.
In the vicinity of lunch, an additional 3 paratroopers were delivered by helicopter to the area of the village of Okhotichy.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be deployed to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the Primorsky Krai administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
But Henry had to work his way through some difficult childhood memories.
Since his mother's death, there has been "a lot" of treatment, and Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
It was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop making noise.
Get behind your sister.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of hitting in cricket.
I never spoke to him like that.
He was such an unsmiling guy in the corner who had been reading the newspaper for most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to take a look at what life must have been like for him.
It's a bit better now, but it's dark, smoky, the depths of the labyrinthine underworld with flashes of fire and smoke and a heap of soot.
My dad would get in the bath and just lie there and you'd hear him slowly start singing to himself because he wanted to get away from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn a living for us, and I began to appreciate him more.
Yet Henry emerged from a childhood devoid of parental love.
My father never hugged me, never said, "I love you."
It was only when my mum became unwell at the very end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billie, by Don French, allowed him to share the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why not be friends with her?
She's a great mum
They are still great friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why not be friends with Don?
She's a great mum.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got very, very well and started having diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You need to take radical action.
Then I started serious fitness training, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's change of career trajectory is perhaps reflected in his noble, short-trimmed beard.
Ever since he won critical acclaim for his Othello, he has been immersed in theatre.
Comedy of Errors followed, followed by Augusta Wilson's Fences.
This work is different from the sitcoms and comedies that have been an integral part of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and working in a factory.
The DJ noticed how he parodied on stage and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For quite a long time, I was the only black parody / comedian on television."
He was learning on the job.
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn to be an effective joke-delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working in television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Because his manager had the rights to "The Black and White Show," a light entertainment programme in which people "blackened their faces," Henry found himself performing in it for five years.
My family didn't really like it.
I kind of wish it had never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I was working on big stages and learning to work with the crowd.
But what was "an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody of black people."
Introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the Eighties.
The first season of "The Lenny Henry Show" aired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series "Chef!."
Advertisements, documentaries, TV series and film roles took up the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you going to do next, Len, because it feels a bit like you're taking your time or slowly turning aside."
Then there was a series of Radio 4 documentaries called What's Good About...?
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
I wasn't really taught it at school and I thought it was very much the preserve of middle-class white people with tights and a cabbage down the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the programme, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said: "You've got to try.
Don't curse it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words aloud, and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's final monologue for the documentary and was hooked.
I felt like I could do it.
It was as if my head had been straightened out.
"That's what it is, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough and I read the play for months and months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed." "
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said," You're going to have to work for 10 minutes while they fix the computer. ""
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else sort it out.
"You're in a play, stay in the role." "
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for "Fences" was difficult.
Panic is good enough, it strengthens the muscles.
It was well received, too, so it was like a sign from above saying, "This is what you have to do." "
He says this, of course, in a HUGE voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
Henry, by the way, still has a comedian's mind - all the way through our conversation, we are interrupted by flashes of his humour when he starts and ends parodies.
I just decided not to work in the stand-up because this thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you want to do it all the time, it can lead to a dead end.
I do Live at the Apollo sometimes when I want to, but mostly I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.
I ask if he will ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I love being an actor.
It's pleasant fun.
You're always telling a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government employees in an effort to remove "invisible workers" from the government payroll.
Employees who fail to register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to reduce corruption in state structures since coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month went missing through payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves government service, BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri reports from the capital, Nairobi.
All government employees are required to report within the next two weeks to identification centers to ensure that their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, a government statement said.
Anyone who fails to do so without a valid excuse will be struck off the payroll, it said.
"This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the civil service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government - hence putting an end to the problem of 'invisible workers'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary for planning and power structuring.
Dozens of Turkish Policemen Arrested in 'Conspiracy' Against Government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of "plotting against the government," local news agencies report.
Police officials did not immediately comment.
Among those detained were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved last December in a corruption probe targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and tapping a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (who was prime minister at the time) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Schools across much of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
The day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony did not take place in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the principal of the school in Slavyansk where Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the formidable leader it needs
Behind her is a trail of glory from the worlds of banking, media management and the inner workings of the Tory party.
Indeed, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world at Pearsons.
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years, stepping down when a senior position at Pearson's parent company was taken by a lower-ranking male colleague.
She is said to be earning close to £1 million.
Her political ratings are also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former head of BP, when he was trying to bring private-sector expertise to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory adviser.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's job a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex organisation at the heart of public life, but there is an inherent paradox in its structure.
The board has two orientations: inward as the top of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but outward as the voice of public anxiety and agitation when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs complete and radical reform.
But what new chairman would risk coming in, trampling over and destroying an institution as complex as China's dynasty, if he were to lose his job in the process.
This is a difficult decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC reduced in size - after a review of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow their horizons and new technologies challenge cosy old habits, the inevitable negotiations over the cost of the licence pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British have a stake in what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims its output reaches 96 per cent of households and costs each of them just 40p a day.
Moreover, it is clear that the Beeb's popularity is on the rise: 53 per cent support it today, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The BBC's viewing and use patterns have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programmes on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
It needs an impressive chairman - I hope it has found one.
Texas' Perry says derogatory tweet was written by someone else
A tweet from Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry's verified account on Sunday night included an offensive image of a Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal investigation for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, which disavowed the post.
A tweet has just been posted from my account that was written by someone else.
"I do not approve of this tweet and I have removed it," a later post said.
Perry aides did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who was actually posting to the feed.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering caricature of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry imposed a funding ban on her agency when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury hearing in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate.
The caption on the tweet reads: 'I don't always drive drunk at 3 times the legal blood alcohol limit... but when I do, I indict Governor Perry for telling me that.'
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge presiding over the case to dismiss the indictment, saying that the law used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas' history is vague and unconstitutional.
Perry withheld $7.5 million in state funds from the state's Public Accountability Office, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in Texas's public sector, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
The veto prompted an official complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group.
Perry's verified account feed is frequently updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might drop out by tweeting a photo of himself running near a lake and the words, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says property market back to 'normal'
One of London's most prominent property developers has warned that the property market in south-east England has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Homes in the capital have been the subject of buoyant demand and soaring prices, with widespread fears that a credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of upmarket construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from the peak of 2013," adding that this had provided a "stable working environment."
London's property market has fared well during the downturn, as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city have jumped by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, well ahead of the 6.7 per cent average for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for Berkeley's private, affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
But the strengthening pound in recent months has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and the political rhetoric surrounding a potential "mansion tax" ahead of next May's general election.
London estate agent Foxtons last week warned that April's mortgage market reform, which introduced tougher lending conditions, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in mortgage approvals in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another estate agent, has cut its forecast for London house price growth for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that property-price sentiment has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell by a quarter year on year in London's most expensive boroughs, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to agency WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital has proved hugely beneficial to Berkeley, lifting sales above £2.2bn.
Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right product with a good design and better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, forward sales have held up."
In June, the company said it sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - nearly a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £380m, with revenues up 18 per cent to £1.6bn.
Speaking on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said Berkeley's earnings guidance for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts' consensus is for full-year pre-tax profits of £450m
Berkeley shares were trading at £23.96 in afternoon London trading.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence released online by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been posted online by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" of photos of 100 other rising stars.
A rep for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence's photos are real, and condemned the hacker for a "brazen invasion of privacy."
Law enforcement has been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on photo-sharing site 4chan, are believed to have come from a flaw in Apple's iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalog" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is unclear how many of the photos are genuine, though "Scott Pilgrim vs. All" star Winstead also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those who look at the photos my husband and I took a few years ago in privacy at home - I hope you're proud of yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, from Nickolodeon's iCarly series and Victoria's Secret winner, denied that she was in the photos, writing on Twitter: 'These so-called nude photos of me are FAKE, people.
Let's stop this in its tracks. * pun intended *.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a rep for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos that purportedly show her are authentic.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J," which has won praise from critics
They dissolved, best of all, they gradually fell apart, like a cardboard box that had been left in the rain.
Only occasionally did the woman tell him that he was too serious, difficult to communicate, tense, closed, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritable.
He was prickly like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this prickliness was a little novel, from which he expected more than usual to escape from a lonely and dull life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembly fragile beauty with cracked hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and austere than Port Reuben.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, and the latter inherited a house in a damp but paradise-like valley called Paradise Valley.
No one has lived in the house for several years.
The pipes flowed, the spiders sat motionless in the baths, the slugs left their marks on all the windows, convinced that the house belonged to them; the garden was overgrown with weeds like giant cabbages.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, at once intimidating and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week
Kevern and Ailinn sat holding hands on broken deckchairs amid the tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they were both scattered on the cheap console that supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he remembered an old song by a long-forgotten black performer that his father liked to listen to as he lowered the house's curtains.
You have too big legs.
Because of their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
They weren't banned - nothing was actually banned - they just weren't played anymore.
They have been helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic."
Public taste did things that could never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among books people chose the memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, cooking books and love novels, they chose ballads from all the music.
Enjoying the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and, in a crude comic voice, sing Ailinn's big legs.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" from flying off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, he told him.
Start with a "J," forgetting to put two fingers to your mouth, and it will cost you a penny.
It wasn't much fun then, and it wasn't much fun now.
He knew what was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard him.
Jazz was not played, either, though it was not explicitly banned.
Improvisation has gone out of fashion.
There is only one "if" left in life.
When the tune began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
With wit, too.
His unpredictability worked on people's nerves.
And jazz was witty, expressed through music.
Although he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she could hardly remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was docile, which meant that each segment of society accepted gratitude - the gratitude of those who had been saved by fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent were temperamentally and physically well suited to entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, undertook to ensure that no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was plumbing; what was left of the Greek diaspora was beating plates.
People from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not leave the country quickly when WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED, happened, fearing they would be accused of fanning the flames, fearing, indeed, that the flames would devour them next, opened labneh and hookah restaurants, kept their heads down, and yearned for idleness.
To each according to his ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just sung to her could ever have been put to music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except, perhaps, for people with big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he adored the song.
He said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn didn't understand anyway.
How could your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers to his lips again.
She already found it odd.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief as Keverna closed her eyes.
There was nothing in the world but a lump of her sparkly black hair.
Nothing he would like to look at.
"Well, if you say that," she said, standing by her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankle, maybe a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
It didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts at a joke often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could soften the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be violent.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her deckchair, tipping over the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
Elderflower wine, so intoxication was no excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a blunt head," she said...
Although I don't like it.
He felt sorry for her, both because of the excessive rudeness of his words and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebuffed him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she was essentially like the rest of the world.
The same huge ocean of ice fell on both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, roamed from pub to pub in rage, ready to raise their hands to any woman who dared to refuse them or tease them.
Stupid head?
They would have shown her a blunt fist if she hadn't been careful!
First they would kiss - the kiss has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the salty ballads the console gave out is to kiss her first and then hit her.
An unnecessary clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already bullying.
Ailinn Solomons has shown that he needs to go.
He rose from the deckchair like an old man.
She felt the weight of his grief, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the upper window watched him leave, her companion a man who had borne the burden himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt an injection of compassion for him and the men in general, even if some of them were raising their hands to her.
The man who had turned his back on her, his back bent, shamed, embittered, his entire capacity for struggle deserted him - why did she think she knew it so well, when she could not recall a single occasion, until today, when she would have seen it?
Once again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years or so before the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, a clever and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked for Ofnow, the unofficial watchdog of public sentiment, produced a short report on the persistence of low- and medium-level violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline, if not stop altogether, given the resources and energy devoted to eradicating it.
"Much has been done, and much is being done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of a people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow crevices of the terrain, where, despite the soaring spires of churches, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
Some qualities, however, appear to be ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it engenders.
While people shed tears over sentimental ballads, swallow stories of obstacles overcome, and proclaim their fervent belief in the virtues of marriage and family life, not only does the old rudeness retain a strong grip in rural communities as well as in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new and vicious bullying is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads, and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," her supervisor said after reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no prejudices here.
We are servants of a society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, perfectly acceptable and laudable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "spiteful" and "rude" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to whine about WHAT HAPPENED, IF WHAT HAPPENED, as if it happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, flamingo-pink LED letters echoed advice Ofnow had given the country for the past quarter-century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, speak on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, a song is better than a written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when she made sure her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything other than that we haven't been cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
My concern is that if we are not prepared, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED.
Only this time, we will not throw our anger and mistrust at others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined his fingertips into a pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling the actions our grandfathers did or didn't do" mistakes.
You go too far when you say that they have vented their "anger" and "distrust" on "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, in understanding the past, that is, in defending the present, we do not speak of "us" and "them."
There were no "us" and no "others."
It was a time of turmoil - that's all we know.
"For which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to insert, "no section of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done was done.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - here we agree.
And just as no one should be blamed, no excuses should be made if it was appropriate or if something could be fixed.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past is there for us to forget.
If I can add one word to that -
Luther Rabinowitz's pyramid collapsed.
"I will review your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the pavement in what passers-by described as a "vicious rage."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho army says no coup planned; PM stays in South Africa
Lesotho's army denied plotting a coup to overthrow the government, saying it was acting against the police, who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he had received an assassination threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not really a coup, but that the army was responding to a threat from "political fanatics" whom the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements within the police force that do plan to arm some political, young political party fanatics who were ready to wreak havoc," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the army's actions looked like a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized power by force, by all accounts the actions of Lesotho's armed forces so far bear the hallmarks of a coup d'etat," he said.
Lesotho's army said the soldiers returned to their barracks Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing is running the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believed he was being attacked for trying to fight corruption in the country.
Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his united government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan at AC Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical.
He only made three appearances for the London club last season.
Recall that earlier, "Milan" rented from "Liverpool" striker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone output at 13-month low
Output growth in the eurozone slowed to a 13-month low in August, according to a popular survey.
The latest Markit Eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A reading above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed, and businesses have suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank's (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will be waiting for a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the stalled eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation running at just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi could give further signals later this week that he is contemplating a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"While some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers is becoming more apparent," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
Germany's manufacturing PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a real concern, as does Italy's decline from stable growth to stagnation.
Signs that growth momentum has waned in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add to confidence, "Mr Dobson said.
A slowdown in manufacturing is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts who expect additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August eurozone manufacturing PMI survey is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russia / Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries.
This heightened tension has obviously hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said it was "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to undertake some form of quantitative easing, "although we suspect that it will be limited."
Residents of Mariupol to put up a human chain against the militias
Everything was calm in Mariupol until last week - no one was eager to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now, residents await with horror the arrival of the "militias."
According to political analysts, separatists are breaking through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk, which was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics before, was recently captured.
The people of Mariupol decided that the Ukrainian army, though it would defend them, had few forces against the well-armed representatives of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics), and they were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city and stood there in a human chain, singing the Ukrainian national anthem.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and transport supplies and foodstuffs, collect medicines, and publish a newspaper.
Stores are gradually closing in the city, and banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten years of hell for Beslan survivors: Ten years since the horrific school siege, how the children trapped in it are still suffering
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death in the school atrocity
Exactly a decade after the horrific Beslan school siege that killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like the ultimate evil.
Tragedy united east and west in disgust, which miraculously then turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of immense grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the school atrocity.
We have found amazing young people who have stood up to adversity, even though memories of the terrorist inferno will live with them forever.
Their best hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now stop.
The girl pictured trying to climb back into the gym under fire
She was captured by a well-known Russian photographer, Dmitry Belyakov, trying to climb back into the gym in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Confused, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both had died, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to find my mum.
The soldier picked her up and carried her to safety.
After a string of surgeries, she thought she had made a full recovery, but yesterday said: "Three months ago the pain came back.
I fear I may need more surgery.
A few shrapnel remained in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it," she says defiantly.
'It's happened to me and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
'I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about my family later.
She says the capture stays with her, though memories fade a little each year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and around the world.
When I see a picture online of me climbing into a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure that it doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and he survived three days of capture by hugging his mother Tamara.
He was seven at the time and said: "Mum told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the child by the arm, and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said: 'Damir told me his mum had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her." "
In fact, Tamara broke free and was in hospital with leg injuries, thinking in turn that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said: 'I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (the now defunct News of the World), where he was awarded the Barnardo's Children's Defender by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that in my mind it is fading.
I remember immediately after that I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
'I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they are killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop where I was allowed to pick whatever I wanted and ride in an open top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of grief that he and his friends experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it
"I feel so sorry for all those who are suffering from these horrors," said Damir, who was volunteering at a nunnery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to serve in the police one day and hope to be admitted to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 children were killed in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?
I remember the eerie silence immediately after the capture, there were simply no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London wept as I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful "to Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I would like to call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shooting them with his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
It was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: 'I still think the world hasn't gotten better in 10 years.
Now there is a war going on in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They are just kids like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it is so sad.
Damir has grown up and become a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but they are very close to six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the sofa, turned away from us, for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other war toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get back on my feet, I looked around, I saw the hell around me with body parts lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him," Damir, run, run, "but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose shocking photo after the capture became the defining image of the tragedy in Beslan
Calm: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, and on the right is Georgy today
His bloodied face bore a mark of fear as he fled death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a senior doctor, took him to school on his first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not entirely alone, there was a family of our relatives there, but all of them were killed.
Only my Georgy survived.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of those days are always in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Heartbreaking: George's photograph (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and has been immortalised in a sculpture (right)
I remember George was so eager to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a statue of a weeping George in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this photo and it is hidden in the bookcase in our house.
I understand, but I also think that this photo makes people around the world feel our pain.
Georgy says now: "It's important that it never happens again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is heading for something very bad.
"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to pass before we forget it a bit.
It affected my health and I still feel it.
I had nightmares about three or four years ago because of the tackle, but now I feel better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to the gym before every September 1.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go in the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I will study to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Incredible: Georgy Farniyev was at the feet of a murderous terrorist when he was captured, but still managed to survive
At the time of the capture, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to study as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but was unable because of the damage to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I've left behind.
I'm older now and they say children easily cope with bad things - I have to say that's not true.
'I worked with psychologists in 2006 and I felt a bit better afterwards but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - the following year - it was the first and last time I walked into that gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in that famous photo.
Survivor: Georgy Farniyev today with an open photograph of himself in hospital after the siege on his laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with my knee, which was injured, but now I walk normally.
Still, my health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was not possible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I spent two years there.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: 'I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not something children should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: 'This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know George won't go.
For him, it has to be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan, the imprint is on everyone.
He remains with us.
George is now an adult, but that nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has had several surgeries, he can walk but cannot exercise.
I would say he has overcome this nightmare 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
That terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege, and this only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me and this is the best gift that God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart leapt out of my chest the moment I saw him in hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how is it that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If only we could capture all the rebels and throw them out as far as we could.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The baby who was movingly carried to safety by a special forces soldier
Saved: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no memory of the horrific crime
The world held its breath in 2004 when little Alyona was carried out of a captured school in Beslan in her arms by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina, and brother Mahar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, survived, but Alyona's mother and sister were killed in the carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a baby daughter, whom he named Kristina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alyona, now ten, remembers nothing of the seizure and has blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, neighbours say.
"They are a big happy family now and Alyona and Makhar are both lovely children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a wonderful father and wants to keep them away from all memories as the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can see why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned to Borussia Dortmund from Manchester United, said he was looking forward to getting back on the pitch in his German club uniform.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy to play for Borussia again, "Bild quotes Kagawa as saying.
I feel very good.
I'm full of positive emotions and looking forward to getting back on the pitch in a Borussia uniform.
Recall that Kagawa moved to MJ from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he failed to establish himself at the English club, making just 38 appearances in the English Championship over two seasons, scoring six goals and providing eight assists.
Man accused of running over girl at pelican crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will appear in court accused of running over a three-year-old girl at a pelican crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly knocked down the girl at Pittenwin Crossing in East Neuk.
Prosecutors said Mr Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit the girl, causing her injury.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the charge at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair QC set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Hollande won't settle down in Vladivostok
The Duty Free shop at Vladivostok airport posted a sign prohibiting a number of world political leaders from shopping at the store.
Don't cook them perfume, vodka and cognac.
The store's administration decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yuliya Tymoshenko, the Prime Minister of Japan, and several other well-known comrades would not be able to enjoy vodka, cognac, and perfume in their store.
And she put a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama was banned from an even less accessible institution, the MSU Dietetic Dining Rooms, according to the catering website.
Whether the American president ever cherished the dream of eating in a dietetic dining room in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the bans clearly seem awfully witty to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that, under the conditions of the embargo, Russian agrarians should master new technologies in order to establish the production of cheese varieties demanded by consumers.
The advice was given during a visit to the Yugptitseprom enterprise of Agrokomplex.
The Prime Minister also advised restaurateurs to reorient themselves to Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The year-long embargo on food imports was introduced in Russia on August 7.
Head coach of Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, taking into account the lack of purposeful preparation for the competitions.
Our athletes performed at their level, "All Sports" quotes Maslakov as saying.
Third place - confirmation of our rather high level of command.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be taken into account that we did not prepare for these competitions.
The season is over, and we did not commit our leaders to the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we came second in this tournament, but this season we have a new team.
The French, by contrast, put up a fighting team, including 13 European champions.
They have made no secret of their intention to win this year, as they have publicly announced many times.
But even such a line-up of hosts of competitions couldn't resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But results in some sports were orders of magnitude lower than in the same Diamond League.
The season is over.
Naturally, the result is no longer so important to the athletes, especially in competitions at the team level.
The most important thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to the point of absurdity, when in the 1500 meters the men got so carried away with the tactical intricacies of running that they showed a result below the average level... of women's races.
4 Tips for Getting Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to photograph or video underwater, there are a number of options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soapbox, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which sell for around $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a few cameras, all for about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules must be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Re-check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera's battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you're shooting.
Some cameras and camcorders have shooting modes or object types that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others for 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our Buyer's Guide and digital camera ratings for both conventional and waterproof models.
Shoot a few shots - because many of them won't work out.
Soap cameras have LCDs to help you compose your shots, whereas action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
So take a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial mode that shoots multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly the deeper you dive underwater.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more color in photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get closer to the subjects you're shooting.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it is even more important underwater because of the dim light conditions.
Particularly important if you shoot with an action camera: This equipment often has a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to get closer to your subjects if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze medalist of the Olympic Games of 2012 on free-style wrestling Bilyal Makhov can pass into Greco-Roman wrestling.
The head coach of the national team of Dagestan on free-style wrestling, Sazhid Sazhidov, reported about it.
The expert didn't rule out the participation of the athlete in the World Cup in Tashkent in September 2014.
Now Bilyal Makhov is on collecting a team of "classics," - R-Sport quotes Sazhid Sazhidov as saying.
In general, Bilyal performed in both styles on juniors.
On the youth championship of the world in 2005 he became the winner of tournament of freestylers and the third prize-winner in competitions of Greco-Roman and made the decision to concentrate on free-style wrestling.
Talk has long been going on that our heavyweight will carry out a new stage of his career in Greco-Roman wrestling.
I will say more: Makhov can already perform at the World Cup in Tashkent - if he wins the estimation.
But the final word is always with the coaching staff, headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the sort of man whose personality might shake things up, even in an organisation as gigantic as the NHS.
A consultant anaesthetist, he devoted his career to relieving patients of both the pain of illness and the agony of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that as long as doctors are preoccupied with diagnoses and illnesses, those being treated are primarily concerned with something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel normal," he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself angrily rebuking his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet went away on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague for a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray came.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to know the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos, a fibrous building material once called a "miracle," but now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be overlooked.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when a voluntary industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe fitters, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems a cause for concern today.
But such calm is a fallacy.
Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic.
Mesothelioma kills more people here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death toll of around 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from car accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are feeling its deadly effects now is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma pays no attention to class, wealth, occupation, or age.
The bastions of privilege, from trendy London department stores to private schools, have proved no salvation.
The Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are meant to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a pipe fitter.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he made up his mind.
"It seems there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years as a trainee," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors, and porters - used the tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who trained at Guy's Hospital and subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years," he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the only one who survived."
How many of us will get the disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17 this year.
To live so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
It is always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is due to end, some 90,000 people will die.
Most now have no idea that they will die this way.

A quick look at the reports from the courtrooms, where victims often turn for compensation, shows how far mesothelioma's scourge has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to inadvertently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked at the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs Allen was just 18 when she started at M & S.
She now has two children in their 20s.
"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
It never occurred to me that this would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They take their name from the word "asbestiform," which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found in buildings today.
It has been used in roofing panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler seams, even brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there are strong, if indirect, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in the UK]."

Janice Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a patient study that suggests that "a substantial percentage of mesotheliomas, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by environmental asbestos exposure."
Much of this impact, he says, is due to the "normal use and impact of the weather" on our buildings.
No one, it seems, can be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even at the heart of government, may have been unwittingly exposed.
In 2009, Goddard reported that service shafts and pipelines behind parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be driven by something as innocuous as "strong air currents."
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Parliamentary Maintenance Authority insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean sanitised certificate," it has now admitted that £1 billion worth of work needs to be done on refurbishing Parliament, upgrading the electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs may be sitting at the QE2 conference centre nearby, rather than on the green benches at Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules."
It is impossible to know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been found to have come into contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a GP.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he was struck by something that looked like flu.
He was 45 and in the middle of a late-night operation.
Suddenly, I began to feel feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn't be able to drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
In the end, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Baffled doctors took chest X-rays and placed pleural catheters to drain fluid from the lungs and send it for tests.
Yet his condition went undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was exercising and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients showed up at his waiting room with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The link in this case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his consultant showed his CT and X-ray results to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began feeling unwell, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.
I am an optimist.
I usually just move on, "he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott was immersed in meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where quite often there was asbestos insulation on the pipes," he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in those buildings are now getting the disease.
Thus mesothelioma now affects younger people in atypical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients were unlikely to be affected.
But many staff who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson did) or ate in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly indeed exposed to the toxic substance.
In the decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were a place where, in theory, patients "lives were saved, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Pupils put their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its amazing insulation and fire resistance.
Schools too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.
Across the country, in countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Websites have sprung up to draw attention to the asbestos problem in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, innocuous things like floor tiles or shed roofs typically contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings," said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful when demolishing garden sheds.
The impact of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"It takes quite a while to realise that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realised I had to go away and sort myself out.
Well, I won't see Christmas again
One of the hardest things was going from being a doctor to being a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information to be received.
"It was hard to comprehend everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor," How much time do I have? "
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't see Christmas again.
That's it. ""
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we sustain life - the act of breathing itself - that causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibres.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibres are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem comes from inhaling the needle fibres of asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he had been exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Trevor knew Lawson and treated some others who may have been exposed while training at the hospital.
When the asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, says Treger, "breathing pushes them to the periphery, where the lining is.
This is essentially an invasive process from the outset.
Conventional treatments for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it's worth trying.
Treger disagrees.
"You can't cut out the pleura," he says.
You can't go around it with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very well suited to chemotherapy," which "works" but does not cure.
"From time to time, there are patients who live a long time," says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
The writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he fell ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a one-man support and advice bureau for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he would say cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed four years ago and is still very energetic.
Abbott was initially offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would have taken four months and extended his life by just a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "managed to put a slightly more positive spin on everything."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunski, professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a referral, I just called them and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to be referred and approved for funding.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to get the best available treatments.
But when such treatments eventually fail, many sufferers face another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they turn to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960 "s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
That is when the companies "bad faith started to be talked about.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-cost settlement," according to Morgan, because Lawson could not prove conclusively that his mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
After the inquest into his death, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital did confirm, however, that "the asbestos in the basement areas in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, tying lethal asbestos exposure to one company or workplace - usually decades later - has proven to be a big problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed down.
Insurance records could have been lost.
And those defending themselves against lawsuits know that time is on their side, which the plaintiffs certainly do not.
In response, this year saw major new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
The legislation created a £350m fund, funded by the insurance industry, for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients would receive 80 per cent of the amount that a court could award in a normal compensation case - around £120,000.
About 300 successful claims under the scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma sufferers, believes that £350m represents a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the amount amounts to a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not intervened so that mesothelioma sufferers could track down the companies and sue in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Work and Pensions Secretary, admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven people dying every day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help now," Penning said during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a three-pronged treatment in which Lange-Lazdunski boasts a full 40 per cent survival rate in five years.
Abbott felt energized.
"It's certainly one of the most important things," Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is some power that keeps you going.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March [2014].
There were a few spots [of cancer] in my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
It's not life threatening.
It's the end of life.
Once again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no sign of tumors.
But the process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things - finances when I die, for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.
When you get bad news, you become gloomy.
We need to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it is not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I would not live to see old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimmer of survival.
The disease carries with it (even as, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
Bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos cloth.
Asbestos fibres are used to strengthen pots and improve heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now a non-combustible cloth has been invented.
I saw wipes made of it smoldering in the fireplaces at banquets
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opening in Canada and South Africa, and soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal insulator for the steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Global asbestos production is rising to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statisticians at Prudential have identified premature deaths among those who work with asbestos and are therefore denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr William Cook testified that asbestos particles in her lungs were "undoubtedly the leading cause of death."
This is the first case of its kind.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, deny liability.
No compensation is paid.
During World War II, shipbuilding, one of the deadliest occupations in terms of asbestos exposure, flourished.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful health claim for asbestos exposure in the UK.
Global asbestos production is rising to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The Health and Safety Executive in Great Britain requires all contractors working with asbestos to obtain a licence.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is illegal in the UK.
All asbestos use is banned in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act passed in the UK.
A £350m compensation scheme has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
Global production is maintained at around 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
China's parliament decided Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision by the National People's Congress effectively allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It hasn't disappointed our expectations, but it's still infuriating," said legislator Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing a popular nomination for Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to elect a head of government by ballot beginning in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kong's people the right to vote directly; but the decision also makes clear that China's leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nominating committee tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision comes after a summer of some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years.
Behind much of Hong Kong's pro-democracy campaign is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial district unless Beijing guarantees genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid trouble with the authorities.
In an online statement, organizers said the movement "considered seizing the central district only as an exceptional measure, an action that can be taken only if all avenues of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other option.
It is with great regret that we report that all avenues of dialogue have now been exhausted, and that the takeover of the central district is certain to take place.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security was tightened Sunday at government headquarters with police and barricades.
Underlying the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of people from the mainland is intensifying competition in goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and free speech, are beginning to erode under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations are putting at risk business, Hong Kong's lifeblood.
"The protest they're talking about, it could cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long," said legislator Regina Yip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread concern that Hong Kong is spiraling out of control.
This is a perception that is harmful to investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days portraying Hong Kong democracy activists as saboteurs directed by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands turned out in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
American prom culture hits university life: Freshers offered private jet arrival
We are delighted to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first luxury travel service for current students.
The company also offers private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 transportation options to make the most of your time at university.
Mr Stewart also said the service had thought about safety.
This service is an ideal alternative for students, who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year's students get to university with minimum effort and maximum luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that because the service had just launched, no orders had yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering the service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students face tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it still hopes to find a market for the service.
Today's students are very different from those of 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticised the service as out of touch with reality.
Megan Dunn, NUS vice president for higher education, said: "This project seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of most students.
Many students starting university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis, with available financial support in the form of loans and grants failing to keep pace with skyrocketing spending on basic needs, before they even begin to think about pulling out thousands of pounds for something like a simple arrival at a hostel.
Feminists Raise Race and Police Behavior After Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those present raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender ahead of race when it came to advancing reproductive rights and income inequality.
But as tensions rose in the Midwest and drew national attention, Perez saw responses from white women that focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women soon after the August 9 shooting, personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts on Ferguson as a White Woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About Women's Oppression" came relatively late.
But for Perez, they represented a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privilege at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very emblematic of the crisis we're facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so racially charged, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For Corita Mitchell Ferguson, an English professor at Ohio State University, it laid bare the challenges black American women face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural realm.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how people of color are attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, almost always on the basis of the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
It took a white woman to corroborate the story to justify the lynching.
From Hattery's perspective, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists like Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to put all their eggs in a basket of voting rights for women, and voting rights for blacks were supposed to come later," Hattery said.
Looking back at things like this gives us a clear idea of why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do any good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to unite against lynching in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
For Mitchell, the rise of white feminists "responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to" catch up "with issues black women had dealt with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists who have this [traditional feminist] ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they take the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now beginning to understand what that means.
Noted white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown to post a scathing article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll demanding that white Americans take more part in protests about racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public polls - will lead the change," Steinem wrote.
While Steinem vouches for a more intersectional feminism that includes issues of race and gender, her comments about race in America still surprise some.
American Enterprise Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contradict her earlier criticism.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, "My Brother's Keeper," to help vulnerable black and Hispanic young men, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only issue pushing the frontier of traditional feminism.
After the US Border Patrol arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, immigration reform has come to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to portray the issue as important to women, she only had to share stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [male immigrants], the women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house 'with a pig' for sale
A photograph of a house for sale in Suffolk has been removed by estate agents after it was found to show a large pig relaxing in the living room.
On sale for £120,000, the detached one-bedroom house sits on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description featured a photograph of the living room of the house - which showed a pig with its head resting on a sofa.
Estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was posted in error and has since been deleted," a company spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom detached house."
Although the agency has removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was being sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost to Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round of the US Open, believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, reports Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How will you assess your results at this year's Grand Slam tournaments?
Of course, I am happy that I managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Right now, of course, I'm upset.
After all, I couldn't even reach the quarter-finals.
What goals do you set for yourself until the end of the season?
After a painful defeat, I have a huge motivation to reach a new level.
I've got a lot to work on and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year well.
The Asian tournament series starts in a couple of weeks.
Nikolai Valuev, a member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth Affairs, a former world champion, proposed to give bonuses when entering universities for complying with the GTO norms.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the standards for pull-ups, running and other exercises.
Recall that 12 subjects of Russia will begin to implement GTO norms on their territory from September 1.
I also suggested that schoolchildren who passed GTO should be given bonuses when entering higher education institutions, Valuev noted.
For example, they can add points to the Unified State Exam.
There are also proposals to give an extra day off to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
A new millionaire has appeared in the town of Harvey in South Wales after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in Perth's southwest, where one lucky person will take home almost $1.1 million from Saturday night's lottery draw.
A Harvey newsstand is taking gold in the grand prize draw for the second time in five years, with the last winning $1 million in November 2009.
But the lucky winner has yet to declare himself.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in the small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win might be a secret.
Eight WA winners celebrated winning the grand prize last month, marking the end of a successful few weeks for the state's players.
Last week, the Canning Vale player became one of August's five millionaires, following the couple's huge $7.5 million Belmont win just weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for twenty years and said the win gave them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
A Harvey millionaire brings the number of WA grand prize winners to 59 this year, with a total winnings of $85 million.
Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, Oleg Pluzhnikov, Deputy Director of the Ministry's Department, said at a round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show 2014.
The plan was drafted on behalf of the government, one of the main goals being to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September or the beginning of October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - there is already a plan for the development of gas-powered vehicles in Russia.
The plan (a copy of which Vedomosti has) is intended for 2014-2017.
Evaluation criteria for electric and hybrid vehicles will have to be developed and how to encourage the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles will have to be decided.
A report to the government outlining tax and customs measures to support electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a scheme of preferential lending and leasing will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of vehicles, stimulate localization, and create service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to introduce amendments to regulatory and legal acts to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (at parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities in the course of 2015 that they should also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - proposals for expanding public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade will include in the list of performance indicators for regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The electric vehicle market in Russia is still in its infancy - in 2013, around 100 electric vehicles were sold across the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was zeroed out, so sales will amount to approximately 500 units, predicts Andrei Pankov, Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia.
But even a fivefold increase does not make electric vehicles any noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles into Russia.
Renault is preparing to start imports - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Nicolas Remiz, Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships for Renault in Russia.
Most other manufacturers of electric vehicles have taken a wait-and-see attitude towards Russia.
Electric vehicles are also developed by Russian manufacturers - "GAZ," "GAZ," "but output is minuscule.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low because of the high cost of electric vehicles, admits AvtoVAZ Engineering Director Sergei Amanov, without state support, there will be no breakthrough in this segment....
The development of the Russian electric vehicle market, in addition to the high cost of cars (the electric vehicles sold in Russia are, on average, twice as expensive as those with internal combustion engines), is constrained by the underdevelopment of charging infrastructure (charging stations are few), sighs the General Director of Avtostat, Sergei Tselikov.
Because of the high cost and low rate of cost reduction, electric vehicles will remain a niche segment of the Russian market in the next 3-4 years, predicts Mikhail Podorozhansky, editor-in-chief of AvtoReview, and Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, by contrast, say some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian electric vehicle market has good prospects, the main thing is to give consumers confidence that "electric mobility" is real; this will be facilitated, in particular, by the emergence of new charging stations, emphasizes Wolfgang Schlimme, President of the BMW Group in Russia.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by the state-owned company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and soon there will be about 80 more.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of filling stations are underway with other regions as well.
According to the Director of the Department of Rosseti, Vladimir Sofin, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build filling stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: the small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a uniform standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, has no right to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so with regard to charging electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of an electric vehicle market in Russia is the reversal of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it and expanding the preferential list is being considered.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental one (the idea is being discussed and concerns all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangibly as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, in contrast to, for example, Norway, where the tax cut led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles - they now account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as has already been done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the ability to move electric vehicles in dedicated lanes, which Russia does not yet have.
Private plane crashes in Colorado
The single-engine Piper PA-46 plane crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people inside were killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
Survivors were taken to hospital.
The accident happened a few kilometers from the runway at the airport in Denver.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In Donetsk Oblast, prisoners of the Donbass battalion are being dealt with.
The perpetrators were surrounded near Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces were killed under fire.
Survivors say that if they had known what the situation was in southeast Ukraine, they would not have gone to war.
108 captives can be called lucky.
Punishers from the Donbass battalion survived the "meat grinder" they were trapped in near Ilovaisk.
The militants spent several days surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, virtually abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When the headquarters reported that it was possible to leave the "ring" through an allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a few minutes later, shells and bullets whistled from all directions.
"Judging by the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the acting deputy commander of the battalion, who goes by the call sign "Lermontov."
And when we descended into the lowlands between Polypol and Chervonoselsky, cross-fire began from anti-tank guided missiles, "zushki," grenade launchers with 30-millimeter BMD automatic cannons, and small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three behind me; in the end, there were only two cars left.
An officer with the call sign "Lermontov" tells us that almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, and many died later.
Surviving militants are now being treated by those they came to kill.
Now the captives are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, provide them with food and medicine.
While their own commanders effectively deceived them and condemned them to certain death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
The column, the whole battalion, to destroy it.
Aleksei joined the Donbass battalion, like many of his comrades, as a volunteer, because the Ukrainian news reported on atrocities allegedly committed by "separatists" in the southeast.
Already here Alexei saw a very different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk - not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me and told me that there was a mortar attack, that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Aleksei.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not allowed to leave Ilovaisk, they said we were in a ring.
I had already reached an agreement with the commander, and I had already written a report on my departure.
We were immediately taken from Zurakhovo to Ilovaisk.
According to the captives, 300-350 people were stuck in the "cauldron" near Ilovaisk.
Now, some survivors admit that if time could be turned back, they would never have joined the punitive battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over by the militia to the DPR security forces.
Each will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
A headquarters for limiting food prices has been created in the region
A headquarters has been established in Krasnoyarsk Krai, which will, if necessary, limit the growth of food prices in the region's market.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The staff included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive and supervisory agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
Vesti Ekonomika - Will Kiev compensate Rosneft for $140 million in losses?
Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin says the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichansky oil refinery in Ukraine at $140 million
He said in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the Lisichansky oil refinery modernized by the company was planned for 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting there, there were no" entrenched rebels, "but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, process oil pumped into the pipes was lost, "he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansky oil refinery, an oil storage tank burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansky Oil Refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansky refinery is about 7 million tons of crude oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 standard fuel, as well as batches of Euro-5 standard diesel fuel.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichansky refinery were suspended due to its unprofitability.
It was decided to start repairs at the plant.
A year later, Rosneft acquired the Lisichansky refinery together with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, it happened at around 10: 30 am local time from the direction of Chagang province, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
As Interfax was told by the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, it is believed that the missile fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
Ruble falls amid geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose by 3 kopecks to 37.15 rubles at the opening, while the ruble declined against the dual-currency basket amid geopolitical tensions.
Trading on the ETC in dollars started with transactions in the range of 37.11-37.2 roubles / $1, the exchange rate was fixed at 37.16 roubles / $1 on average in two minutes, which is 4 kopecks higher than the level of the previous closing.
The euro exchange rate amounted to 48.79 roubles per euro, which is 3 kopecks higher than the level of the previous closing.
The price of the dual-currency basket added 3.5 kopecks and amounted to 42,395 roubles.
The US dollar is trading 23 kopecks higher than the official exchange rate, and the euro is 16 kopecks higher than the official exchange rate.
On Friday, August 29, the Russian market continued its rapid decline, but there was no panic this time.
The ruble continued to depreciate and even renewed its historic high against the dollar.
Now investors are already anticipating the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
For the time being, however, it looks more like artificial hysteria being fanned through the media, especially the Western media.
There are not many options for introducing new sanctions against Russia.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the rouble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical backdrop remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both Russian indices and the position of the national currency may correct.
"Orenburg Airlines" will sue "Ideal Tour"
Orenburg Airlines sued Ideal Tour for a total of 4.7 billion roubles.
These are two cases that will be heard in October.
The cases will be heard by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
Its amount is slightly more than 425 million roubles.
The hearing is scheduled for October 7.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
Its amount is 4.24 billion roubles.
The hearing is scheduled for October 2.
As journalists were informed by the Russian Union of Travel Industry, the judges assigned to the cases are different.
In July, information appeared in the media about Ideal Tour's debts to Orenburg Airlines in the amount of 1.5 billion roubles.
General Director of the airline, Viktor Zyukin, talks about the sum of 1.6 billion roubles.
Vitaly Savelyev, General Director of Aeroflot, calls the sum even higher - two billion roubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
Twitter, the microblogging service, has changed the user registration process in order to engage new members more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people abandoning their microblogs.
New Twitter users will now be able to browse a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration in order to immediately complete their reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of interests indicated during registration.
At the same time, Twitter automatically ticks the subscription box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually remove the ticks, so as not to read those who are not of interest to him.
Previously, users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, but now Twitter displays a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help form an impression of a person.
This is the biggest change to Twitter's registration page in three years.
Recently, Twitter has been working hard to modernize the service.
This activity is primarily related to the service's ongoing efforts to break even.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user growth and a decline in reader activity.
The company is now in desperate need of more loyal consumers who, once in, will stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be dry and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy all day long, meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow will range from 16 to 18 degrees, and in Moscow - from 13 to 18 degrees.
If the weather is cloudy and clear, there will be rain in places, and the wind in the eastern quarter will be quite light - only 3-8 meters per second.
Car scrappage program resumed on September 1
The car scrappage program resumes in Russia on September 1.
By December 31, 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, explained, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will apply to all vehicles older than six years.
The amount of compensation will range from 40 thousand roubles for a passenger car to 350 thousand roubles for a cargo vehicle.
Previously, a similar car scrappage programme had been in place in Russia.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is assumed not only that the cars will be scrapped in order to receive a subsequent discount, but also that if the car is more than six years old, it will be possible to buy a new one at a discount when the old one is handed over to a dealer in a "trade-in," Interfax reports.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which ran from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of light vehicles in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
Coming Out Simulator creator to release game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for Coming Out Simulator, has decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is only now widely known.
The game has been inspired by events in Ferguson, where protests are underway after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The project, which has not yet been named, will focus on how news coverage of stories affects their impact.
The hero of the game, a citizen journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between police and the public are taking place.
The hero can take different photos of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots a scene in which the police are portrayed as heroes and the protesters as thugs, the police will treat him better and let him go where the common man cannot.
If he reports events differently, his photos could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale riot.
Points in the game will need to be gained with the help of the hero's tweet, which will have new subscribers if the photos posted there prove popular.
The game does not yet have a title.
The release date and platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, posted an image showing how an event can change depending on how a photograph of it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite some time, but initially wanted to devote it not to the protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the region's history.
But when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game of it.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His best-known project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
The game, which recounts events from Case's own biography, focuses on how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his homophobic parents about his relationship.
Heletei draws Ukraine into bloodshed
With an appeal to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Heletey is drawing the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was paid to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Heletey, who stated that" the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists has been completed "and that the" Great Patriotic War "has begun, with the losses to be estimated at" tens of thousands. "
The degree of adequacy of the head of Ukraine's military department, who published the above-mentioned post on his Facebook page, is a subject for study by specialists not in the military field, "reads a statement from Russian diplomats.
They find it hard to believe that such statements can belong to the defense minister of a civilized state.
On Monday, Ukraine's defense minister wrote on his Facebook page: "The Russian side has already threatened several times through unofficial channels that, if resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he stated that "the operation to liberate eastern Ukraine" was completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all intimate photos of stars and apologized
Today, horror grips more than 60 Hollywood stars.
Hackers broke the primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) on smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
True, not for long.
Recall that the official representative of the star of "The Hunger Games" Jennifer Lawrence has already reported the theft of photos from her cell phone, and also confirmed that all the pictures that "shine" on the web are authentic.

I have not been contacted by their agents.
And now I will delete explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice, "the blogger wrote on Twitter.
However, all the explicit photos of the stars have already gone viral online.

It happened at a corner on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
The British footballer has recovered from a bruised and sprained right hand.

Tony Stewart crashes on return to track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than halfway through the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172, putting an end to his performance.
Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then exited without speaking to reporters.
His team principal Chad Johnston said the 14 crew members were upset but would now focus on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there had been a better try and a better finish for him," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll do better there.
Stewart first crashed into the wall earlier in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch that required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty high hope of finishing well," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded onto a tow truck and the crew gathered and were ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver while racing on a dirt track in upstate New York.
He decided to return this week, and he needed to win either in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work during the investigation into the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took to the track to voice his displeasure to Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
No decision has been made on whether Stewart will be charged.
The three-time champion was met with loud cheers and applause when he was introduced before the race.
Starting in 12th position, Stewart was in the top 10 at the start of the race, finishing fourth.
Then, on lap 122 after the restart, Busch's No.
18 car veered off the track at Turn 2 and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell behind to 21st place.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with Zhvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maksim Vitorgan are currently in Odessa, which the TV host did not fail to announce on her Instagram.
However, one photo very surprised and quite confused the couple's fans.
The photo was taken at Zhvanetsky's.
"At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhalych Zhvanetsky's house, Maxim explains what Instagram is:)) # odessa," Ksenia Sobchak captioned the photo.
But there is nothing on the table other than cigarettes.
No coffee, no rolls, no butter...
Fans of the couple decided that Ksusha also smoked, and condemned her for doing so.
"Whose cigarettes?," "Smoking kills!," "Some kind of cigarette breakfast)," "It seems to be at breakfast, but only cigarettes are on the table))," "Ksenia, do you smoke too?" - her blog subscribers were excited for their favorite.
Recall that Sobchak recently boasted about the delicious dinner that Maksim Vitorgan had prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the country house, and your husband has prepared dinner for your arrival (for the first time in their married life, but how tasty. The main thing is that now at the end of the dinner he will not say the words from the anecdote:" so that now it will be like this every day, "- Ksenia Sobchak boasted to her husband.
In the photo, Maksim can be seen diligently cooking something, while pickles and fried chicken are already served on the table.
Bulgaria's Prison Officers Hold National Protest

During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the previous working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Wage increases are also among the demands that will be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officers protested symbolically against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the old 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the trade union of prison officers has met repeatedly with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, reports Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are continuing, said Rosen Zhelyazkov, Head of the Main Department for the Execution of Penalties, BNR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest by the Prison Service Union.
The army controls Thailand's new government
General Prayuth (right) appointed Prawit Wongsuwan (left) as Minister of Defence
Thailand's military ruler and prime minister, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, has announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, in which more than a third of positions are held by retired generals or generals.
Representatives of the army were given key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs, and trade.
On Monday, Prayuth Chan-ocha was officially confirmed as prime minister after Thailand's king formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military, who seized power in a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed members of parliament.
Prayuth Chan-ocha said the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government.
Officially, Prayuth Chan-ocha will be the interim prime minister, as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
But there are fears that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military took power on May 22
amidst the total paralysis of civilian power.
Leaders of the main political parties have been temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, it temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army ousted Yingluck Shinawatra's brother Thaksin as prime minister.
Both are popular with the rural population, especially in the north, which has ensured their electoral success on more than one occasion.
But many middle-class and metropolitan elites joined the anti-government movement that has virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said mussels would be better in a salad, I didn't promise you that, jokes the waitress from the new Palm brasserie.
We have to admit formally that this is true, but our minds and stomachs remain steadfast.
After all, everyone has known for a long time: we say "Belgium" - meaning mussels; we say "mussels" - meaning "Belgium."
Restaurants like to make the profound point that the success of an establishment depends on three factors: location, location and, once again, location.
There are places that are not so well located, and even excellent, but some unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe called "Gorodok" (in honor of that TV show), then "Odessa-mama," and also a restaurant called "Beaujolais" and a beer hall called "Druzhba."
Now it's a beer hall again, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Above the ground, there is only the tip of the iceberg: a bar counter and a pair of tables, the rest of the space lacking even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, like in a children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-coloured chairs, instead of windows there are televisions where mermaids swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg are no longer new, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of draft beer (260-300 roubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottled beers (170-1550 roubles).
Companion-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that "mussels are rich big seeds," and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpectedly in execution.
Well, for example, who can predict that a meat roll with Walloon prunes (280 roubles) is actually a carpaccio, which is also so thinly sliced that parchment paper looks like an ugly thick cloth in comparison with it?
You can feel a taste only if you have half a plate at once.
Salads are even worse.
The classic Liege (260) would be best described as a crime against the Belgian people: some cured iceberg, potatoes boiled a long time ago, sour Kenyan beans, bacon chips, plus pickled onions for some reason.
You won't want to meet anyone with such a Liege salad!
The ingredients of the Belgian salad were somewhat different, but the impression was not positive either.
If it was still possible to turn a blind eye to unripened quarters of cherry tomatoes or over-fried mushrooms, why do mussels look as if they have been thawed and boiled several times in their lifetime?
After all, I already know that there are quite normal white sea mussels here!
They are served in pots "in a sauce of your choice" (490-560 roubles for 0.5 kg).
There were half a dozen sauces, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly not.
Vegetables are eaten, but there is no aroma, and whether there was wine remains a mystery.
But the mussels frites with homemade mayonnaise are good.
Chicken waterzoyu here is not a broth, thick to the point that depending on the mood you can decide whether the first or second course is in front of you, but just a nice creamy soup.
It was claimed that the rabbit was cooked in beer sauce by a local chef, and nothing was said about rosemary.
In reality, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposed: rosemary drowned everything out.
There was an impression that this rabbit was fed exclusively rosemary bushes during his life, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, the rabbit leg was accompanied by a wonderful - no, just an excellent pear in a caramelized crust.
Palm's waffles are not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be excessively watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager, who came to the table, took a very informal interest in the dining experience.
So it's worth coming again.
The dollar rose above 37 roubles on the news that the West is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
By 10: 29 Moscow time, the dollar rose by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 roubles, while the euro rose by 30 kopecks to 48.73 roubles, Moscow Exchange data show.
The bi-currency basket rose by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closing and cost 42.28 roubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a peak on February 19, 2009, when it cost 36.43 roubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was already 37,005 roubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House announced that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both against the euro and against the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, says Anna Bodrova, senior analyst at Alpari.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the course one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Rumors of a military incursion have not been confirmed by either side today, but the market has turned out to be very emotional.
Any talk that he was resistant to such news was quashed yesterday.
According to the expert's forecasts, the week will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, and the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.
Inflation is also forecast to accelerate, adding between 5% and 10% to current prices in the autumn.
Soon, moreover, seasonal fruit and vegetables will run out, leaving a vacuum as chains shift to other suppliers.
"The dollar approached the 37 rubles mark, passed it and came back, there is no strong hysteria," comments Konstantin Bushuev, Head of the Market Analysis Department at Otkritie Broker.
It will still be seen whether promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday as NATO meets.
According to him, the rouble weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, followed by news about Ukraine, moreover, the Central Bank announced last week that it would fully switch to a floating exchange rate by the end of the year and renounce any currency intervention.
If you look at the daily oscillation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, and it was the 37 roubles mark that scared everyone, "the analyst continues.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful has happened.
Worrying times for the currency market were, I will remind you, at the end of January, when there was an increased demand for currency, as well as on the third of March, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees a positive side to the ruble's weakening.
First of all, it is the growth of budget revenues from export operations, as well as improving the competitiveness of domestic producers through higher import costs, says Alexey Kozlov, chief analyst at UFS IC.
On the negative side, the price of imported goods and services has risen.
Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, become a reason for higher borrowing costs, which, in turn, hampers the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smooths out the decline in share prices expressed in rubles.
For example, the MICEX Index fell by 1.67% during Thursday's trading, while the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
This significant difference in the relative magnitude of the decline in the indices is explained by the weakening of the rouble by more than 1.5% during the day.
The weakening of the rouble is emotional and is explained by a massive rush to buy foreign currency.
Experience shows that emotions gradually fade away, and the rouble's quotations partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency close to the level of 36 roubles to the dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman has revealed she spent years thinking she was going to die after being misdiagnosed.
Karin Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tut's disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that cause nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
Charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure gait and squeezed toes.
Sufferers may experience numbness or pain, and the condition goes untreated and progresses, meaning symptoms intensify over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18 and die before she turned 30.
The mother-of-two, now 51, said: 'As a child I knew I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day and it took me longer to do everything.
I could never roller-skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied a lot at school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rodgers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at her medical records when her doctor left the room and it said she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where it shouldn't be, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about the condition in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and in the worst panic possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in between.
I was going through it on my own and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realised her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you would have been in a wheelchair already."
I think you have something that is far less life threatening.
After several genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I'd pulled out a lucky ticket," she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched CMT Awareness Month to try to raise awareness of the disease.
Tax burden on Washington-area entrepreneurs rises as economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and more jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country rose modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study released last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The state and local business tax burden increased 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years of shrinking bills in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, generates the least tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenue has been driven by a return to the previous level of company real estate values, researchers say, which has raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 percent.
While large states such as California, New York and Texas account for a large share of these revenues, the same seems to be happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase over the previous year.
But the observed rebound in real estate values has no similar effect on state and local tax revenue growth in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies "tax bills.
Virginia and the District of Columbia companies pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that don't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Thus, Maryland must rely much more on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services that other states have.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be fully attributed to the recovery in the real estate market.
Businessmen's incomes also seem to be on the mend, according to the data.
Companies in the region declared state corporate income taxes of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although trends are headed in the same direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three localities.
The District of Columbia grew at the same rate as the national average, 4.3 percent, while Maryland grew at a much faster rate, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia saw below-average tax revenue growth of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), at 6 percent.
Maryland's corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while the District's is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower state and local business taxes and a generally more favorable business tax climate than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in the study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia faces competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, the law could raise the business income tax rate to as much as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be feeling better, and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Business taxes paid in the form of individual income taxes by small business owners - the transitional structure that most small firms are organized under - in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than business taxes as a whole.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country is likely to continue this year, with sales tax revenues in state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
But the Washington area may lag behind, as lower federal spending affects the region's labor market.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home judo World Cup brought Russian national team two silver and seven bronze medals.
By this measure, the Russians lost only to the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, acting in the category up to 60 kg.
Thus in an equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia only one remark received by the Russian solved the outcome of opposition.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - three medals were won on Tuesday.
Mikhail Pulyaev got silver in the men's up to 66 kg category, and Kamal Khan-Magomedov got bronze.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the 2011 and 2013 world champion, Masashi Ebinuma of Japan.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot in the quarterfinals, triumphed in the consolation tournament and won the bronze medal.
Natalia Kuzyutina also reached the third step of the podium in the women's 52 kg tournament.
In the semi-final, she lost to the defending world champion, Majlinda Kelmendi of Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation in this championship and successfully defended her title.
In the dispute for bronze Kuzyutina won against Ma Yinan from China, but after the tournament ended she still admitted that third place is not what she hoped for.
Once again, Kelmendi, who had earlier beaten Kuzyutina in the final of the European Championships, became an obstacle to the Russian's path to gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov, who was fighting in the up to 73 kg category, put the bronze into the Russian team's moneybox.
In the quarterfinals, his offender was the former representative of Moldova, Viktor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the owner of an award.
Mogushkov competed in the home championships with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a break in the competition.
As for ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, Ivan Remarenko, who took sports citizenship of the United Arab Emirates, finished his performance in the 100 kg category with a bronze.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought Russians one bronze, which was won by Ivan Nifontov in the 81 kg category.
In the difficult battle of the small final, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmitt at the expense of his opponent's remark.
On Friday, three sets of medals were played at once at the tournament, but Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's up to 90 kg tournament.
Kirill Voprosov became its owner, and Team Russia was guaranteed this medal: his opponent in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However the fight itself didn't take place: Voprosov's rival couldn't come to a tatami because of an injury.
The men's bronze was also won by the hosts on the sixth day of the competition - it was added to the team's moneybox by Renat Saidov, who competed in the over 100 kg category.
In a consolation final, he secured a clean victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played out.
Both Russian national teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex were unlucky - they did not get a medal.
And here the Russian judoists won team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they lost in a persistent struggle with the score of 2-3 to the main favorites of the competition - the Japanese team.
Thus Russian national team led 2-0 after Khan-Magomedov's clean victory and Denis Yartsev's strong-willed victory (weight up to 73 kg).
However, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals in the heavier weight categories.
According to the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament developed, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost 2-3 to the Japanese.
The team competitions in Chelyabinsk were attended by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who after the tournament congratulated the men's team on the silver.
"Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions," Putin said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the ancestors of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I'm sure you can win against them.
Team Russia performed much better at the home World Cup than a year ago at competitions of a similar level held in Rio de Janeiro.
Back then, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
Thus the current tournament was skipped by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isayev.
We are all big maximalists, of course.
Yes, you want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person enters the Olympic cycle in the top eight, he or she is a potential winner of the Olympic Games.
Especially in a sport like judo, "the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko summed up the tournament, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
As expected, the Japanese team became the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various merit, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers' Family Hopes for Better
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from the illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after receiving an emergency call that she had gone into cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources said.
Doctors are deliberately keeping her under anesthesia and strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "serious."
The response has been overwhelming, including overwhelming online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All the Kings Can Do
On sale is the debut album of the band Royal Blood, the new hope of British rock, which has brought rock duos out of clubs and straight into stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo have only been on stage for a year, but already have a nomination for the BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour for Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room at a New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before its release, and the contract for its release is in the portfolio of major label Warner Music.
Given the current lamentable situation in the music market, the situation is extraordinary, because it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-voiced representative of the "new R'n'B," but about a duo of bullish-looking Brits playing with the level of volume and intensity that was last in vogue a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes for the first album were particularly high due to all of the above circumstances and have already been fully justified.
It is not for nothing that the duo have taken on a name that, until now, could only be encroached upon by desperate, hairy metalheads, and the blood of which kings, it seems to them, flows in their veins is also clear.
This is, of course, primarily about past Led Zeppelin heroes: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake the stagnant blood of British rock to new heights.
It is probably too early to make predictions about the success of this venture, but some things can already be said.
A dozen songs in just over thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal compositional talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the virtues of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: say, the pilot single, "Out Of The Black," is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not as a melodic line, but as a drum part.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is easier to tap than to sing.
Also noteworthy is the powerful "Little Monster" and the album's closing track, "Better Strangers," with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy rock fans, but when played in succession they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, or vice versa.
Royal Blood's strength lies in the fact that they do not claim to be the new Lennon and McCartney (rather they are being tagged as Motörhead's successors), but have brought numerous rock duos out of the indie club ghettos.
Their music, despite some variety, is made for stadiums, in a space designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously cramped.
The secret is partly in the ingenious use of bass, replacing the guitar in the familiar format invented in the early Zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about the instruments, but also about the approach to the composition of songs.
The heroes of the Zero retrorock struggled to get beyond the postmodern paradigm, and were extremely reluctant to recognize themselves not just as epigones, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood, on the other hand, already sounds so powerful and brazen that it successfully drapes some of the secondary and hardness of the musical material.
After all, who said rock had to be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported Friday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $US1.04 billion ($US970 million).
The news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion seemed complete, and that combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, aims to be a general streaming service - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time gaming," according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a genre of videos in which omniscients give (mostly old) games processing, as in "Mystery Theater," are already popular on YouTube.
After all, YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was greeted with little interest, a classic example of an entrenched technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through, given that it was reportedly prepared to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have at the moment is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another mystery, frankly, is Twitch's incredible success.
Snobs like me who claim that they would rather play sports than watch it, find it hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of picking up a joystick.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3am as she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch an outsider get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are designed for one person, so watching footage of them without controlling the angle of view on your own may be a Do It Right-worthy recipe for a headache.
I agree that the high-speed passes in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless he is a virtuoso of the game or of humor, his Twitch channel is unlikely to be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
Exactly how will Amazon make its money?
It's hard to imagine Twitch rolling into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could simply absorb Twitch.
Twitch, however, has what any company would love to have: hordes of young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the channel shows no signs of fading, even - oh - as a spectator sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed in a terrorist attack in 2004.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent several days in Beslan.
We talked with the survivors of the hostages - almost all of them are now students, with the parents of the victims, with Ramon Kaspolatov, the caretaker of the cemetery - the City of Angels, with Susanna Dudieva, the head of the Mothers of Beslan committee, and with Elizabeth Antonova, the correspondent of the Society department, who worked on the special project, who took part in the special operation.
Having already returned to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was the President's adviser for the North Caucasus and conducted negotiations with terrorists, as well as with Vyacheslav Bocharov, an officer of the "V" Directorate of the FSB of Russia. "
What particularly shocked me during my work on this topic was that it was as if Beslan had not had these ten years.
It is an extremely painful subject for anyone who has anything to do with it, people find it difficult to talk about what happened.
Impressions from the trip are very difficult.
But Beslan should not be forgotten, and I hope that we coped with our task, "Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographic studio of Rambler & Co holding, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's tenure in power.
North Korea launches short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan, Renhap reports.
The launch was carried out at around 10.30am local time from the direction of Chagang province, which straddles the border between North Korea and China.
The missile is believed to have landed in the Sea of Japan after flying about 220km, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
Deputies proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the law on personal data
In the event of the initiative's success, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
A draft law has been submitted to the State Duma, which provides for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on the personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is located in the legislative activity database of the lower house.
It was sponsored by State Duma deputies Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Just Russia), and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to faster and more effective enforcement of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and respect for the confidentiality of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is hastened by parliamentarians, requires the storage on the territory of the Russian Federation of personal data of Russians processed through the Internet.
It also requires the recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, updating and retrieval of personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as the indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right, on the basis of a court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of offending sites - an automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of subjects of personal data."
This law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin of the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of the CPRF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in Russia will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, Leonid Levin, First Deputy Head of the Duma Committee for Information Policy, said that he sees no problem in postponing the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own repositories of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation will be able to rent them, for example, "from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to lease their servers and are already providing their servers, from the Mail Group, from Western companies that are already providing their servers today."
"In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to operate in the Russian Federation, I don't see any problem - they will have the technological capacity to accommodate it," Levin concluded.
Controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that, if the bill were adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation - of the right to dispose of their own data, mandatorily determining that their recording, systematization, etc., should be provided only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism to inform the user about where his personal data is being recorded and systematized.
In this case, he will be able to choose on what territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the withdrawal of global services and significant economic losses.
Ice Bucket Challenge contestant dislocates her jaw
Isabelle Roberts, from the UK, screamed so much as icy water was poured over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman has been hospitalised after screaming so hard during a challenge with a bucket of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so violently as icy water was poured over her head that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold I was screaming but when I did my jaw started to get stuck," she told The Mirror.
Water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to close my mouth but it didn't close, it got stuck and then I realised something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old British woman has been taken to hospital to have her jaw repaired after taking part in a popular craze on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was posted thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militias handed over more than 400 captives to the Ukrainian military
The Army of Novorossiya claims to have shot down a Ukrainian Su-27, and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10: 00 a.m. on September 1, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead service personnel.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossiya.
He added that "air defense forces shot down a Su-27 aircraft near Mereshki, which violated the ceasefire agreement."
According to the agency's interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions when shelling Luhansk airport.
The representative of the press service noted that the militia managed to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters at one of the field airfields overnight, as well as destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The losses in the enemy's manpower - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered to captivity," the representative of the staff summed up.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, armed formations of the "people's republics" of Donbas announced the handover of 223 captured servicemen and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guard to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire.
At the same time, the DPR army, according to the Army of Novorossiya, "thwarted an attempt by the National Guard, in violation of earlier agreements, to withdraw heavy equipment from the encirclement area."
At that time, the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two infantry fighting vehicles, the capture of six tanks, and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy on all fronts (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, and more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian military personnel found themselves surrounded by militias near Ilovaisk in Donetsk Oblast.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian soldiers from encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy surrender its weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of troops began to leave encircled communities on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the encircled Ukrainian territorial defense battalion Donbass, Semyon Semenchenko, another 14 people emerged from the "cauldron" on Sunday night.
Semenchenko wrote on his Facebook page that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity at the 137th regiment of the 32nd division of the Russian Federation and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation," where they are being treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian MFA: Russia will take retaliatory measures if the EU introduces new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports the MFA of the Russian Federation.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the "conclusions" of the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on "absolutely unsubstantiated allegations about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country," the agency's website says.
The Russian MFA expresses regret that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, succumbs to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged "dialogue between the opposing parties," the agency emphasizes.
It is also noted on the agency's website that there are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, as well as a growing number of civilian casualties.
Recall that within the next seven days, the European Union plans to develop concrete proposals on sanctions against Russia.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with American officials.
They are supposed to be correlated with each other by duration and degree of stringency.
New EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sectors.
The Australian government has also announced expanded sanctions on Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Sophisticated ways to save on university textbooks
With the cost of university textbooks exceeding $1,000 a year for many students, Matt Schroeder, soon to be a sophomore, has come up with a cunning way to cut costs.
He developed a system for renting books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
"My math analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for last semester would have cost $430, he said.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have a range of options to reduce those costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
Renting books is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and is often significantly cheaper than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, says book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, said Trevor Meyer, Nibo's vice president.
Fewer than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introduction to the best ways to get a good deal.
Buying from an online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 on the list price, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Buying used
If you don't mind someone else's marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is selling for $93.49 in second-hand form on Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, said he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of "Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business."
The book was selling for $48 new.
Professors such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the "College Without Walls" at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, encourage students to check with their professors if they can use previous editions.
Sometimes updates are irrelevant to the classroom.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for second-hand book purchases.
Rent a car
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them well enough, don't forget to return them, and don't want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student could rent "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you pick up the books, including any fines you may be issued for tagging, underlining, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the penalties may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books, instead of traditional textbooks, are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by purchasing an electronic license for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Renting "Mathematical Analysis" on Chegg.com for six months costs about $61.
Bracey says literature students can often find the best prices, as many classics are now available for free download, while science and engineering literature can be very expensive.
No matter what, watch out.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using an ISBN number to price a book, as this ensures that you are looking for the right text.
Before ordering online, says Gault, be sure to check if the book is in stock.
It was not an easy lesson for him to learn.
Delivery of the book he had purchased was delayed by four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin says the Far East Development Fund is totally ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
"15 billion roubles remain in deposits," the President emphasized.
During the meeting, the Head of State instructed to accelerate the approval of the list of priority development areas in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, had still not approved the list of priority development areas in the Far East and their criteria by July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main objectives for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving the transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create the prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form areas of advanced development that should become competitive vis-à-vis the key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the President emphasized.
Earlier, it was reported that the territory of advanced development could replace the SEZ.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save box office
Sylvester Stallone's "Irresistible 3" returned less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Woman Worth Killing for" returned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
"Home Videos," starring Cameron Diaz, brought in only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films like "How to Train Your Dragon 2" also disappointed in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year ever for children's films, and called How To Train Your Dragon 2 a barely "functioning" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer release of at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day in May and July 20, for 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both moviegoers and film critics, suggest that this year's crop of films is similar in calibre to last year's hits.
Some commentators have suggested that changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of online streaming services such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-released Disney film Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We need to acknowledge that and not try to chase what happened before.
In contrast to the current drop in box office receipts in Hollywood, Netflix's revenue from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, nearly double last year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too much on comic book franchises and predicted Hollywood's "collapse."
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there was some truth in his gloomy predictions.
With several potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Altron, Minions, and Jurassic Park, other members of the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in box office receipts as simply "cyclical," telling the Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the highest-grossing summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not frighten owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for European and Japanese restaurants, Russian suppliers are a nightmare.
And, in general, the caterers still prefer to substitute banned imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"It's better to eat a cucumber with little salt than a bad mozzarella," laments Mariano Valerio, the chef at Barlotti, an Italian restaurant, about the quality of the cheeses offered to him by suppliers instead of Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ran out first at the restaurant, and they have a short shelf life.
Stocks of parmesan should last for another couple of months.
What to do?
Switch to Russian?
In 2005, I was at Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eye contact that it is clear that shocking memories still haunt him.
Meat was lying on carts just 30 centimetres from the floor!
There's cats, too!
Rats!
Then I said that we would never buy anything for our restaurant on Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe now everything has changed there.
But the other day, fish from the Far East was brought to me for testing.
So it turned out to be rotten!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of the things that are common in Italy for a Russian manufacturer are outlandish.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a cold chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It needs to hang off to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did it all with local beef.
Then they would ask me: where did you get such tender meat?
I said: this is yours, Russia!
Why does no one do that in your country?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti, in the French restaurant Brasserie Most, there is a stop-list in the kitchen that lists missing products: French oysters, sea urchin.
The chef of Brasserie Most restaurant and Strelka bar, Regis Triegel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses the restaurant will buy Swiss ones.
Regis, however, becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Cauliflower - 200 roubles!
I ask: "Why, on what grounds is it worth so much?"
I am told: "Well, we have to earn it, too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 roubles!
We buy oysters from the Far East by weight, but they live for 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their shell weighs?
At the price, it turns out to be a super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality plummeted."
The main complaints are that Russian suppliers cannot sustain stable calibre and quality.
Many European restaurants don't know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia's security, which are mainly called food sanctions.
Beef, pork, poultry meat and offal, delicacies of meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yoghurts, curd, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups are prohibited from entering the country.
Restaurants have started a scramble with suppliers: food prices have risen, and we urgently need to look for analogues from other countries.
Expensive mono-cuisine restaurants in France, Italy, and Spain, where products were delivered directly from their "parent" countries, will be hardest hit.
The catering industry has had to restructure before.
For example, when Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef in early 2014, and American and Canadian meat a year earlier.
In return, suppliers supplied beef from Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 were far more severe.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which exclude from the ban juvenile Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, peas and onions for planting.
Valerio, an Italian, hopes that the sanctions can be eased even further.
For now, some restaurants are in limbo.
According to the data of Vostok-Zapad, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Expensive restaurants will have to change menus to suit what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergei Mironov, restaurateur and owner of Restconsult agency.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such cooks, and it can take two to three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Most" is ready for this: he will have to give up 10-15% of the dishes, another half of the menu will have to be reworked.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine, dishes such as marbled beef steak are already being replaced by Befstroganov, says Sergei Mironov.
"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, and Chile," says Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of Vostok-Zapad.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of fruits and vegetables of European origin can be compensated for by products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it will be easier for budget chain restaurants to restructure than for the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who are able to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian went there.
Although it will be difficult for Ginza Project establishments, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace, "Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.
Owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European ones
But there are plenty of restaurants that will not be affected by the sanctions.
These include establishments with cuisine from CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in Georgian cuisine," says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafe "Vai me!."
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, many dishes are based on chicken fillet, and we do not use exotic greens. "
No dishes have yet been removed from the menu in Kolbay's establishments.
Timur Lansky, the owner of Chaikhona N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is also not embarrassed by the sanctions: he will only have to change lamb to New Zealand meat.
If Russia sets up imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even gain in price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, "he says.
It is possible to obtain tenderloin, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruits cheaper from the CIS.
Moreover, what is imported from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they are tasty and sweet.
No one talks like that about the Spanish.
Following the introduction of sanctions, representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of Uzbekistan, Olimboy Artykov, announced that he plans to double exports of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports to Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions.
Fast-food restaurants that responded to Money's request are also reacting rather calmly to the sanctions.
McDonald's press service stated that the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, Head of Supplier Relations at Subway Russia, the chain buys about 80% of its products in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, "sanctioned products" accounted for no more than 4%.
The sanctions also did not affect the noodle company Vokker.
KFC, Burger King and Tiny Kartoshka did not respond to Money's request, but other market participants claim that Burger King's degree of localization is significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are willing to buy Chilean fish rather than Russian Far Eastern fish
On His Hump
Meanwhile, restaurateurs complain that rising demand is driving up prices even for local produce.
"Prices have increased by an average of 10-15% for products for Grablei, and doubled for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio," says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya admits.
East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork," complains Sergei Rak, deputy general director of Stardogs.
Chicken nuggets have gone up in price by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool Brazil's hot heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Right now, it's very undesirable to raise prices, "Ruck said.
According to statistics, revenue growth in the food service industry for the second quarter of 2014 amounted to only 1.8%.
This is the lowest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how fast: so far, most restaurateurs have stocked up on groceries for the next two months, hoping to weather the price swings.
But no one knows what will happen in two months.
On the square in front of Moscow City Hall there are a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the stage, musicians are playing a waltz.
It is a festival of regional products with the cheerful title "There is time to eat."
"We had been planning to do a festival of local food for a long time, but then just the sanctions, we rushed, organized the festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, the Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad of macaroni and home-made sweets, the other day there was a master class on the preparation of borsch with caramelized apples.
Everything is made from Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents there is an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the Lenin State Farm near Moscow, cheeses from the crumpled Italian, Jay Klose.
"Salmon for restaurants can easily be replaced with other salmon from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, the owner of the fish shop "His People."
We catch salmon, keta, guinea pig, humpback, and chavycha - "king salmon."
Yes, they are not as fatty as Norwegian salmon, because they are wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it into your hands - it doesn't even move.
And you won't hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only establishments without special pretensions agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic one
Shrimp with the tag "Magadan," cod, omul, muksun, mussels from Crimea, scallops from the Far East lie in the display case of his tent.
Galkin is convinced that it is high time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 amounted to more than 4 million tons, with a significant part of the fish going to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Fish imports in 2013 amounted to about 800 thousand tons.
The "Your People" shop has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, and, before the introduction of sanctions, served a dozen other restaurants, such as "Simple Things."
Now Galkin has received applications from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, "he says.
We froze, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million roubles a month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per kilogram.
To prove it, a portion of "Philadelphia" with ketchup is being prepared for me in Galkin's tent.
Unlike salmon rolls, these have to be chewed for longer, but the awareness that this fish is our own gives us strength.
There are even halibut and perch rolls on the "Your People" website.
Sushi bars, however, prefer to replace Norwegian salmon with Chilean ones.
Galkin explains that chefs are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"We have not yet been offered Russian fish by our suppliers," explains the owner of Killfish Bar, Dmitry Evseev.
The situation is much the same with other products: Russian producers could fill the vacated niche, but this is not happening.
According to Boris Akimov, LavkaLavka's founder and co-owner, we can now talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace banned imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will primarily benefit large producers of other countries, "Akimov says.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass unscheduled inspections by Rospotrebnadzor, three McDonald's businesses in Moscow and two regional businesses in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the substance of the claims to determine the actions needed to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible," McDonald's press service told Money.
No one really understands what's going to happen next.
If it's limited to food sanctions, that's one option you can live with, "said an employee of a restaurant consulting company, speaking on condition of anonymity.
If McDonald's were to close nationwide, the scenario would be very different.
"Europrotocol" instead of a certificate from the traffic police
Payments on a helmet can be received without a certificate from the traffic police - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of "europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft instruction, according to which, starting from September 1 of this year, an insured motorist will be able to receive payments on a helmet without a certificate from the traffic police.
It is true, however, that this is only the case when the accident was processed according to the "euro protocol" without the involvement of the traffic police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in an accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit, and both drivers have reached an agreement on who is responsible for the accident.
From 2 August, the limit for payments under the "europrotocol" amounts to 50 thousand roubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad Oblasts, it will be raised to 400 thousand roubles.
The bottom line is that often, even in the case of minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be processed according to the "euro protocol," the drivers involved in the accident call the traffic police.
After all, it was impossible to get a refund on a Casco policy without a certificate from the traffic police.
The parameters set out in the draft directive are intended precisely to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the "europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payout on a helmet in connection with an accident, issued without traffic police officers, should not be lower than the limit under the "europrotocol."
But, at the same time, it cannot be higher than the limit set out in the contract of insurance of the Casco.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of relieving both traffic officers and roads.
But neither motorists nor insurers are likely to be enthused by it.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of an increase in fraud, which could result from the introduction of new rules on the payment of helmets.
As for drivers, it is hard to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome Russia's traditional conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait hours for an inspector to process a minor accident because it is so reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat the fraudsters or to convince drivers of the reliability of the "europrotocol."
The savings certificate will be made registered and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them the equivalent of irrevocable deposits.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban bearer savings certificates.
Recently, this instrument has gained popularity, because the rates are higher than those on bank deposits.
The point is that bearer savings certificates are not covered by the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank because it does not have to contribute to the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to DIA estimates, control 98% of the profile market, will suffer from it.
Moreover, the Bank of Moscow's share, according to the agency's calculations, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the DIA explains, is that customers of a small bank who have purchased such a certificate, in case of revocation of its license, try to get money from the DIA.
Some savers, lacking financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments on these certificates in case of revocation of the bank's license may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when holders of bearer certificates tried to recover insurance indemnity through the courts, "the DIA stated.
The problem is, of course, far-fetched.
After all, no one will pay buyers of certificates anyway, because they have no right to compensation from the state under the law.
If the issue were that the instrument was not insured by the DIA, metal accounts in which citizens "funds are recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium - would also be banned.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but their existence has not yet been compromised.
The point is most likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient security that can actually act as quasi-custodians.
At the same time, their movement is almost uncontrollable: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and before cashing out, such a certificate can be changed by many owners.
It is no accident that the draft law stipulates that a savings certificate must be a registered security, which must be kept in a depository.
And, in order to sweeten the pill for banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early repayment.
That is, the equivalent of the irrevocable deposit that bankers have long dreamed of is being introduced.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by those opposed to the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in Newport city centre for an anti-Nato march.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, around 150 people gathered outside Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit rally.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, ITAR-TASS reports on August 31, with reference to a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany will reportedly send 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made before the end of September.
In addition, a decision has been made to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On September 1, Mrs Merkel will deliver a government statement on the subject in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to "hot spots."
Opinions of the people of Germany on sending weapons to the Iraqis are divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop Islamic State fighters, while others fear that these weapons could end up in the hands of terrorists.
Militants shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk rebels shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this occurred in the Gulf of Taganrog near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezymennoe (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media outlets report the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is specified that the incident occurred today at about 16: 20 MSK.
Teens taken by helicopter from Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers have been airlifted to safety after spending the night stuck in the NSW Blue Mountains.
The 16-year-old girl and the 18-year-old man went hiking shortly after midday on Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called police at around 8pm when they failed to return home.
A search party, which included local police and a rescue team, was sent out and the pair were found around 11pm near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee and the young man fell and hurt his head.
Officers stayed with the pair overnight and they were winched out on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in a stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions meet
The high-level talks in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the leaders of the European Union met with the leaders of the future Eurasian Economic Union.
Albeit alarming (the situation around Ukraine cannot be delayed), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed for the first time a number of "hot issues."
Whether such a structure can work effectively is unclear; but it is clear who has taken the cream off this summit.
Questions in this respect disappeared on the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians, and then other Eurasians and Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenka on television news.
The Belarusian leader was an example of polished politeness, the behavior of a man who has just hit the jackpot - and is planning a dignified retirement in high society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of three major European commissioners (EU ministers), who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address a final briefing on their behalf, is not merely legitimizing a president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met face-to-face with Lukashenko gives grounds to believe that relations with the EU will continue to thaw," he told Ogonyok.
There is a hidden part of this iceberg: Belarusian authorities began preparing for a breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kyiv, in the summer of 2013.
"Results have also been achieved with the EU: successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization," lists the Ogonyok interlocutor, "and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The States even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction to them by the Belarusian leadership only spurred this process.
On the one hand, Minsk managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea's annexation to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in Donbas with the utmost severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian air base is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noticed Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are convinced.
How successful Lukashenko's move toward political diversification turns out to be will be seen by how often Minsk will be able to host meetings in the EU + CU format in the near future.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton, was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects from the relationship in the new format.
Ashton's press secretary, Maja Kosyancic, only told Ogonyok that this topic is not a priority against the background of resolving issues of war and peace.
At the same time, there have been reports that Kazakhstan may become the next venue for a meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of top officials in the new format.
The straw that broke the camel's back for Minsk was the statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he had been personally asked to do so by representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all sides are not opposed to Minsk remaining a central venue for meetings both in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that "Europe's last dictator" is gaining the status of a fully hands-on European leader who is helping to solve a global problem.
Europe's Farmer's Best Friend
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, led to the conclusion that the main reason for the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbas, but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the concerns of the CU countries on Ukraine's association agreement with the EU, which was drawn up at the meeting, looks more ambitious than the peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, indicated that EU representatives "came to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, not the other way around."
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine is also working for Belarus economically.
Its consequences - and, above all, mutual sanctions between the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still under sanctions pressure, much-awaited room for maneuver.
According to Yaroslav Romanchuk, Head of the Mises Research Center and former presidential candidate of Belarus, European investors are actively interested in Belarus "ability to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation, circumventing the sanctions.
At the same time, supply chains are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin scolded Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," Romanchuk emphasized to Ogonyok, "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have been working out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, for a long time, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian businesses desperately need to somehow restore them, even through the intermediary of Belarusian structures.
The second plot, the expert continues, is connected with the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to setting up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trading schemes may now be in high demand. "
According to Romanchuk, the role of host of the EU-CU negotiation platform is ideal for Lukashenko in terms of developing economic ties with Europe as well.
He recalls that losses to the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, while the European Commission has so far offered farmers only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president could propose that Brussels work together to minimize the impact on European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko's standing in the EU to an all-time high.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that official Minsk is disavowing its active role in the birth of the CU + EU format, and the Belarusian leader, at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, stressed that Kyiv was the initiator of the new format.
"It was your proposal to gather, to discuss without any bulk, not from the bay, to make a decision, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time," he addressed Petro Poroshenko in front of the cameras.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to appease Moscow, which is rumored to have initially opposed Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic service diligently emphasizes that Belarus does not pursue self-serving goals when organizing cooperation between the EU and the Customs Union on its soil, and the ultimate goal of such a format is the creation of a common economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in line with the concepts that the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, puts forward and promotes in other areas, particularly in the field of security," Ogonyok was told by the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, an agency that has been carefully choosing its words of late.
Toll-free zones may appear in Moscow
The Moscow City Government is considering the option of introducing toll entry zones as a method to combat congestion on central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, reports M24.ru, with reference to Deputy Mayor of Moscow for Transport Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has proven successful is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will certainly study it, look at all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that any decisions have been made in this regard, "Liksutov said.
The Deputy Mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and congestion to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the ongoing construction of a central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that all traffic does not have to pass through Moscow.
If there were sufficient bypass infrastructure, there would be no need to have transit traffic in Moscow, "noted the Deputy Mayor.
Maksim Liksutov also stated that the introduction of paid parking significantly relieved congestion on the streets of the capital.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop there.
Recall that on August 26, the Mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the first start-up complex of Moscow's Central Ring Road (TsKAD).
Boredom sinful
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City 2: A Woman Worth Killing for has not revolutionized the way one would expect it to.
The first Sin City (2005), shot with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comics, and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the thesis-antithesis-synthesis chain that is fundamental to modern thinking (meaning the noir universe by thesis, and the comics cosmos by antithesis).
From now on, it should read "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
Sin City 2 is chaotic on both a dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the characters are familiar from the first "City," though Marv (Mickey Rourke), I remember, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to snatch knives and other axes from the air in the role of such a folk band.
But the old people are literally elbowed by newcomers, as if they had broken into the city from some other film, the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry about.
Thus, the story, shamelessly cut off by the authors at the most interesting place, has a super-lucky gambler, Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Her own is with the lustful-frigid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and the vengeful Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight is, say, indistinguishable from Johnny - all the more so because the characters "faces, like other body parts, are swept away with inexorable regularity - is not trouble, not even half-trouble.
These are not people, but we understand that they are the archetypes of noir: the fateful bitch, the overconfident gambler, the "honey trap" sex detective, the corrupt senate ghoulish.
Well, and when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype chases, it is no longer a movie, but rather an abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the subject is simply ridiculous.
Moreover, even in this tumultuous world, there is something permanent.
The fighting whores of the first "City" still maintain a perimeter defense against the forces of darkness besieging their native slums.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan is gone, and there will be a glimpse of the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to look at.
The main problem with Sin City 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good at combining comics and noir as a graphic designer, and as a director at turning over the idea of how to bring comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposite "realities."
The comic book phenomenon in its modern form was born in the late 1920 "s, at the same time that Dashil Hammett's novels Blood Harvest (1929), The Maltese Falcon (1930), and The Glass Key (1931) created the canon of noir, then called hard-boiled school.
Well, or pulp fiction.
Comics have given Hollywood dozens of characters, from Popeye the spinach eater, Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy, to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, and other "Avengers."
But there was something defective about any comic-inspired film: the characters stubbornly did not want to be outgrown by onscreen flesh, and remained feigns in the "real" world surrounding them willy-nilly.
Simply put, they were utterly devoid of "existence."
Noir, by contrast, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with its experiences, characters, family scandals, and historical background - lost all credibility.
Which Forsytes, which Thibault and Rougon-Macquarie, which even Bolkonsky and Rostov are even conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz, and Hiroshima?
Such a novel mutated peacefully into a soap opera format, and a criminal - that is, by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned what it was like to be a front-line nurse.
He was a communist.
As, incidentally, were at least such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Losey, and Edward Dmitrik.
So the noir whose archetype they set is, first, crude and cynical, and, second, strictly social.
This is almost an American version of socialist realism.
The first Sin City was remarkable precisely because it unnaturally but organically combined comics with noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not shy of its graphic nature, rather than pretending to be a "real" film.
The gloom of a venal world, where a cardinal ordered murders and a senator covered up a monstrous sadistic son, was worthy of Hammett's pen.
And picturesque details like the severed heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Ellroy, the author of "The Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively nauseating - representative of neonuar.
Sin City 2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller-Rodriguez's radical stylistic style to the comic tradition.
Perhaps much of this is due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second Sin City, you feel like you are trapped in a glass ball, inside of which snow falls over a toy clown.
More often than not, though, it's not snow, but bloody bumps, but by and large, what's the difference?
But there is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere, we sometimes have a normal world, albeit on the edge of a dirty swamp, where it is possible to return a girl who has walked a crooked path or, say, to tell inconsolable parents that her killer has been punished.
When there is no room in the city of sin for anything but sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
Boring as any norm.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is simply boring.
To be fair, the domestic release gave this fresh sin a small but glove.
The credits warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person's fingers are broken with forceps, this smacks of hellish humour.
Hammett would have liked it.
France's Socialists must "shut up and put France in order," says Francois Hollande's key ally
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show warmth" to the embattled Socialist president, whose reshuffle was rejected by the vast majority of French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stand by him," he said, to applause.
In a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France's controversial 35-hour workweek, despite incendiary suggestions it should relax rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande implored his Socialist Party comrades to remain "united" with the government.
But Christian Tobira, the justice minister, put the wheels in motion by turning up at a gathering of dissenting Socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future."
Marine le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, has expressed disdain for the Socialists "constant infighting, saying she does not imagine the new Valls government will last more than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but so is Prince Manuel Valls, forced to assemble a new government when the old one did not survive the summer.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter either," Ms Le Pen told reporters.
She repeated her party's call for parliament to be dissolved, saying she was confident the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
France's ruling party suffered a rout in March's municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll by Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Cience Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"City Without Drugs" has been left without a lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the lawsuit of the Administrative Directorate of the Regional Ministry for State Property Management against the City Without Drugs Fund.
The agency intended to collect from the organization more than 7 million rubles in rent for a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
On two occasions, however, the complainant failed to appear in court.
Today, the Arbitration Court of the Sverdlovsk Region dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) against the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million roubles from the organization as payment for the lease of the building.
Today, it became known that the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice, which is why the decision to dismiss the case was taken.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the Directorate of the MUGISO could not be explained, the Head of the Legal Department, Maxim Titov, did not answer phone calls.
Representatives of the foundation could not be reached.
Recall that this is a mansion that has been occupied by the Foundation in the city center at 19 Belinsky Street, free of charge since 2011.
This decision was made by former Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to evict the foundation from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency demanded through the court to declare unconcluded a contract for the free use of the premises of the memorial mansion.
In the opinion of the Directorate of the MUGISO, the agreement did not include substantial terms for the lease of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim, then an appeal was filed with the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was granted.
Subsequently, the foundation filed an appeal with the same court against this decision, which was rejected, and the decision was appealed by the foundation to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court sided with the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was signed, according to which the Foundation started paying rent again, the head of the city, Evgeny Roizman, told about it.
The rent was fixed at 300 thousand roubles per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free use, recognizing our contribution to the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration decided differently, "he said.
Tatiana Drogayeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, United Russia deputy of Yekaterinburg City Duma Alexander Kosintsev proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the City Duma, Evgeny Roizman, to resign.
The reason was a criminal case against City Duma deputy Oleg Kinev, considered an associate of the mayor, who was arrested on suspicion of the murder of a pensioner.
How Evgeny Roizman's criminal case was found
On July 1, it became known that a criminal case had been opened for "libel" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) on the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Roizman.
This was reported by the Directorate General of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Sverdlovsk Region, where Anna Filatova, Director General of the Protection Center for Rights, appealed with a corresponding application.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog entries that she was involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The Mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is yet another attempt to avenge the truth."
The iPhone will be turned into a wallet
In the run-up to September 9, when Apple is due to unveil its new designs, more leaks are appearing in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
Citing sources, US media reports that the sixth generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project between Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re / code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, may announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which a mobile wallet function will be available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the checkout using a smartphone.
The payment will be authenticated by the user using his or her fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first to incorporate NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows you to make contactless payments using a smartphone and a corresponding reader at the till.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC feature was first introduced back in 2004 as part of a partnership between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors, and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote the technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC functionality, the Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay using an Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their retail outlets.
The French MFA: Paris "position on the supply of Mistrals to Russia does not change
The official representative of the French Foreign Ministry, Romain Nadal, announced Paris "unchanged position on the delivery of Mistral-class helicopter carriers to Russia.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde newspaper on 20 August:" Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a decision of Europeans, not of France, "RIA Novosti quotes Mr Nadal as saying.
Thus, the representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change in Paris "position on the implementation of this contract.
For more information on the supply of helicopter carriers to Russia, read the Ogonyok magazine material "Mistral is almost ours."
The National Security Council of Ukraine: seven servicemen were killed in the area of the military operation over the past 24 hours

Norwegian Cruise nears $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc., for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and affluent Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could still collapse.
Prestige Cruises "owner, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the talks are not public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises representatives did not respond to requests for comment, while an Apollo spokesman declined to comment.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that sail to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6 percent from the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
Companies are racing to position themselves as the cruise operators of choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with US regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's majority shareholder after an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists now, in 2000, through a merger with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting had a 28 percent stake, Apollo had a 20 percent stake, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP had an 8 percent stake in the company as of the end of June, according to records.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of North American cruise traffic, according to registration documents for Prestige Cruises' initial public offering.
Crimea TV and Radio Company may receive 250 mln. roubles in subsidies
The Ministry of Communications of Russia proposes to allocate 250 million roubles to the state television and radio broadcasting company Crimea in 2014.
As follows from the draft decree of the Ministry of Communications, posted on the unified portal for the disclosure of information on the preparation of regulatory acts, the subsidies are planned to be spent "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of a modern information space in the Republic of Crimea."
The money will also be used to buy equipment, repair the roof and power supply systems in the building of the television and radio company, founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Hong Kong democracy activists disrupt Chinese official's speech the day after election decision
A group of Beijing loyalists stood nearby waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday set out the procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to run in Hong Kong's 2017 leadership election.
All candidates must first win the support of a majority of the nominating committee, which is likely to be filled with Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has led democracy activists to renew their pledge to stop Hong Kong's financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document outlining China's control of Hong Kong in June, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business center and staged a sit-in.
Lee's briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and the China Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Rongshun, and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were also due to speak at a series of briefings throughout the day.
Student activists said they would gather outside Hong Kong's government headquarters in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land in the West Bank belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is motivated by a desire to avenge the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control over the West Bank.
According to Gaza spokesman Saeb Erekat, the world must hold Israel accountable for "ongoing settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem."
Putin demands Kiev start talks on eastern Ukraine's "statehood"
According to Russian news reports of his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start talks on the breakaway region's "statehood."
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region an opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
But Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was consistent with the obvious strategy he has pursued since the bloodshed began five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya de facto independence in order to draw closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin condemned Ukraine's military campaign to regain separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the seized territories Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that harks back to the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is a "prisoner of illusions," ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately start substantive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeast Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of a broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an effort to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in jeopardy.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
An intervention by a Kremlin spokesman to correct a "misinterpretation" of Putin's words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to deal with the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the overt seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have to endure a much tougher battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and pre-conflict polls showed widespread support for staying inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy for themselves, effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect Russia's main territory to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia's main military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic seaside resorts.
In the regions between Russia's Rostov region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories, and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers, after new elections, weigh constitutional amendments to give the breakaway regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his view of autonomy seems very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels that Moscow is accused of arming and instigating.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals follows fresh rebel advances last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This has entailed a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a steel port of 500,000 inhabitants that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a gathering of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit failed to act; the leaders called for the drafting of harsher sanctions against Russia to be imposed in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armor and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the beleaguered separatists, Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian incursion were exchanged Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said Sunday.
Nude photo scandal grips Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Jeffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and a host of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is in uproar after a series of explicit photos showing a nude Jennifer Lawrence were leaked online in a major celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible is said to have around 60 explicit photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michele, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Grecko are also alleged to have had their photos stolen in an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential: 'It's disgusting.'
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is appalling that personal information can be stolen and shared with others.
Grecko, who is in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hacking was "shameful" and that those targeted "feel like they have been invaded."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying by a nude pool.
Palmer's film credits include Love and Honor with Liam.
Palmer, "Chuck" star Strahovski and "Forbidden Reception" actress Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
A representative for Lawrence told TMZ: 'This is a brazen invasion of privacy.'
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone is actually no different from selling stolen goods."
Simply from a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photos cannot be tolerated.
Potential way to steal nude celebrity photos revealed
The massive hack of the stars' accounts may have been carried out through a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario was described by The Next Web.
On the resource Github was published a script in the language Python, which allowed you to collect passwords for the service Find My Phone of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of an iPhone.
It uses the same Apple ID login and password combination that was used to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script made it possible to learn the Find My Phone password by brute-force.
In this method, all possible combinations of characters are entered sequentially, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the Find My Phone service has an unlimited number of password options.
If the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and the user informed about the hacking attempt.
Because of the vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to match the password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp's Twitter account, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a script was written for it to find passwords.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and he noted that the aforementioned vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but noted that he has no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the account of "stars."
It's not me, plz RT
Once again, the Prime Minister's Twitter account has been hacked
Although there is no firm evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious activity using the service in the past.
Hackers intercepted control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that the security of the cloud was not compromised in this case, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter account of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also hacked earlier.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud in the manner described above, the password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web could not be reached for comment on Apple's vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin grants Russian citizenship to Ukrainian pentathlete
Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the well-known Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The relevant decree was published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and appealed to the Modern Pentathlon Federation with a request to give her the opportunity to compete for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won a silver medal at the European Championships in the individual competition and became world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
It retains the leading position in the current season as well.
According to the rules, in order to compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to obtain special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Ekaterina Lagno, a Lviv-born chess player who is a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), world champion in blitz (2010) and rapid chess (2014).
As a part of the Ukrainian women's team, the athlete won the Chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the World Team Championships in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championships in Warsaw (2013).
The TFR has stopped investigating the Tu-204 crash in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (ICR) has dropped a criminal case into the crash of a Red Wings Tu-204 airplane.
This was reported by the agency's press service.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the flight engineer.
Forensics showed that the cause of the crash was an increased approach speed, the crew's failure to comply with standard landing procedures, as well as the unintended output of engines at higher speeds of direct thrust.
A Red Wings Tu-204 flight from Prague to Moscow crashed on December 29, 2012, while landing at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.
The aircraft rolled over the runway and caught fire.
The aircraft commander, co-pilot and flight engineer died at the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to hospitals, where they later died of their injuries.
Three other flight attendants were hospitalized with serious injuries and received long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of a car travelling on the Kyiv highway at the time of the crash received serious bodily injuries.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the crash, the Transport Prosecutor's Office conducted a review of the Red Wings, which revealed numerous violations.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Aleksandr Emelyanenko began training in jail
A well-known Russian mixed-style fighter, 33-year-old Alexander Emelyanenko, who is in jail on charges of sexual assault against a housekeeper, has fully recovered from his injuries and started training.
Championship reports about it.
In May of this year, the Investigative Committee of Russia charged Alexander Yemelyanenko with rape.
The suspect was on the wanted list and was detained in Tambov on May 9 after a traffic accident in which he suffered a broken hip.
Emelyanenko Jr. was placed under arrest until August 31, and sentencing was scheduled for September 1.
However, the trial was postponed, and the investigation insisted on an extension of the detention period until 30 September.
If the athlete's guilt is proved, he faces up to six years in prison.
What's the power, brother?
Lenta.ru recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelyanenko's career
Emelyanenko carried out his last fight in January of this year, having lost by a technical knockout to compatriot Dmitry Sosnovsky.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Emelyanenko.
The latter is a four-time world champion in mixed martial arts, a four-time world champion and a seven-time Russian champion in combat sambo.
Anger turned out to be man's most universal and functional emotion
Angry facial expressions are biologically universal for humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in their creation is not accidental, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists in Australia and the United States have found.
Their findings were reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and can be summarized in a press release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Angry facial expressions - furrowed and lowered eyebrows, stretched lips, swollen nostrils - are the same in all cultures, and even born-blind children who have never seen it do so, notes the study's lead author, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion was created to effectively manage disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can inflict on another, the more power he has to dictate his terms, and he communicates this to his interlocutor through anger.
The researchers also found support for their other hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and turn to physical abuse, consider themselves entitled to impose disadvantageous conditions on others, and prefer violent methods of conflict resolution to peaceful ones.
Starting from the premise that anger is primarily an "emotion of bargaining," the researchers decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that produce angry facial expressions should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus force the interlocutor to agree to his terms as soon as possible to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated faces on a computer with or without each of the seven elements of an angry face, and showed them to the informants.
Although lowered eyebrows or an outstretched chin alone did not make the face angry, the study's participants unanimously agreed that a person with such traits was physically stronger.
Human anger, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of self-power that compels consent and submission.
A man inflates his nostrils and presses his lips for the same purpose as a frog that puffs itself up, or a baboon that shows off its fangs.
"Anger" is triggered by the interlocutor's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately assumes a form that best demonstrates to the other side the consequences of that refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry face are arbitrary, they all express the same thing, "anthropologist John Tooby noted.
The Ministry of Communications has offered to allocate 250 million roubles to the television and radio company "Crimea"
The Ministry of Communications has proposed to allocate 250 million roubles from the federal budget in 2014 to the autonomous non-profit organization Crimea Television and Radio Company.
This is stated in a draft government decree prepared by the agency, which has been reviewed by Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be used "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of a modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the purchase of equipment."
In particular, the allocated funds will be used to retrofit a hardware and studio unit, video walls, a central hardware and video server room.
Plans are also under way to acquire a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
In addition, the company will use the allocated funds to pay for the use of a fiber-optic communication line (VOLS) and the repair of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the limits of the federal budget allocated to the Ministry of Communications.
The state television and radio broadcasting company Crimea was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
Today, the television and radio broadcasting company's television signal coverage is more than 75 percent of the peninsula's territory.
In 2011, Crimea Television and Radio Company received a license to broadcast in digital format.
