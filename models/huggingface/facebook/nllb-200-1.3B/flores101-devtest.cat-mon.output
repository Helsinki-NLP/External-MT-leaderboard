below them are more medium-sized cats eating medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including wild domestic cats) that eat the smaller prey that is far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, locusts and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the nest, a special job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with the others.

Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals that they eat (prey) with their sense of smell, summing up the tracks they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. They hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then they go over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main and original group (for example, crossing a mountain range or a river, or either migrate to a new island and cannot return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.

The strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital supplies of military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements in the last two centuries.
Brittany mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering complete segments of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a response similar to their unrestricted submarine warfare.

The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise after the Revolution, the occupations were opened to all the men who requested it allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve it.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the army's statements on classes, from that moment on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.


At the top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.

The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of women merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd who shouted and chanted threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to bring the carriage windows fully open.
At one point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a murdered royal guard in Versailles to the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.

To understand the Templars one must understand the context that promoted the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is popularly known as the Full Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1,000 - 1,300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around the year 1500.


For example, one might say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.

n the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style.One of the major developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to button their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, that uses native stored seeds of the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.


Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical deficiency by the parents.
Wild children may have suffered childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, presents behaviors (always within some physical limits) almost completely equal to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference in relation to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the basics go a step further.
The bastida theory is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals who undergo a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.

Virtual bastides are built into the software and are designed to question, show, and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
children are taken in for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should be raised in an environment where they are not fed, loved and educated, but some do.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our host system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
It is supposed that the welcome confers all the needs that were not covered in the house where they were originally taken.
Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.

Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to assess honesty accurately.
He even suggests that these interpretative abilities of human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the whole of the variation heritage that is expressed.
segregación recombinación combinación de variación de regreso entre los dos patrimonios genéticos en cada generación.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
And failing to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to get would be the proteins that leaves and legumes provide us with, but unless they're cooked, these are hard to digest for primates like us humans.

though, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" the way savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back to sleep after a while (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easily done by using a low-noise alarm that makes you conscious but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you're the kind of person who resets the clock while you sleep, try putting it on the other end of the room, so you have to take it to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is correlated in an opposite way to the amount of tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find peace and full satisfaction.

It lasted for the next forty years and was fought in real terms, with delegated armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.

However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers entered and created fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral or multilateral treaties.

The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.

Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily dispose of milk, fur, meat and skin.
Goats were kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures, often watched over by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents. These methods of grazing are still used today.



This became a common practice, but the iron further worn out the wooden wheels of the wagons.
The first fully iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Its ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk straight as usual.

can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering that might exist in the future.
This only works as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should deactivate them.

The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most of the scientific research.
Well, experimentation isn't the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.

Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in absence of external signals. Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the virus DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the virus protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife of plants and animals.

In this dynamic vehicle everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows us today that this huge coal economy has triggered one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they fail every day? Is it that transport engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Transit Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.

To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) fullness, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This provides them with a wide variety of tiny places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the Spidey and the ephemeral.
