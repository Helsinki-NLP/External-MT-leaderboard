28-Year-Old Cook Found Dead in San Francisco Shopping Centre
The 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine someone who would like to cause him pain, noting: “At last, his affairs went well.”
The body found in Westfield Mole on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galizia, the court office of San Francisco Medical Examination said.

A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and suppressed” by his death.
“We are a small team that works as a friendly family and it will be very lacking,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galisia said Frank was first staying in the hostels, but recently, "At last, his affairs went well."
“He found an apartment, he met a girl,” Luis Galícia told KGO.
Louis Galisia said he can’t imagine someone who would like to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with the family was always to prepare a meal for us, to prepare a dinner for us,” said Luis Galícia.
He never wanted to be involved in any dispute.
He was a brother who was swimming.
“In spite of all the bad things that happen to this world, it was the unlimited diamond that brightly shines every day,” he said.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years.
The international group of biologists came to the conclusion that the most long-lived vertebral animal is the Greenland polar sharp, which can live about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radio-carbon analysis of the crystal of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The biggest sharp, the length of which exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that an important role in the longevity of the sharks plays low metabolism, which leads to slow development.
The females of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It was previously believed that the longest of all spinal animals lives the " neighbor" of the sharks - the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known by scientists was a little over 210 years old.

Should I go to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatory and residence rest is necessary not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In the conditions of the sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and get the doctor's recommendations on how to live so that his health is not damaged.
Such recommendations will not be excessive to anyone.
"Simply tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it should not be removed from it.
Permanent stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is experienced by about 90% of the visitors.
And it is most suffered by people from big cities aged 45 to 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people decrease their biological age while staying in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatories offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend the holidays with children, you won’t have to break with them.
For children, even the smallest, healing programs are provided, which include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, tests, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (in many sanatories there are children's swimming pools), inhalations, special diet, massage, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic bodybuilding.
The course of the procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, in the sanatories, a child club with animators normally works, where children can attend play classes, various master classes.
Some sanatories open their doors even for guests with babies, provide babies with the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced nurse.
Soft winter, prolonged summer, abundant sunny days per year (more than 300) create good conditions for a year-round vacation at the Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So you should not be afraid of the weather behind the window, especially that most procedures are carried out in the room and do not depend on the season at all.
In general, sanatorium and residential treatment is desirable to be performed 2 times a year, especially for adults.
The main fist of the Caucasian Mineral Water region, of course, therapeutic mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Esentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects the various systems of the body.
Water differs by temperature, quantity of salt, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's well-being.
Thus, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effect, restores the function of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Esentuchi-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the sugar level.
"Essentuki new" has an anti-inflammatory, diuretic and diuretic effect.
The same effects have Slavyanovskaya water.
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks less salted water because the salt retains the fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the appropriate amount and at a specific temperature.
There are also various cosmetic procedures available for the face and body.
What kinds of healing based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake of Tambukan, which is beneficial for the joints, the spine, the internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, disabling, immunomodulating effect.
This is a healthy walk on individually prepared routes.
They are popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral source "Narzan".
There you can also take wines, juice, yoghurt, selenium, salmon-lacrish, depending on what your doctor prescribes to you.
Continuing the fertility.
What to do to keep the harvest up to the end of the season?
It tells Julia Belochova, an agronom and dachnica.
It is time for high-growing tomatoes to arrange a cutting: remove new pins, cut the butterflies, remove all the leaves to the last cist with fruits and flowers with small bonds - they will not be able to mature.
All tomatoes regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and baklažans are fed with a gold-superphosphate extract, processed with biopharmaceuticals (Dozer - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactofite - from diseases, Immunocytophite - to increase immunity, Bitoxibacillin, Lepidocid, Fitoverm - if there are harmful substances).
From chemicals at the end of the summer, it is worth using only copper, colloid grape and green soap.
We make the last flour of plants.
The long-plate shells in the heater are scattered from the spaller so that the lower, naked part of the steel (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, swallowed with warm water and the Cirkon solution, swallowed the steel 5-7 cm of compost.
Extend the fertilization of the cabbage is also not easy: cut the old leaves, spray with warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, soften the fertile soil under the cage.
To protect against night colds, install a hole with cover material over the slope.
During the day, keep the plant open and close after the sunset.
Signs of end.
What indicates that Russia is out of the crisis?
The economists have seen signs of Russia’s withdrawal from the longest recession in the last twenty years.
According to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, GDP of the Russian Federation demonstrates a positive dynamic - in the second quarter GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual expression.
This is a minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest Rosstat data, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The stabilization of the situation has also recently been announced by the Central Bank and the Mineconomy Development.
The advance is slow growth.
According to experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
“The index assessment of the Russian GDP shows that the recession has remained behind, and the slow growth of the economy is ahead,” the bank’s bulletin “What Trends Say About” says.
The regulator’s specialists raised the modular GDP estimate for the current quarter to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the decline of GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonal cleansed decline of GDP was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But over the course of the quarter the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within the limits of 0-0,15", - citates the representative of the RIA MEP "Novosti".
The slowing rate of the Russian economy’s decline over the past five quarters indicates that “one has passed”.
Among other markers indicating the signs of revitalization of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the increase in demand for electricity and rail transport, the revitalization of business.
If you make an amendment to the fact that the year is high, it is clear that the dynamics in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
We will add to this lower average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of cargo transport, but it’s hard to get accurate data here, and the plus-minus of 0.5% of the semi-year volume can also be explained by seasonality,” Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER explains.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressure.
In July, the index of consumer prices was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month of last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks, Rosstat has fixed deflation.
In Russia, prices have dropped for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble rate, which, although showed strong fluctuations in the beginning of the year, according to the results of August from the beginning of the year strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which must be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko stressed.
In addition, the volume of industrial production in the Russian Federation has increased since April.
In June, the rate increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline of foreign trade is slowed from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics are also demonstrated by the situation on the labour market, where the unemployment rate has dropped to 5.4%.
Less it was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being situation on the labour market, the issue of the real available income of the population leaves to desire better.
In annual terms, the index decreases by 4.8%.
This factor may hinder the recovery of the economy, as household expenses make a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, as a risk factor for economic growth, we can also call the Bank of Russia’s strict policy.
The regulator keeps the rate at a level of 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is the insufficiently high investment level, which hinderes the development of industrial potential.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the economy of the Russian Federation will slow down to -0,5% against -3.7% in 2015", - says analyst of GC Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well lived in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, has not so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and ex-strangers, then in most cases it is about the descendants of countries - former Soviet republics.
But in Rio de Janeiro we can observe the reverse process – a large number of Russians stand under the flags of other states.
The history of change of citizenship is different.
Someone's parents were taken to another country in childhood without leaving a choice.
Someone did not stand the competition for a place in the Russian team.
And some believed that abroad will be created better conditions for development in the sport.
AIF.ru has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Rhodes.
She was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Only four years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go on the footsteps of her older sister - to engage in light athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with six.
If she remained in Russia, she’t be able to move from the throne Elena Isinbayev.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only landlord, though the former, in the jumping sector with the sixth.
Her best achievements in this form of sport are the 2010 European Championship bronze and the 2016 Continental Championship silver, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayev.
29-year-old Elena Pirzhkov was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelist direction.
Mostly because of their faith they left the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to struggle at school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado-Springs, where in the U.S. Training Center she continued classes under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izbojnikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first match.
The World Championship in the same year was a victory.
Before that, she, by the way, managed to win silver at the 2010 World Cup.
It was the bronze of 2013 and the silver of 2014.
Mary, 26 years old, was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first met synchronous swimming.
But saying that it was educated by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her lessons.
She soon joined the U.S. team and showed great results at the Pan-American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level for Russian synchronists it cannot compete, but for America its indicators are a roof.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Christina Shaldybin got at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue the training of the girl's art gymnastics outside the ocean.
Until then, the girl was engaged in the favorite sport in her motherland Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly entered the country’s youth team, and later became the main national team.
At the Pan-American Games, 19-year-old Christine won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she didn’t have to fight, but for the U.S. she organized a real breakthrough – brought the star-sized team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another our former "artist" is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the team of Germany.
Anna was born in Tolkien.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, indeed, Jana was able to occupy only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competition in personal primacy.
But two years before that, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the way of emigration of the previously mentioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
IRA is a educator of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the country champion.
Indeed, IRA is still trained in Russia – he comes specifically to his homeland so that he does not lose his skill.
In Rio, she was not as successful as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal multiplayer.
Information about the swimmer of Maria Ugolkowa in the Russian information space is extremely small.
For a very long time, Maria has lived and trained in Switzerland.
However, for a long time it was under the Russian flag, showing bad results - it was even the country's record at a distance of 200 meters by a batterfly.
In 2015, she obtained Swiss citizenship and began to stand under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance - 14th place in the comprehensive 4×100 staff.
To get into the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for preparation for the Olympics.
The 31-year-old free-style fighter Adam Batyrov spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the descendant of Hasawurt managed to become the three-time prizer of the European Championships, the champion of Russia, the master of sports of Russia of the international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from the sports bridges.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batyrov already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
About another former Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, in the homeland is known even less than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was quite small.
That’s where Michael started sports gymnastics.
He did not great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was the 40th place in the parallel brushing qualification.
But for New Zealand even getting into the Olympic Games in sports gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Nasta, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her classes of synchronous swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championship in Berlin, the girl ranked 6th in synchronous swimming.
In the duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, the 23-year-old Dmitry Crowter is playing for the Israeli team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry has already become the country champion.
In the same year he won the Youth World Championship.
A year later, Crowter won the gold of the youth Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to jumping in height, Dmitry is engaged in jumping in length and triple jumping.
31 year old Albert is another descendant of Hasawurt, who after long talks for Russia decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Baturov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Skills in Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 he even became the country champion.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the player of the Soviet Union for volleyball Yaroslav Antonov.
A year before his son was born, Yaroslav was recognised as the world’s best volley player.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze prize of the European Championship, which was held on the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and fell with his family in the hill of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it failed to get into this northern country - it had to travel to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn free struggle.
He soon won the world championship among the junior, and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the tournament.
And again the free struggle, and again the former Russians.
This time we will talk about the descent of North Osetia, who emigrated to Spain, - about Timurase Freev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently playing for the country's team.
Before that, the 30-year-old athlete was able to mark high results in Russia.
He became the bronze prize of the country championships in 2007 and 2008.
According to the Constitution of the United States of America, Timuraz has decided to change sports citizenship.
The last one in our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahachkale, - Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents brought his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began playing boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been the world champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he has become the world champion of youth.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the Pan-American Games gold, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why do Cossacks go to school?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, “the Kazakistan must be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically.”
They should grow and at least from 7 years to understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossacks.
But so far this work, I think, is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossacks take all the positive that has been accumulated before, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If all is flourished and unknown how, the new idea will turn to cheap populism.
HGH remains one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There are incidents on the funds allocated to the needs of the communal sphere from budgets of different levels.
According to the General Prosecutor's Office, exaggerated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of human rights.
As a result, the consumers of the region paid over to energy more than 170 million rubles.
In recent days, the Prosecutor's Office of the Krasnodar Region has revealed the facts of inclusion in the tariffs of unfounded costs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (provides cold water) were placed 4 million rubles. for car rental at a price above the market.
Examples in the country of masses.
The people give for the "communal" the last money, and pay correctly, according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate of payments from the population is 94%.
He is accused immediately by several articles of the Criminal Code: dismissal, legalization of income obtained by criminal means, abuse of powers, etc.
According to the version of the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov signed contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on it was actually not performed, but paid.
The businessmen simply returned most of the money.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
Makarov's scheme of machinations, unfortunately, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrest and detention of the UK leaders, who assigned the money of citizens, has passed through the country.
On Kamchatka, the trial is ongoing over A. Kohan, by the way, also a former deputy of the council, who is accused of machinery for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the version of the investigation, in 2012-2013, in Elizovo Kamchatsky County, he founded 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed consecutive work for the UK, the other two played the role of accounting and cash centers, i.e. received money from the population.
However, energyists A. Kohan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, the loved one.
It is quite difficult to judge in the field.
Things are not exciting, they are delayed.
And "help" in this extremely confused housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvoretneva, Executive Director of the NP "ZKH Control".
We fail to earn one law as we invent a new one that must force the previous one to work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, in the field of life.
The lawyers themselves acknowledge that the housing law in the universities is paid very little attention.
About the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings, the flaw in the course of the investigations is also spoken in the General Prosecutor's Office.
Of the 3,5 thousand crimes being prosecuted in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
According to the rest, the investigation took a delayed nature, and each fifth was suspended due to the failure to identify the accused.
Often the deficiencies in the activities of law enforcement bodies are recorded by them on the gap in the current legislation.
The law exists, but the intelligence bodies do not rush to raise and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were approximately 230 falsifications, with only 60 criminal cases being initiated.
In the last five months of this year, the number has only increased slightly – 99.
What is falsification of the meeting protocol?
This means: change of home management, financial and other issues go around the opinion of the owners.
And this also means that normal companies that want to work honestly cannot break into the market of housing and communal services, rather than “doe” the population.
It results in the residents in minus, small and medium-sized as well.
First of all through the eradication of corruption as such in the whole state, Anton Žarkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Affairs, is confident.
Now this work is being done actively.
It’s not just single actions, it’s a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not in all regions such a sad situation.
In the capital, scandals do not smell.
Why aren’t there such scandals in the field of human resources in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government has demonstrated iron will and ordered the order, - said the AIF Anatoly Electoral, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both personal issues, and legislative amendments, and legal education.
The management companies have been closely supervised, and all of them have passed through licensing.
The complaints of citizens are quickly resolved in the public space (and the addresses of residents, and the response measures are placed on the portal of the government of Moscow).
Many are not just paying monthly bills, but carefully monitoring what is written there, how the house is contained.
The awareness among the population about the rights of owners and obligations of resource suppliers and management organizations is very high.
Plus Moscow is checking the reasonability of tariffs on housing and municipal services - because a large part of the budget funds go on subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Per all this together explains the quiet situation in Moscow.
Is it all in the will of the regional authorities?
Per it is unwilling to change the workplace?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made the US ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic prophet accused of organizing a coup d'état.
He said this when he spoke to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged the Americans to refuse to support the “terrorist organization of fethullahists.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the division in the relations of Turkey with the West is increasing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO (Fethullahist Terrorist Organization).
Or organizing the FETO coup, or a democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice,” the Anatoly Agency quotes Erdogan’s appeal, which took place on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but already harderly, demanded the United States to comply with his demand, the first time after the oppression of the rebellion.
In the night of July 16th in Turkey, the high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army were attempted to overthrow the legitimate power in the country, and a attempt to kill the head of state was also committed.
However, after Erdogan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants were arrested.
A total of about 8,000 people were suspected, among whom, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
As Recep Erdogan believes, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the state revolt.
The United States denied all claims to its address, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The last statement of the State Department’s representatives on this account was at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey – he persistently insists on his own and also raises demands to other his Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to comply with its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels specifies the date of withdrawal of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” Turkey’s EU minister Omar Çelik said on August 9.
According to him, the introduction by Ankara of an anti-terrorist law, as the EU demands, will threaten Europe’s own security.
On 1 August, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel called on Turkey to stop the EU chantage by promising to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the corresponding statement of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement was made by Chavushoglu on Wednesday, assuming that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry has not excluded that the country will consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if it does not meet the expected support from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defense sphere - they will import missiles," Chavushoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to build its own defense system based on its own technology, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"Today, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have started looking for others," the minister said.
Experts believe that all this indicates serious disagreements between Turkey and the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute for Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Erdogan is now leading his game and cannot go to a harsh confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of bond to the West and from business and military point of view (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance whileining framework relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to see a completely obedient person on this post,” the expert explained.
According to him, it is not excluded that after the statements of the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensations, on the demand of a visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gülen from the United States) they will be pressing on him.
“Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press him on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governance of the country, and so on,” Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information, Aleksei Mukhin, assumes that the President of Turkey will change his point of view in his relations with Russia as soon as it will benefit him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan had an extremely harsh position towards Russia and in all ways sought charity in the West.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
The guarantee that after some time the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again is not.
I think Erdogan has entered the period of prime diplomacy.
Being between the two poles – the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself,” Mukhin said.
According to him, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he just needs Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States can stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus with Turkey will be achieved,” the expert says.
Another point of view is the head of Central Asia and the Middle East Anna Glasova.
Currently, Turkey’s relations with the EU and with the United States are quite tensioned, and this is linked primarily to the internal policy that Erdogan personally carries out.
I think this crisis in relations will worsen, and on the background of this crisis the Turkish leadership will try to reboot the policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is not an accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians say they are ready to change their position on a whole series of issues on Syria, the relations with Israel are settled, the active political interaction with Iran is ongoing,” Glazova explained, assuming that Erdogan’s next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now conducting is the return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
“It was then that, on the positions of zero problems with neighbors, Turkey began to very actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
Today, a very successful visit of the President of Turkey to Russia and African countries has passed.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey’s positions both in the regional and international arena,” the expert says.
Glasova believes that returning Turkey to its former relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, now the question is whether the EU will begin to respond rigorously to Turkey, which can go to the opening of borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
The kidnapping of young doctors: calls for new collective protests
Representatives of younger doctors appealed to the trade union with a request to sanction new collective protests in their dispute about the new labour contract.
The Committee of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is about to ask its full council to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
The younger doctors and medical students in July voted for the cancellation of the employment contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government continued to “resistantly silence” on the issues that, as she said, led to the abolition of the employment contract.
She said: “Given the current situation, the JDC chief voted for the rejection of the proposed new employment contract in full and called for official repeated talks on all your issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC leader today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve the continued programme of expanding collective protests, starting early September.
The dispute led to the fact that young doctors took part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA’s younger doctors leader, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting for the abolition of the agreed terms of employment that BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was good, which should be accepted during meetings ahead of the voting of 54,000 younger doctors and medical students.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said that this employment contract will be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: “The Alliance of Evil”?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to push their hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a stable impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handprint, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked tight, and he hardly radiated heat even according to his own shrinking standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, has repeatedly talked about his “dirty friend” to Mr. Putin – five times, according to one report.
I lost the account.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad ever happened.
His enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the delayed cooling from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow at that moment was untouchable.
Mr. Putin broke up with an angry thyroid, accusing Ankara of attacking Moscow on his back.
The insult was even stronger, based on the suspected friend.
Restoration of real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media had carried out a shocking, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it turned out that the Turks should be considered guilty in everything.
The most serious were the accusations from the senior leadership that Mr. Erdogan’s own family had engaged in illegal trade in oil from the areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it firmly.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move further.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received the excuse he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of announcing a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost dismissed from his post last month in a coup attempt.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
The Russian sanctions striked strongly – especially the charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number dropped sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will, of course, feel relief when the flights are finally renewed.
They are put at the peak at the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products will be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as it was said in a report in the newspaper Vedomosti.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil to the West because it considers it a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the sharp pace of talks about EU accession and the steps of Mr. Putin, who seeks to take advantage of the cooling and gradually destroy the Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support from the elected authorities after the attempt of a coup.
Remember, this is a fact for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of changing the regime.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described me as a “alliance of the evil”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West, unite forces.
However, despite the public show of reconciliation, these two still have substantial differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Per it tells itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they didn’t even touch the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the answer to the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and taking into account the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian reactive fighter – it is better that two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS should be reduced to the role of the back office, according to the executive director of the bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer loan brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship to international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come out on the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that will get more influence – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of customers and staff to Inverneshire.
He said to the BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be occupied because we are now becoming more and more a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I say now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is raising the profile of various brands in sponsorship of sports.
"This is the right time for us to move the bank brands as in the basis (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and would close all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of our customers and not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brands again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Detory has reached 3,000 winners with a victory in Newmarket on the Priestry
Detory brushes the champagne after a double in Newmarket leads it to 3,000 victories
Joey Frankie Detory achieved his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second night winner on his home road - on the Pristation trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Joker who reached this outstanding score in smooth leaks.
He follows Sir Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Piggot, Pete Idery and Willy Carson.
The three-time hockey champion Detory, who previously won Ghayyar, said, “This is something special.”
I am very excited because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, as it was here I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big world event, it’s not a Royal Ascot – it’s a regular Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am free of affairs and very untouchable.
Dettors are applying when they lead the predisposition after the victory
Two Jokes have achieved such a score in obstacles: Jokes champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories for a record career.
Leicester Piggot, nine-fold derby winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best Jokes of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached that mark that so few have reached to him.
He’s stylish and strong, but it’s his tactical milk that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma has attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Eps, he would bring 6000 winners if it wasn’t just a weekend joke and big leap!
And if seriously, Frankie brought the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character that’s good for British racing, but more than that, he’s an incredible Joker.
Frankie Detory celebrated this outstanding mark with a firm’s fast horse jump.
From fast finishes to fast jumping, Frankie Detory has been a symbol of British smooth jumping for two decades.
It was rise and fall.
A number of winners of the big leaks, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascott in 1996, but he also survived an air crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago, he first encountered difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed the enormous strength of will to challenge skeptics and return to shape.
And he may not have finished for a while — Detory said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in the competitions, at least until the age of 50.
Putin resigns head of administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly dismissed his head of administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted close circle for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed a representative for environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin says that Putin "have decided to release Ivanov from his duties as the head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not specify the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Weino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Weino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he was the head of the administration of the president’s protocol and the government’s apparatus, the Kremlin website (in Russian) reports.
During his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the heads of state in terms of drawing up laws and monitoring how your instructions are fulfilled.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to release him from this post and recommended that Weino replace him.
Are the smile convinced?
This was a move that confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov for a long time was one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As the head of the administration he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, the two men said that the head of the administration resigned on his own wish.
But despite the smile on the camera, it’s few who have convinced here – especially now, right before parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unforeseen consequences of any struggle for power?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement — that the person, who was once agitated as a potential president, suddenly wanted to govern the Russian environmental policy — was encountered with huge skepticism.
In Putin's comments quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "It's true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you in the conversation to entrust me this very difficult post, even, can be said, problematic post, for four years.
I was the head of the administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov entered office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, like Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which came to replace the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become the president of Russia after the second term of Putin, as the third term for Putin would contradict the constitution.
However, this post was occupied by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until he returned to the presidency after just three and a half years.
The star of "Think as a Criminal" Thomas Gibson is dismissed after a struggle with the producer
Gibson was a part of the shooting at the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative disagreements on the footage and differences in opinions.
I’m sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
Detailed information about how Gibson's character will be removed from the show that follows a team of FBI agents is expected to come later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously played the main role in the sitcom of Darma and Greg, was in the show from the first season in 2005.
“I love Thinking as a Criminal and I’ve put my heart and soul in it over the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement on Friday.
I hoped to be there until the end, but now it will not be possible.
I would just like to thank the screenwriters, producers, actors, our great team, and most importantly the best fans the show could only dream of.
The show is expected to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish Landed in the Bahn of Banfa
A man from Banfa asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sandwiches left by water.
Bane, living 500 meters from the sea, placed a picture of this spectacle in the Periscope in the hope that someone will be able to light the appearance of two-inch fish.
Quinsferry Crossing: The Bridge is now connected to Fifa
The $1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
The engineers have connected the northern spring and the viaduc of Queensferi Crossing—which means that the bridge is now connected to the Fifth.
This is the first of the four switches between the "weers of the plate", which are now approaching the completion near all three pilots of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fayf is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
The economy minister Kit Brown visited the square today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferi Crossing.
We are all witnessing the engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel are used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the sliding between the viaduc and the bridge plate is a virtuous operation with the use of extremely accurate assumptions for assembly.
In total, about 79 percent of the bridge plate is now on the site, for the last section of the plate, the concrete coating is floating in Rosayt today, meaning that all the plate is ready to climb to the site on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first shutdown on each bridge project is always a significant wave.
In this stunning project, this shrinking is the most modern construction art.
After installing the last section of the road plate and connecting it with the expanding road plate of the North Pillar, we then remained to close the remaining shadow on the north — or to the shore — side.
This was done by drawing the viaduc of the north approach to 700 millimeters south.
It was a large and at the same time very elegant operation.
Scale, because the 222 meters long Viaduk weighs about 6,000 tons and was to be lifted to the angle of inclination about 3%.
Great because the assumptions on which the team worked were small – just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in the Gulf of Moelfr: Three men 'drive to stay alive'
Three men were "trained to stay alive" after they were thrown out of a fishing vessel in England.
The rescue station Moelfre RNLI raised the alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday after the team saw the incident developing in the Gulf of Moelfre.
Three men tried to get to a safe place while their vessel continued to walk.
“We saw their vessel circulating next to them and supposed the worst,” said Moelfre Wins Jones.
“Fortunately, until we came down to the water, a strong wind took him away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued with the help of a local fishing vessel, and the third man, 60 years old, was found immobilized and stuck in a buzz without a rescue jacket.
They were all lifted to the coastal rescue and delivered to the rescue station.
Jones said, “Three men thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had an emergency switch, but it somehow disappeared from the man who managed the boat when it broke down.
Someone guarded these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a decent hunt for health and happiness
It is exciting to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching the screens, has been a complaint of many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go takes people out of the sofa and engages in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and recently to smartphones.
It is so nice to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I, of course, mean the falling enthusiasm, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which subsequently generated a series of cartoons, game cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all this lost its current relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was suspended due to a mass response that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, players with smartphones are going to look for Pokémon, which are traced by GPS and, being found, may be 'photographed' (through screenshots on your phone) or 'captured'.
The generation that played the game, as younger, joined the falling enthusiasm, withdrawing from the sofaes to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps that a "normal" person takes daily.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently the Washington Post that within two days from the launch of the game, the number of people followed that performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing in Pokémon Go, it’s just seeing the primary data about the passing levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes", "stay up from the sofa" and "be active every day" have not found a response because most health messages are boring and expressed by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out to do what they love.
Thus, three basic health principles are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on hunting.
As usual, there are boring troubles who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone can hit the door.
Well and what?
The breakthrough occurred.
After all, despite the fact that smartphones apps such as Fitbit could have previously tracked our physical activity, they didn’t give us a reason for the lessons that this game gives.
The new will come, and the use will weaken with time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people in the hunting to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Bailes wins the gold of absolute championship in female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the shame.
Simona Bailes is unhappy for all of this.
Dynamic on a support jump.
Unnecessary on the bridge.
Shaking on the floor.
Amazing everywhere.
And finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the title of the absolute champion on Thursday, placing a gap between herself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under the striking Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and team companion "Final Five" Ali Rysman and the Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafina.
Bailes from the United States performs on the gymnasium bridge during the final of the female individual absolute championship in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailes became the fourth in a row American woman winning the title of absolute champion and the fifth in general, consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation and possibly anytime.
She broke out when her final overall score was shown and her long journey to that moment ended.
This achievement puts her in the same league as the extremely rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who raised their sports to new heights:
Bailes has spent the last three years dominating in her form of sport, winning 15 world championship medals – including 10 gold – with such a spectacular program in their mix of labor and accuracy that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the greatest gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
One last test was awaited in Brazil, competition not as much between Bailes and the rest in this field as between it and the load of exaggerated expectations.
Nothing less than going back to your family’s house in Spring, Texas, with a lot of gold medals, would be seen as an unjustified expectation.
Simona Bailes from the United States, to the left, and Elie Rysman are hugged after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the female individual absolute championship in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Bayles earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final record for the farewell party with the resignation coordinator of the national team Martha Caroli.
While Bailes insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not exactly so.
Part of her free exercise program — which includes her firm passage — is set on Latin American music, which would come right as home on the street right outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
This is not coincidence.
The girl, whose grandmother and grandmother were a beginner of walking as a child and opened by the mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not lost any competition in the absolute championship since the summer of 2013 – a strip that must last as long as Bailes wants it.
Despite the fact that Mustafina received a small advantage with the help of two spins, it was a mirror.
The gymnastics and free exercises — where Bailes defends the title of world champion — are in place.
She went forward again with 15,433 on the bridge and ended with 15,933 on the floor.
Rysman mildly hugged her as they waited for the final account — pure formality — and tears appeared around the bright red with white and blue underwater for the eyes of Bailes when the idea she once recorded in the album for cutting was achieved.
Rysman's speech was a little revenge for what happened four years ago when she divided the third place, but lost the bronze by Mustafa in the Thai Break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which Americans call the "mother" was far ahead.
She sent a kissing crowd after her free exercise covered by a return, which sometimes seemed under question.
As for Bayles, the 19-year-old virus tweet from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: Three killed in serial killer shooting while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the deadliest attack in the case of the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade, sat in the car, spoke and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports published Thursday.
Angela Rochel Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Malia, were shot dead on June 12, when their car was parked on the passenger part, the authorities said.
The criminal made about eight shots from a gun standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he escaped on another vehicle, the report reports.
Police say the triple murder is not apparently the result of the robbery, as the offender did not take the wallets or $2,900 that were at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting encouraged investigators to check whether it was related to the four previous attacks.
Only seven people were killed and two others were injured as a result of nine attacks in two mainly Latin American areas over four months.
“This is happening in the residential area in front of the house,” said Howard KPHO, a branch of CBS, at the beginning of this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked to each other and committed by the same killer.
Alice, 33 years old, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31 years old, and daughter Ellis, Malia, died on the site.
A witness told the police that there was nothing unusual that they sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, the target of which was an empty pickup half an hour before the triple murder and which is believed to have been the hand of a serial killer.
Investigators found gills and pulled the bullet out of the seat and fragments of the bullet out of the motor section.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-old children, Edmund Pixito loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has a microcephaly as a result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixito did not know during pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was – I can’t do it.
I can’t do that.
I did not sign on it.
What, in fact, isn’t true – you’re signing on it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never know them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even proposed to place it in a specialized medical facility.
“My first answer was, ‘I didn’t think people still do that’,” Piksimoto explained.
Edmund walks with the way.
Edmund was neither sitting nor sitting until he was three, and he is still not speaking.
But it slowly passes through some stages.
He walks with foreign help and rides on a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund invented for "Please join me."
“We’re teaching him the language of gestures,” Pixito told CBS News.
But it’s not just the usual language of gestures – it says that Edmund has invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can arise as a result of a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as curl and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Piximoto reminds of emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I always said what would happen.
What will happen?
And she still doesn’t know.
I didn’t really ask for a lifetime forecast because I don’t expect someone to really tell me.
But Piximoto has an encouraging advice for mothers of children with inherited defects due to Zika.
It becomes better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rain, flooding are the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Strong rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to announce emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state until Saturday including.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and south of Mississippi have gone out of the coast and are threatened by large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and the aid has already gone out to the victims.
Mike Style, representative of the National Security and Emergency Preparation Governor's Office, said there are requests for transport for high water, boats and sand bags.
Style said that only the arrival of Tanjipahua requested tens of thousands of bags with sand.
The risk of flooding remains in force until Saturday in most parts of the south of Louisiana.
The meteorological service said in a statement that additional 3-5 inches could infiltrate the area.
In southern Alabama, the reserve in anticipation of the flood was operating until Friday, as the rain continued to go in the area of Mobila.
The Comet River next to Baton-Rouge and the Amit River next to the Day of Springs, both in Louisiana, were expected to set a record of flood levels last weekend.
Synoptic Alek Krautman said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburbs near Baton-Ruja.
He also said that the flood that goes down along the flow in the Assenchen coast is a threat as these flooding rivers will slowly flow into the Lake Morpa.
The Tico River, just south of the border of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
The rescuers were still pulling people out of the flood in Amit and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son were among the rescued early on Friday near Glostor.
Hansford, 62, says that the Bever-Krik waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rise rapidly overnight.
He said that another passenger, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up and the water continued to come,” Hansford said.
It reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the greatest flow she had seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family members had a disability, and he was the only one who knew how to swim.
Hansford said the rescue personnel saved the three with the help of an army truck and delivered them to the Gloster fire station, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautman says that the flood is "breaking rapidly" as the rain continues, noting that officials are considering the evacuation order.
Krautman says one observer near Livingstone 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautman said the soil was overwhelmed with rainfall from the environment.
The strong rain and the flooding of the streets led to work to rescue the residents from the houses in the Tanjipahua coast and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, the authorities said.
WWL, a CBS branch, reports that Tanjipahua’s adviser told about 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now flooding.
Chairman Robbie Miller said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals that were in high water.
The shelters were opened in Amit City and Hammond City to accommodate those who were evacuated.
“They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to decline,” he said.
In the town of Hammond of Tanjipahua, about two dozen streets were closed due to the high water level, and sand bags were available to residents in the hope that they will keep the water away from homes and enterprises.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said city manager Lacy Landrum.
This is on the way to become a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison District, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacy, said the coastal rain continued to go to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but no one was registered on Friday.
Kate Tousson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” Tausson said, “and it’s still flying on the ground.”
Mahaj Brown, 6 years old, "disclosed by the bullets," remains alive after a shooting in Philadelphia
Police reports that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shot in a six-year-old boy this week.
The grandmother and grandfather of the child recognized him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandmother and grandmother say Brown received numerous fire injuries, including his pach, leg, hand and stomach, but was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got a lot, his little body was scattered by the bullets,” his grandmother Delores Melandes told the station.
I just can’t believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has suffered several operations.
The family told the station that it is expected to be recovered.
He had to go to the first class in the local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old and one 32-year-old.
It is that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a shooting between several armed people.
The gills of semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, made the place of action.
It seems that it was a long battle.
There were gills on the street, on both sides of the trottoir.
Therefore, according to all, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many houses and cars in the area were also loaded.
No arrests were made, and the police, according to reports, are watching video surveillance cameras.
Another six-year-old boy, a girl, was hit in the hand of a crazy bullet on Tuesday when she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She is recovering and the police are still searching for the suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabbie and Laurie?
This is what I call the women's Olympic team of gymnastics this year and for a number of reasons.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And the second: in this team key role are played by three gymnastics: Simon Bailes, Gabbie Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many black girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Eli Rysman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
It looks like America finally.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this type of sport.
For the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It is powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabbie Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed.
Now the world could be witnessing the incredible performances of the three-time World Champions Simon Bailes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected but yet virtuous gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American woman in a row winning gold in the female individual absolute primacy.
The team colleague, Elie Rysman, earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this kind of sport, but it doesn’t look like that in the gym sections throughout the country.
Simona, Gabbie and Laurie all chose the same way as Elie and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They’re the “final five,” because the next Olympic team in gym will have only four gymnastics in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli’s training.
But in reality gymnastics is a expensive sport, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnastics clubs supported by the help of parents paying the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions for competitions, payment of hotel services (for coaches and their gymnastics and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics are located in rich suburbs that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnastics get everything from their training, and this is a expensive and long-term duty for gymnastics families.
Amy Burman, the coach of Simona Bailes, and Meggie Hani, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they took over for gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for the community of countless young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations we have already provided free and cheap gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young children (mainly black and Latin American) and educated national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics that deserves the opportunity to learn and take advantage of this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to stressful work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a positive impact throughout life on good health, school and work success.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to practice gymnastics, and that’s wonderful.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
This is a wonderful time now.
Thank you, Simon, Ellie, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the "Women's Force" in winning the team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The younger doctors took up for announcing further strikes after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer
The ministers hoped to end the dispute about the changes by agreeing the amended agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, saying that NHS was on "no land" and any subsequent delay would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first younger doctors are transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work hours at night and weekends to improve service outside class hours.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Young Doctors of the BMA, said yesterday evening in a statement: "The young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it is questioning the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
It’s only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is out.
The WMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was encountered by a refusal to take action and sometimes full silence from the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's last month's promise that his door is always open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not do so, then the younger doctors are insignificant in the fact that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike at the end of April brought about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were attracted to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picking line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute about the changes by agreeing the amended agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants a better weekend pay for 54,000 younger doctors who will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Chief Executive Officer of NHS Employers, urged younger doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: "The attacks reach little or nothing, but pressure on the already working teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, seats and their families."
Over the past two months, we have talked with the Committee of Young Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Employees hoped that the continuing positive support on other important topics – such as staff allocation, flexibility of learning, additional training for those who return after a career break, cost of learning, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic holidays and gender pay differences in medicine – were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health intended to comply with the conditions achieved by the WMA in November, February and May.
The drug for £2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use the drug for £2 a day, after the authorities recommended to give it to a greater number of people and for a longer period of time.
The antidepressant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service advised to give it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NICE Supervisory Service of the British National Health Service has advised to give it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them experience another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plate is broken into parts, then this can cause a thromb that blocks the access of blood to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thromb is moving, it will be able to move through the blood flow and block the blood flow to the brain, causing stroke.
People who have already suffered one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk, making the trombes less likely.
The NICE instructions project, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the presence of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke occurs – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
There is evidence that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and stroke in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
By pre-recommending Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - after three years is limited, the draft instructions does not recommend treatment longer than this period.
The culture of possession of the PC allows the falsification of votes in Muslim areas to prosper.
The former mayor of Tower-Hamlet, Luthfur Rahman, was dismissed last year due to corruption, serving as a push to the government’s report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the closure of the eyes, which has turned to a universal falsification of the number of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the devastating government report released today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former member of the Cabinet of Ministers, is criticized by the police, the observers of the election and the city administration for ignoring the evidence of violations in the election because of "excessive sensitivity to race and religion."
The former secretary of local communities, now anti-corruption emperor, said the intimidation of voters on a religious ground was so strong that the police should be allowed to put boundaries outside the electoral spaces to protect scared voters.
He suggests that voters take their identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, the voters have to just indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests to apply unwashed scratches on people’s fingers when they give their bulletins in order to exclude that someone can vote twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to the awareness, said Sir Eric.
He urges to give the press greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the voting scandal in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the special court, which examined election issues, ruled that current mayor Luftur Rahman was to be dismissed due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and forced his critics to silence, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, "visited his campaign based on the fact that the duty of the Muslim believers was to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes caused doubts or were the result of the character when a person votes presenting someone else.
Sir Eric said there were witnesses of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concerns about fraud by mail voting, in which senior members of the Muslim community, according to the reports, made pressure on people to vote for the candidate they selected.
Sir Eric, on the photo, made several recommendations on the cleansing of the voting system, including the requirement to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
“The evidence of the pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, to vote on the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladesh’s origin, has been presented.
“There were concerns that... state institutions closed their eyes to such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of ‘political correctness’ regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from working with mail bulletins to vote in order to stop the "collection of votes."
The report, discussed by Theresa May, also calls for rigorous registration inspections to prevent the list of voters from being used for fraud with immigration and privileges.
The option is considered to require voters to submit their identity certificate before voting.
Use unwashable fingers on people’s fingers as soon as they throw their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To conduct systematic nationality checks to make sure they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic mail voting.
To remove political campaign participants and activists from working with filled back votes and post voting conversions.
Give the police the power to set boundaries around the electoral spaces.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be accused of intimidation in accordance with the 1983 People's Act.
Illegal photographing in the electoral areas.
Require only English to be used in the elections (except in Wales).
Increase training to ensure that staff forces voters to go into the booth one by one.
Sir Eric is angry attacking the city police, saying it’s “surprising” that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower-Hamlets case.
"The court examining election issues disqualified Luther Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions," he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful “checks for the fool” of the electoral registration departments of the administrations of cities.
Sir Eric said: “The last year’s court ruling in Tower Hamlet was a sign of awakening.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the anxious and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy by the cycling analogue Kate and other twins of the Olympic celebrities in Rio
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week were foolish about the French cyclist Polyn Ferran-Prevo, who appeared to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic player is far from the only athlete struggling for gold this summer who can pride in her own famous twin – at least, according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrity that appear on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympians who have more than superficial similarity to the Hollywood stars.
The Hunter and the Wolf: A member of the male U.S. radiator team, Brady Ellison, left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's twin on a bicycle road, many people online have been quick to indicate how a certain brilliant could be the twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. rays team, Brady Ellison, was the cause of the hurricane on Twitter after the images of him appeared terribly similar to the star Wolf from Wall Street.
In fact, he learned about the madness of social networks and acknowledged he had heard that he was like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge similarity, except for vegetation on the face,” Brady Huffington Post said.
“He’s an attractive guy, so I think it’s a compliment.”
One of the most popular London 2012 comparisons will undoubtedly indicate even more this year: an amazing similarity between the British jumping Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafaina, with her big expressive eyes, they say, is the exact copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg was compared to the star of Hora Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sport version" of the actor "Nachal"
Another long-lasting comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnet, who can pride in similar heavy braces and lips.
Silver medalist Yulia Ephimov from Russia can proud not only with the same burned skin and bright hair as actress Anna Lynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, according to fans, looks like "the sports version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Hard Women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same shapes of face and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating theory: According to this user, there may be a reason that lies in the foundation of the similar appearances of this pair
One Twitter user recently addressed the site to reveal his enthusiasm that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the American football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar shapes of face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the same smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the winning gold medal gymnast Gabbie Douglas, who can rejoice with her own beautiful broad smile, which looks like the smile of the star "Give Success" Gabriel Union.
The commentator of the Olympics on CBC apologizes for saying about the Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
The analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth place in the finals of the 14-year-old Ay Yanghane on the female staff with a free style of 4x200 m annoyed the CBC viewers on Wednesday in the live broadcast of the Olympics
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of her commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a wave" and "dead like a pig" during the swimming.
The commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final 4x200m female staff in a free style.
It was possible to hear how McDonald, who was attracted to the CBC commentary team to "release her with color," said: "This 14-year-old Chinese girl has broken the ball, a boy."
She was very excited, started like a wave, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ay Yanghan, who was 14 years old, passed the second stage of the staff at 1:57,79 – 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing the Canadians to eliminate the departure from China.
Spectators across Canada reacted quickly on the net after they were shocked by the tone and expressions used.
Emmet McFarlane tweeted: "Is the CBC dictator just said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'was dead like a pig'???"
This fool didn’t realize that they were still in the radio.”
About Ay Yang Yang from China in the final of the women's 4x200 m free style said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl lost the ball, a boy."
The criticism on Twitter immediately broke down on Byron McDonald, and many called for his dismissal.
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Nothing to #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us like a bunch of racists.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who was the CBC broadcaster, apologized in the live broadcast for McDonald’s comments, saying: “We’re apologizing for the comment on the swimming performance came into the broadcast.”
It was a failed choice of words, we’re sorry that it happened.”
The U.S. Air Force concluded with apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement.
Scott Russell's commentator's friend had to apologize from McDonald's face
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The TV also urged to apologize and publish the statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
Yesterday evening we acted quickly to apologize to our live viewers and our subscribers on social networks.
We make it clear that Byron’s comments were referred to the performance of the swimmer, not to her as a personality.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very regreting what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized in direct broadcast and tried to clarify his comment, saying he didn’t think his words were interpreted as an attack on a person.
“I would like to take advantage of the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s staff,” he said on the Olympic Games broadcast on CBC.
"I talked about the performance of the swimmer, not about her personally."
“I understand that there was no dishonor, and I am very sorry.”
The primark buyer insulted a woman who shaped the underwear in the middle of the store.
Buyers didn’t know where to take a look when a woman was naked to see the pants on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she saw how she looked in them, stretched them and put them back on the plate.
She continued the search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear in the Bouverie Place shop in Falkston.
The Primark store of the Bouverie Place shopping center in Falkland, where a woman shaped triangles before placing them back on the plate.
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the store, said that after a sample of the underwear the mysterious woman again "wear up and went out of the store without buying anything."
She said, “People could not believe what they saw.”
Standing in the middle of the shopping room, she took a couple of pants from the window, took out her own pants and pants and dressed them.
“She didn’t try to find any narrow place to do it – she just stood there, unhappy.”
"Everyone got off when she dropped the pants again, and they obviously didn't like it because she put them back on the plate."
She did the same with the other three couples before she finally decided that there was nothing she would like, dressed again and went out.
“It doesn’t seem that she was careful, who was watching her, or that she thought about the man who would eventually buy the t-shirts she was shaping.”
33-year-old Jenny Davidson, from Kent, said, “It’s unfortunate to think that someone is going to take the t-shirts that someone else has already wearing, and they’ve not been dressed.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday.
Davidson added: “I make the conclusion that the staff, apparently, tried to remove these items of clothes from the sale after she left – well and better.”
"I't want to come home with a new couple of women's shirts and find that another woman dressed and took them away, and they were not wrapped."
Primark’s representative said: “Primark knows about the incident that happened in our shop in Falkston on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods mentioned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Pistol Attack using a Cowboy
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked with Ron Mizrachi, the Master of the Cowboy Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed thieves on a close distance.
Whether you get in front or behind, this video will show you how to beat the thief with his own weapon.
If you get back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing you have to do is to turn up so that you see the attacker and 'release the line of fire'.
Then you strongly press the pistol between your forearm and shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free lock.
Then the knee follows in the pach, and as long as the attacker slides from the pain, you turn the pistol out of his hands, beat it in the face with a stone and go back, hold the weapon imposed on it.
For the armed, suitable in front, the way of performing is similar - turn your body from the line of fire, quickly catch the pistol and scratch it so that the evil could not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the pistol and hit the attacker with a bullet in the chest, then turn the pistol out of his catch before going back and targeting it.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi is doing it.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery — if you’re not the master of the cowboy — is to give your cash.
For the guide, traveler Jan Wright spends his language in the dirty places of Europe.
A British traveler has suffered a serious test of his immune system and vomiting reflex, lying some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The leader and author of travel books, Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolk, spent the language on the euro banknote, the Circus Piccadilly pearls, the unitas washing button in the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before surrounding each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it is going into.
But the experiment, which was to be a film entitled “The Passenger-Lyson Guide to the Inner Power,” gave some amazing results.
The idea of sliding the washing button in a train, which is used by thousands of others, can be extremely disgusting, but in fact there are worse bacteria in the kitchen roof.
Thro his trip to Europe, Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing of the slurry brought him more than bad taste in the mouth.
Wright became famous for his intestinal strength tests, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public washes on the stations to the unitas cleaning button, this task, without a doubt, experienced his immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, 'Since childhood I was completely neglected about my health and I pulled a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He has proven his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
His test mask demonstrated the value of a luminometer exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet, which he refused to blush after the value of its luminometer was more than 4000 units, while just washed hands show less than 60 units.
Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a film about a traveler entitled "The Passenger-Lisune Guide to the Inner Power", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet.
In the film, he said, “It’s close to one of the worst things I’ve smelled in the toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty than this!
I’m not going to blame anything because it’s crazy.
“The Passenger-Lisuna Guide to the Internal Force” was taken together with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Valio Gefilus, which contains acid milk bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice-President Valio on snacks, juices and new categories said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brain attack that ended with the idea of “to call Jan”.
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is related to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we were able to present consumers more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakal, who was the film’s director, added: “Let’s say that I’d lose respect for Jan if he had surrounded some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.”
Of course, some of Yan’s things were easier to get around, and some were quite hard.
I’m glad that some of these slides we’ve been able to capture on the film.”
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked acid milk bacteria exclusively with good stomach and intestinal condition, and 58 percent said they ate, at least sometimes, foods containing added acid milk bacteria.
Humilians family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall municipality, on the day of displacement
The households left their municipal house with a loss of £50,000 after they were displaced for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanu Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilko have been expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly displaced from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found this property in a state that requires repairs.
The walls were left with floating holes, the halves were opened, the waste was dispersed on the floor and the walls were packed with graffiti.
The family is now displaced and is believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a resident at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he would not be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh because this property is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys evil glory, and their name enjoys evil glory.
The couple has three sons who lived in the property from time to time, and the police reports that the kingdom of horror caused by the family included struggles on the street with baseball bits, intimidation of residents of the nearby districts, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and scams.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house that could be removed, old waste was found.
The sex sheets in the house where drugs were sold in the past were removed.
Neighbors say they saw struggles on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner to leave the house this week after they were granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The displacement was welcomed by the neighbors who said their lives had turned into the essence of hell.
One said, “They didn’t worry anyone.”
We have lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here was incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here – we didn’t get used to it!
Now that they finally leave, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Security Group, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police and regularly called the police.
The waste and old toys were dispersed below the grown side of the municipal house.
He added: 'It's a shame that the tenant was unable to take any responsibility for her and her family's behavior, as displacement is always the last method of action that is considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was limited, and their actions should have been terrible for its observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, police and members of the community of Devon and Cornwall have done, who have courageously acted to give us information.
I hope this development will give a little comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that associate behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they all had a little more than 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms after displaced
Displacement workers will now have to remove the breasts of the waste that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police conducted a search in the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as the weights, the corresponding accessories and £1700 cash.
Skeldon was punished after acknowledging himself guilty of possession of class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money went to pay the tomb for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After making them homeless, there is information that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were packed with graphites throughout the surface.
Police say they will try to displace rentalers who are not subject to the rental rules.
Angela Crowe, from the Devon and Cornwall police, said that the displacement sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the accusations of the prosecutor, as well as those who are damaged by such behavior," she said.
Criminal and anti-social behavior will never be allowed by the police of Devon and Cornwall, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal came in horror when a low-layer military plane hardly touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love to sleep on the sun were terribly scared for their lives.
P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force fled incredibly low
The air force said he was doing a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This is the moment when scared tourists begin to panic, while the moment when a low-cover airplane spiked over the overfilled beach.
The dramatic images show a military plane flying almost at a touch distance from hunters on a sand strip to Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The breathers jumped on their feet as soon as they became worried about the noise of the aircraft’s engines for clear reasons, but had no opportunity to see what was moving toward them through the cloud.
The incident occurred yesterday night near the city of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the few travellers who posted a video of the shocking spring on social networks, said: "He flown quite low twice, and there was a moment that at some point it seemed to break down."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear that there was a feeling that the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were terribly scared when the plane appeared from the cloud and flown at an extremely low height.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the P-3C Orion pilot carried out a training flight to detect fishing vessels near the coast and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane fled slightly lower than usual due to the insufficient visibility caused by smoke from the nearby hot forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged the continental part of Portugal, and also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances - a thick hole and a hole from forest fires that worsened visibility.
The aircraft carried out a training flight, and the pilot was commissioned to detect fishing boats within the task.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for food for more than a year, but most cafés and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by food manufacturers and carriers, as well as companies in the field of food in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
The business inspections by Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far officials issue fines only for individual violations of the regulation (see "List of documents...").
Failure to comply with the regulation will cost the enterprise 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
The HASP as a system that takes into account and prevents food risks, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
The system is now used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015 the HASSP has been operating on the territory of the TS.
The development and implementation of the system in the business was 4 years (HASP demand appeared in the TS regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials acknowledge that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
We, unfortunately, have long been sure that the rule applies only to food producers, not to restaurants, the head of the Public Council, Elena Cereteli, explained.
Everyone is trying to get back to the lost.
The expected deadline for the renewal of charter flights to Turkey - late August - beginning September.
But they will not trigger an agitating demand, as their target audience - families with children - are already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of tourist agencies sent a letter to the government with a request to allow charters already now.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of choosing quality and affordable marine recreation is unresolved, since in the resorts of the Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea most accommodation facilities are already booked until the end of September," the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter transports in August will not significantly affect the already formed demand for the Russian marine tour product.
As in the Northwestern Regional Department of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry (RST), in case the aviation agencies of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the renewal of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when charters will be renewed, until there is no, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the necessary on the direction of the ships,” says Pavel Rumyancev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the Northwestern Regional Department of the RST.
According to him, the possible renewal of the charters is a good news, but it won’t too much affect the strengths of the market, because the main buyers of charter tours – families with children – have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or taking holidays in other countries.
During the barhat season, the tours are purchased mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumyancev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budgetary offers - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who intentionally expect very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it’s not worth counting on the aggregation – the main mass of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyancev also believes that, as there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be demanded, but the agitation is not worth waiting.
“For Turkey, the launch of the charters now is a repetition of the next season,” says Pavel Rumyancev.
“Opening the charters to Turkey is a positive news for the next season,” Valeria Rubtsova said.
The tax code provides for the exemption from the NDFL established by the legislation of compensation payments within the limits of approved norms related to the compensation of damage caused by injury or other health damage.
The issuance of milk to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions according to the established norms is provided for in Article 222 of the Russian Civil Code.
The same norms and conditions of issuance are established by the Order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free delivery of milk or other equivalent food products is made to workers in the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful productive factors on the workplace.
Based on the aforementioned norms, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation concluded in the addressed letter that on the basis of paragraph 2 p. 3 of Article 217 of the National Code of the Russian Federation are exempt from the taxation of income in the form of the value of milk, issued to workers on days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Norms and conditions approved by the Order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
The Moscow Gazstroy Bank remained without the license of the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew the license to carry out banking transactions with the credit organization Stock Commercial Bank "GAZSTROYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, ACB "GASTROYBANK" carried out a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken on the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank’s assets have led to the establishment of the basis for the implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in conducting doubtful transit transactions.
In the bank, the temporary administration is appointed by the time of validity until the time of appointment to the competition manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
ACB "GASTROYBANK" is a member of the deposit insurance system.
The payment of insurance compensation to depositary of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with the Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the remainder of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles.
Payments, according to the Insurance Agency, will start not later than August 26, 2016.
According to the data of the report, by the size of the assets of the ACB "GAZSTROYBANK" on 1 August 2016 occupied 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS died in Syria
Kadyza Sultan, one of the three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join ISIS, is to have died in Syria.
Advocate Tassim Akunji said her family learned about her death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Rakka, a group in the country, according to ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-developed country and return to England.
“It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this – like the tomb and the testament to others, that it’s exactly the risks we’re talking about when traveling to the zone of war – will forge people to ever make the same choice,” Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolchildren from east London moved on a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said she was married to a terrorist in Syria and became a widow for a few months.
Reed says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a Supreme Judge candidate if elected
Democratic Senate leader Harry Reed says he is convinced that the Democratic president candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected as president.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's statement as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person who will be able to replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicts that Clinton will choose Garland "with some degree of confidence."
Reed later said he didn’t talk to Clinton directly about whether she would push Garland, and she just built assumptions.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "shake the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States District Court of Appeal.
Reed said the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are "acceptable" and "supporters" of the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not suitable for the position.
Treats says that erotic calendars for 'women as well as for men'
The magazine Treats works with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by the Pirelli of the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they are aiming to find the next generation of top models for their calendar for 2017 with naked muses.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from the old-fashion Playboy because "Playboy - for men".
I do it for women.
Of course, he thinks that the calendar too.
“We need to return to the demonstration of an eternal and classic naked figure, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or personally on open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
The Muslims will share memoirs of unfair online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to launch a monument that will tell you how not to become the victim of an online store.
This was in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is that the experts of the department are preparing a monument that will help citizens correctly choose the online store and recognize possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides several sections.
This will be the general information and the legislative basis, the rules of delivery of goods, the ways to protect their legal rights.
In the application will be given recommendations on how to correctly make the claim and so on," - said in Rospotrebnadzor.
Remembrance to the present moment is being processed.
It will later be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute to the Mosquitians.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has published a statement in which it named the name of the second suspect in the organization of divergence in the Crimea.
People from the Ukrainian and Russian citizens who assisted in the preparation of terrorist attacks have been arrested.
Among them are Mr. Yevgeny Aleksandrovich and Zachtey Andrei Romanovich.
“All of them give grateful testimonies,” the statement said.

The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation in the amount of 438 million rubles.
The penalty for Google for the violation of the anti-monopoly legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay a fine in the near future,” said Deputy Chairman of the FAS Alexey Docenko.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies to the manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in the territory of Russia, the Google Play app store only provided that other corporate apps will be installed on the device.
Among these applications is the search system, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Article 1 of Article 10 of the FZ "On the Protection of Competition" (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide the opportunity to develop competition on the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a beneficial impact on our consumers.
The law "On the protection of competition" must be respected to all companies whose products are delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations including," said the head of the Office of Regulation of Communications and Information Technologies of the FAS of Russia, Elena Zaeva.

Earlier it was that the relatives of Ernst the Unknown are planning to hold a sculptor panoramic event in New York, supposedly until August 14.
The final consumer of vinyl: who actually purchases plates?
Solitary men of middle age love vinyl.
And until you have stopped shrinking the comment section with brutal insults under the pseudonym NeEveryoneMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMale
According to YouGov, so much of the discussed rebirth of plates is due not to the boom among the generation of two thousand who want to penetrate the new material object, but to the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who recently bought the vinyl album c are likely to be aged 45 to 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those belonging to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
This is also not just an act of gathering amateurs – it has emotional importance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings in themselves (56 percent against 53 percent) and enjoy loneliness (69 percent against 66 percent).
But are YouGov results true?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would follow me while I would walk through the center of the vibrant Soho Street, in a modest gray costume and bustly gestualizing before stopping, laying up the hands and saying something impressive like: "Yes, let's look."
So let’s look.
While Soho’s heart is slowly deprived of its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores have now captured the buildings once occupied by independent sellers – a few music stores with fantastic specialists are still left.
I’d probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I’m close to different people in some of these stores and try to evaluate their age and emotional mood through observation.
The son of Glasgow Stuart, 55 years old, after which I went from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men of the middle age) to Reckless Records (data count: eight men of the middle age, one woman probably over the age of 20), in London for a half-day to hold a meeting, and walks through stores to take a few hours.
He is a collector, I ask.
“I think yes,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These discs shown above (he sent me a photo by email, I didn’t trace him to the house), go through the lines on the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partially derived from his available income: he can now buy plates that he could not afford when they just came out, and buy out the items he sold when he was young and on the mole.
“Many of what I acquire is the end of the 60s, the beginning of the 70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things for which I was probably too young to buy,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding: “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink too much.
This is my deficiency.
Wes, a 25-year-old who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets match the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people who were under the influence of the noise in the media, people who heard about the return and felt obliged to buy their old plates.
Judging by the conversations I had, people get rid of their collection, usually about in 1998 or 1999.
“Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy compact disks are now selling their compact disks to buy their disks,” he says.
This can explain the boom among the reloaders of the vinyl of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the discs?
It’s enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that the plate shops offer a comfortable society for people with similar views.
According to Weza, some older customers, in particular, are insulted by the cash-free payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to get away from the consistency of familiar dishes, objects that wake up memories of the impeccable youth.
"I think that sometimes it can be filling the emptiness or possessing material things as a kind of calming," says Wes.
Since I am a collector, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
This is a simple way to take your head.
“We are like their social workers!” said a colleague from the plateau.
A ICM survey in April showed that 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a player.
At this stage of the news reporting, I would probably look seriously confused, a blurry stallage with the collections of Bosanov.
The "Trophy" aspect of resurrection is what Johnny, 42 years old, who works in Sounds of the Universe, noticed.
“Somebody came recently and said, ‘I don’t have a playoff player, but I want to buy a Radiohead playoff so we can put it up with a plate,’ he says.
This is not a big percentage, but this is the case.
More composition, less music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a playoff player.”
These are younger people, not elderly, they have a little less than twenty who are only familiar with it.
Fopp, who now has taken almost the whole floor of the vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples who are over 70, tourists who photograph, teen boys and women of the middle age.
Although the atmosphere is less unnecessary than in the above-mentioned stores – the latest synt and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, breaks through columns – it’s pleasant to see diversity in its customers.
No one of them looks lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish staying next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleonora, 27 years old, walked through Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various discs available for sale.
They look at the goods, not spending money.
She doesn’t make a lot, according to her, so collecting plates is not a very suitable option.
It is expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of the vinyl is ...", she is immersed in dreams with a breath filled with love.
I don’t know how to explain, it’s really unique.
My last stop is a store that, as they say, contributed to the appearance of a new generation of vinyl lovers: City fashionists.
As I create the illusion that I’m looking at jeans shorts, I’m watching a group of teen girls gathering around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter begin to discuss the purchase of the Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is placed by the plates of Adel, Jeff Bakley, Amy Winehouse and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory plates for any medium collection.
No one looks — because they are just a decoration, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is a true “art vinyl.”
But given that any attracting attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers to the depths of Sochi for a while, there is almost nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that the layer of the population that has more probability than the majority has more time and money than the majority is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my conclusions indicate that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in the Soho plates shops, they do not exclude the existence of a huge number of women-collectors and vinyl amateurs that exist in reality, in the plates shops and on the online forums.
These people are probably all working in schools or offices.
But they obviously don’t spend Thursday’s morning walking through the brick shops on the Berwick Street, bricking brickings and avoiding the sights of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake leader who hangs over the shoulders of no suspicious men of the middle age.
Greenland polar sharp - the longest vertebral animal - video report
Scientists say that the Grenland polar sharp has the longest life of all the spine on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says that the record was set by a female age of 272 to 512 years and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to shut down shops in the jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the proposal of the Kale authorities to remove dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearing this week, the Kale authorities said that the state should be able to remove a total of 72 self-made stores, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to shave or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or the simplest dishes for a few euros in self-made restaurants.
The prefecture of Kale said that these places should be removed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, claiming that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number in the camp.
They said that self-made stores and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those who need it.
The court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel the people who run 72 own shops, but stated that the problems of the prefecture of Kale were “fullly understood.”
Judge Jean-François Mollah said the bars, cafés and restaurants played a much greater role than simply feeding people who “live in extreme shadows.”
He said the spaces provided peaceful points of meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened was the Children's Book Jungle Cafe at the camp, which works for no benefit and offers 200 lunch per day, English and French lessons and asylum consultations for hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanying in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children’s cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said that his closure "will be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years."
Two charity institutions, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the population in the jungle camp grew and exceeded 9,000 people - the highest in history - after a sharp increase in newcomers during the summer.
The libraries of the microregions invite young freelancers to the knowledge programs.
This week, the libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physicist.
The programs are aimed at the children’s audience, so most of them will be played in a game form.
Today, August 10, the library-filial No. 2, in the Zlinean micro-region, invites to the cruise-presentation "My City is small".
On the 11th of August in the Library-Filial No. 1 will take place the landscape hour "I live in this city, I know this city."
In the Library-Filial No. 2 on the same day will be a multimedia lesson "The Land of the Mother's Past Destiny".
And in the Library-Filial No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, Film, Film".
On Sunday, 14 August, for children from the northern micro-region, the library-filial No. 3 will hold the game program "Fizkult-Hello!".
Britain stops on silver in Regbi-7, after the Fiji master class allows them to take gold.
The impressive UK series in Regbi-7 was devastatingly stopped at the final obstacle by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday evening when they were completely defeated 43-7 at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave the master's class in possessing the ball, scratching, deprivation, supporting the game, running the lines and the brutal force to win the gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor comfort in the form of silver — the third in Britain in a day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Rugby 7 Olympic tournament in which on the way they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The painful battle of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier on the same day, could return to negatively affect them in the final.
But, regardless of anything, Fiji in this form won a team of 15 people as best as possible.
It may be some comfort for the UK — but it’s probably not — that at least one British will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s chief coach Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one.
These attacks will cause pain, but the progress is stunning.
Fiji started great, for fun rejecting the United Kingdom's attempts to catch the ball.
It was like knocking on a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisaou drowned in the corner.
Having four minutes on the hours, Jerry Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and Britain hardly touched the ball.
The great attempt to capture Mitchell kept the mountain man Leon Nakarav from killing the third, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremallua made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after the renewal and the hours were still more than a minute ... in the first half.
Vathemo Ravovo then broke through a few more flawed attempts to overthrow the UK and by the attack took the line to get a point.
The realization led to 29-0 in the break.
It seemed as if Fiji was born to play in the Regby-7, while Britain still mastered the craft.
That is largely so.
The UK made mass replacement in the half of the game, and they seized the Fiji Damba ... for all four minutes, which was good according to the standards of the first half until Joshua Twaisov passed after a few brilliant Fiji interactions.
Dan Norton captured an attempt for the UK by making a touchdown in the left corner to make the account 36-7, but the game has long gone on the way of the South Sea Islands, whose fans sing, flags and danced on the tribunes.
It was impossible not to admire the pleasant approach of Fiji.
Matthew William decorated the Fiji cake, which did not need to be decorated, another attempt in the last seconds.
It sounded a whistle, the Fijians took up, and Britain fell into the garden, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day, the Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-finals, and the UK had a little over South Africa in the anxious semi-finals of one attempt for each — the difference British realization.
Kyle Brown leads Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton with some great work of his legs broke the line and hit under the balls in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to capture from Marcus Watson, his 15-year-old brother toward England team, Anthony, guaranteed victory – and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glower and Heather Staning are inspired to win the grabble fighting coach with cancer
There will be no more exciting gold on these games, and that is about something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glower and Heather Staning found an additional value for their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the wheels, in this boat there were three votes, Robin Williams' echo coach was always as long as they sought for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in the British sports anal that reached such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unbeatable performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes sliding on the surface with the elegance of the leaves do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind each gold grabbed a batalion of ready-made hands, contributing to gradually growing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn’t know if he would live before seeing that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had a bladder cancer, which is one of what they can operate, and they did it.
If they do not, they go everywhere.
This could be a pretty bad situation.
It changes your vision for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment in the beginning of 2014 in the intersection, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it could be the right expression in such circumstances as these.
I needed to pay, so I needed to fix quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked by the department — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet a time, although they said it was enough for a few steps.
This is how it begins.
Grabbing in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, trying to overcome his own experiences.
Staning, the captain of the artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said: "I was an emotional break this week, maybe it's a little crazy, but it means so much."
This only confirms how much it means for me, how much I and Helen worked, and Robin too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be no one, so great thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I could not ask for a best coach or a best coach.
Helen Glower and Heather Staning did not lose any race in five years.
This pair sets a tensioned rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Staning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very in phase.
Helen spoke, ‘Be in the process, stay in the process.’
It is very important not to be enthusiastic now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do something amazing.
We didn’t wait for the fireworks today, we just waited that we could go out and win this race as we did.
The couple will take a year to decide their future.
Glowers must be on a wedding next month, on her own with TV adventure searcher Steve Bacchall.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
This would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
It was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so better,” she said.
The government extends the deadline for the destruction of sanctions products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of foods prohibited for imports to Russia.
The corresponding decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it was published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russia sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The prohibition has been extended several times, now it is in force until December 31, 2017.
It is prohibited to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The elimination of food imported to the country under the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only in the first quarter of 2016 about 100 tons of prohibited products were drawn out of sale.
The hunting of the “prohibit”
There are rain and storms in Moscow on Friday.
A atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, which will bring rainfall and lower the temperature of the air.
During the day the air is heated to 25 degrees of heat.
So, on Saturday night in Moscow places will be short-term rain, possible storms and wind breaks up to 15 m/s.
During the day, rain is expected with storms and wind breaks up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with storms are also predicted in the Orlovsk, Kursk and Voronezh regions, reports "Dni.ru".
The next week the rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO arbitration panel has established that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the organization’s rules.
Import rates exceed the obligations taken by Russia when it joined the WTO.
“This is the first time the WTO has made a decision against the Russian Federation,” the organization said in a statement on its official website.
However, the arbitrators emphasized in their conclusion that the European Union did not present sufficient evidence that the measures of Russia were "systematic" or "comprehensive".
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization on the actions of Russia, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the behavior of the U.S. in resolving disputed issues in the WTO undermines the principles adopted in the organization of discussion.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members have made a similar statement because the Americans refused to approve South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa for the second term.
In this context, Russia will not address the WTO on the question of the Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
WTO is an international organization founded in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It currently includes 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The chairman changed in the administration.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed former deputy Sergey Ivanov Anton Weino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin carried out reforms in the administration of the president and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weino said during the meeting that he considers an important anti-corruption work, which he began to carry out as head of the administration of President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Previously, “Izvestia” wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the resignation nothing will fundamentally change in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who worked in the administration of the president for a long period of time, left and effectively built the activities of the AP.
In his place came the deputy head of the administration Anton Weino, a person who knows the specificity of this work.
In Poland, they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish state oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that over a few years gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive for it due to reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was by the Vice President of the Polish Finance Company Boguslav Mažec.
His words are transmitted by TASS.
“It may happen that we’re not going to buy gas at all (with Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply directions for us will be the East, the raw materials from the LNG terminals and Norway,” Mažec said.
At present, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than the 2015 level.
The Russian gas giant’s share in PGNIG purchases grew to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
On July 22, the Polish anti-monopoly department failed to agree on the creation of the joint venture Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
This month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for 11 billion cubic meters of gas through the Nord Stream-2.
This was stated by Deputy Chairman of the Holding Alexander Medvedev.
The North Stream 2 power auction will take place in 2017, and the autumn of 2016 is planned to take a auction on its stock.
At the end of May, it was that Gazprom has not yet planned to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to renounce long-term contracts for gas supplies from Russia after 2022, said Deputy Chairman of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year the Poles only increased by 42% the purchases of gas from the Russian Federation.
Gazprom added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG filed a statement to the Stockholm Arbitration Court still does not mean the termination of negotiations.
Previously, the Polish company appealed to the court to a drop in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Peter Naimsky, authorized by the Polish government on gas and energy infrastructure, said that the Polish authorities have decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for gas supplies.
The Polish contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Polish government authority for gas and energy infrastructure Petro Naimsky said that his country could refuse to supply blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new supply terminal of liquid natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
"North Stream-2" provides for the construction of two nits of a marine gas pipeline of a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with the Crimea.
This was by the first deputy chairman of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, answering the corresponding question of journalists.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, incidents that affect security, there are not recorded.
The observers were monitoring what was happening on three transit points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
In the network appeared a video of landing at the Ufa airport of the passenger aircraft Jak-42, which went out of the boundaries of the rally and landing band at 400 meters and fell on the left wing.
The video was released by the TV channel 360.
The meeting took place at 4:30 Moscow time.
The airline “Krasavia” flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no casualties.
The aircraft was transported to the parking lot.
The UFO airport operates in normal mode.
The Swedish investigative department on the transportation of the SCR was engaged in finding the cause of the hard landing of the aircraft of the aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The United Nations Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the rebel-backed areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All sides of the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but UN special ambassador to Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers the fact of the incident unquestionable.
Such statements sounded in the eve of the third round of the inter-Syria talks, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation on reports of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the terrorist attack using toxic gas, allegedly chlorine, appeared on August 2.
The opposition said that in the area where a Russian military-transport helicopter was shot down yesterday, the air force dropped bombs with poisoning, but in Moscow these accusations were called a landing.
Later, the Ministry of Defense of Russia accused the opposition group "Harakyat Nur ad-Din al-Zinki".
Soon it became known that there were two bombs started with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later I felt the smell of gas, the eyes began to burn, it became difficult to breathe," he said.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poisoning gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
UN Special Ambassador to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters, “The evidence that this really happened is a lot.”
The non-acceptable use of chlorine for military purposes is stipulated in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (COPD).
Despite the fact that all sides of the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition.”
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that the attacks in its districts are carried out daily, and the terrorists are preventing the deportation of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations is expecting Russia to set a “humanitarian break” in military actions.
The current regime of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered “unsuitable to help 2 million civilians in the hostage.”
Staffan de Mistura’s humanitarian counselor, Jan Egelan, said that a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed for the city to deliver help and evacuate the sick and wounded people every week.
“We have to send volumes of cargo from a column of trucks to a place where roads are practically destroyed and the remaining ones are mined,” Mr. Egelan said, “but the Russian delegation has confirmed its willingness to sit with us at the negotiation table.”
The consultations in Geneva between U.S. and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian break” are ongoing.
Russia has opened humanitarian windows in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest city in Syria, Russia on August 11 announced the introduction of a three-hour cessation regime, which will act daily from Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is intended to provide conditions for the delivery of medicine, food and first-need items to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was adopted on the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to withdraw the military operation and contribute to the renewal of the negotiation process.
A series of explosions in Thai resorts killed four people.
Several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people died, 19 were wounded.
The epicenter of the explosions came to the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, and no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups have taken responsibility for the incident yet, but the country’s internal ministry has rushed to say that Islamists are not involved in the incident.
Some people are suspected of organizing the explosions.
According to local police preliminary data, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the country-leading military.
Attacks occurred on popular tourist resorts, including the Patong Beach in Phuket area and the cities of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
After the arrival of the military junta to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, the country has already visited 14 million people, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been arrested, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
It’s too early to talk about the targets, he added, but the country’s foreign ministry is “confident that they are not linked to international extremist groups.”
“It’s too early to make conclusions,” Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local divergences, and we are trying to identify the personalities of those who stood behind them.
The explosion took place on the birthday of Queen Secret of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy as one of its main priorities, so the incident is most likely to be directed against it.
According to the statement of police general Sithicya Shrisopacharoenrat, the bombs were exploded remotely with a half-hour difference.
They were hidden inside trees on the lively streets filled with lunch in restaurants by tourists.
One of the four killed was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The identity of the victims is unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Police of Thailand, among them four citizens of Germany, three subjects of the Netherlands, two citizens of Italy and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service Rosturism.
Local experts also link the explosions to the August 7 referendum, on which 61.4% of the country’s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitutional commission appointed by the military junta.
The voters had to determine whether they support a system in which the Supreme House of Parliament is fully appointed by the military and has a significant role in the election of the country’s Prime Minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country's army commander Prayut Chang-Och.
To this step, he said, the army was pushed by the continuing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military established the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced the Command Hour and Censorship, dismantled the protesters and the Supreme Chamber of Parliament.
Bangkok is in emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat, in January 2014 announced an emergency state in Bangkok and neighboring provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Two explosions occurred in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred at the Victory Monument in the centre of Bangkok, where one of the main protests took place, in which 28 people were injured, five of them in critical condition.
Explosions occurred by unknown people on motorcycles.
The authorities have strengthened security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect the protesters.
The development of the conditions began in the Dry Lodge.
As it became known "Ъ", the government has been proposed to agree on the draft terms of the gold mining field of the Dry Log with the preservation of two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed not to be allowed by companies where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those candidates whose capital will not be at least 25% of the state share.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking for a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature submitted to the government the draft order and conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold mining field in Russia, the Dry Log (Irkutsk region, stocks and resources - 130 million unces), said two sources "Ъ", familiar with the situation.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project was submitted to the government.
A representative of the smoking low-purpose vice prime minister Alexander Chloponin said "Ъ", that the official's apparatus the project has not yet entered.
“The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the government’s order came out, and taking into account the deadline for the collection of applications of potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender can take place in October,” the Ministry of Nature said.
According to the "Ъ", the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, prescribed in the option, which was sent to the ministries and the FOA in July (it is at "Ъ").
The first is the presence in the capital of the candidates of at least 25% of the state part.
The second is the refusal to access the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about foreign investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles mentioned in the project, the FZ, as already wrote "Ъ" on 2 August, may not be allowed to the auction of companies whose beneficiaries (25% and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have double citizenship.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log applies to the node of federal value (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on the details before the government's order.
The demand for state share in the capital of the auction participants was issued by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "Ъ" to the Ministry of Nature and confirmed later the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergey Eroschenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with "Rostech".
Who lobbyed the restriction on admission of foreigners, the interlocutors "Ъ" do not clarify.
"But this is in the spirit of time: not to give control on the largest gold field in Russia on the background of Western sanctions," the speaker "Ъ", familiar with the preparation of the auction, says.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, said on 1 August that foreigners "will be able to go to a consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
Interlocutors "Ъ" consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main candidate for the Dry Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold producer of the Russian Federation PAO "Polyus", the controlled son of Suleyman Kerimov Said, and "Rosteh".
As "Ъ" wrote, in July partners created SP "SL Gold", where the "Poly" has 51% shares, the structure of "Rostech" RT-GR - 49%.
In the "Rostehe" refused to comment, in the "Polyse" said "Ъ" that "surely, they are interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the conditions have been announced,” he added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision for the government of the Russian Federation, sources "Ъ" said.
The possibility of participation in the development of the Dry Log was stated by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which develops assets on Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "Ъ", are not interested in the assets.
The head of the Union of gold industries of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated "Ъ" investment in the Dry Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential candidates are scared not only by the amount of investments, but also by the complexity of the project: a serious advance of stocks and the technology of complex mines are needed, the industry’s “Ъ” interlocutors explain.
On the pension market started the largest deal M&A - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of uniting four under-controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gazfond Pension Acquisitions" will be created a NPF with a volume of accumulations of about 373 billion rubles.
About the launch of the procedure of unification of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofond", "Heritage" and "Gazfond Pension Acquisitions" - yesterday announced the owner of 100% funds LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
“Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank in compliance with the requirements of non-aggravation of the conditions of existing contracts,” the company said in a statement.
The unification is carried out on the basis of "Gazfond Pension Acquisitions".
As noted by the Director-General of this NPF Oleg Bialoshitsky, the association of funds allows to solve several tasks: expansion of the geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, reduction of costs, tirage of best practices of each of the funds and optimization of corporate management.
According to him, the indicative deadline for the completion of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the unification of the NPF "Gazfond Pensions" will become the largest player on the OPS market.
According to data on March 31, the amount of pension accumulations of the united funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the report on the site of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the group itself launched much later than the competitors.
So, the control group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed the "Stalfond" earlier this year.
Currently, this unified NPF joins the Urasib and the Russian Standard funds.
"Uniting into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural tasks," said Nikolai Sidorov, the Director-General of the NPF "Future".
Active work on the consolidation of funds from April is going and in the pension group "Safmar" - the NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regional Fund" should join the NPF "Safmar" until the end of the current year.
In 2017 they will be joined by the NPF Trust.
"The unification of the funds will give the effect of strengthening the control of risks, operational processes and expenses," Saffmar said in a statement.
The break in the unification of funds, which "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" has suffered, can be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, the NPF could not buy more than 40% of the volume of the output of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively placed.
After the amendments to the decision of the Central Bank in March of this year on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, such restrictions no longer exist.
If necessary, the entire release can be purchased by one major player," says Yuri Nogin, director of the rating group of the ACRA financial institutions.
Several NPF leaders from the top-15 on assets another possible reason for the break call the division of influence spheres and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which had to be agreed by the group owners.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comments.
The request "Ъ" to the NPF "Gazfond" was also not answered.
Although the consolidation of funds is a hard-working and untouched event, on a long distance this decision will be justified.
As the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov notes, "Gazfond Pension Accumulations" has less flow, the accession will allow to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, a more successful experience of KIT Finance and Promagrofund will be required in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software.
The demand of the central bank to the processes and staff of the NPF is constantly growing, so duplicating the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy is unlikely, says Executive Director for corporate ratings "Expert RA" Pavel Mitrofanov.
“The effect of the reduction of the duplicating functions will uncertainly cross possible unification costs,” Mr. Mitrofanov notes.
The costs for the unification of the four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates in 30-50 million rubles.
“The expenditure for the maintenance of four funds of such sizes is about 400 million rubles per year, with the consolidation in the medium-term perspective the budget will actually cut twice,” Mr. Okolesnov said.
The best Disney movie "Pit and his dragon" was released in Russia.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the charming dragon, the charming story and the cantry-style songs are enough to believe in the old-fashion magic again, says Elena Krautzun.
The scared boy was picked up by the dragon, which became a human child and a gentle grandmother, and a faithful friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of a dog from a book of stories, playing with him in a hunt and sleeping in a hunt.
Six years later, he, who grew up and in a binding bond, is no longer distinguished from another thoughtful forest shrimp, Maugli.
In this form, Pita and discovers the red-haired woman-egger Grace (Bras Dallas Howard), while the Brigade of Gavina (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively walks the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help to save him.
Pete passes an accelerated course of “being a man” surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear shorts, a moral code in the heart and smile more blindly than in any advertisement.
No character looks and does not act so terribly that the spectator really begins to hate him or fear him.
Even Gavin, who opened the hunt for the untypical inhabitant of the forests under his authority, is far from the unresolved evil.
The enormous smoke dragon was also not terrible, with a good bulldog mord, the airline wing size and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon pleasantly cries, cries, even cries and, fortunately, doesn’t speak, but it always wants to smooth, with this it beneficially differs from all the well-known film dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his way of holding provides such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most stressful moments, not only the small viewers, but also the adults, begin to cry desperately into the three hands.
Surprisingly good and young Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, breaking between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuously gives out a canonic grandfather, which would be pleased to have literally every child.
How did the director David Laurie capture the fantasticly cute remake of the forgotten Disney film "Dragon Pete" of 1977, medium from the nose to the end of the tail and remembered only by a mixture of animation and game film, and make it the most emotional film of this summer?
The miracle helped.
In his painting, Laurie from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan of Pete and the dragon.
Behind the boat remained musical numbers and a lot of strange jokes.
This good story reads the traits borrowed from "Bamby", "The Alien" and many other heart-like children's paintings.
The Disney Studio continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality 21st century remedies.
Of course, "Pit and the Dragon" is not as beautiful as the same "The Book of the Jungle", and there is no tempted evil like Kate Blanchett in the role of the machoes in the new "Zolushka".
But this naive film not less successfully helps to believe in wonders and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys from the magical castle of Disney will be directed by Laurie again - for the artistic film adaptation of the story of "Peter Pane".
Tandem David Laurie and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks entered a new ambitious project about a non-adult boy based on the same-name tale of James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged
The lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing activities of the extremist structure, said the prosecutor's office found faults in the case of their defendant.
The fact that the prosecutor's office brought such an opinion, we learned from the investigators literally yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a trial on the issue of limiting the knowledge of the materials of the criminal case, but the trial was not held, and the investigators informed us of the prosecutor's presentation," - said RBC's lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor's office indicated the investigators on the incompatibility of the qualification of the case and the collected materials.
Now the investigators will have to remove the gap in the evidence base and submit to Alexander Sokolov a new accusation.
Or another article of the Criminal Code will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
As by "Ъ", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was that the investigation excluded from the accusation to the RBC journalist the formulations about "disrupting the political situation toward instability" and "setting power illegally."
The correspondent "Kommersantboscosport" Alexander Zilbert lived the life of the Olympic in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, lunched in the local dining room and even delivered the test to the WADA after that.
It seems that life doesn’t stop for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, the settlement and displacement of the village are without a stop, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m. the heads of all the Olympic delegations will be pulled into one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house, in which our, consider, sample - it was delivered into operation one of the first and demonstrated to all the checkers, even in it there are some faults.
The problem with hot water, so, forgive me, with unitases.
We have struggled for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one was going to clean up.
Then the cleansers began to come, but they only put some substance on the floor, and everything.
The fields have, you see, some innovative.
They cannot be washed humanly.
Let us know these fields - the laminate is ordinary!
Overall, the change of the clinical company has been achieved and now it’s all OK.
The Olympic village is such a Southern Boulevard, a bed area, surrounded by mountains on the one side, on the other - an impressive river, places filled with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron slope throughout the perimeter, along which the automates are walking.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings is hanging a huge Russian flag - this house is fully dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems are apparently the most urgent for the domestic team.
On the registration stands two ads: the printed "Please don't throw the paper into the toilet!" and from the hand "I will receive the gift of the mark.
The stand itself drops in the bullets.
Their pleasant flowers contrast with the titles of the brochures: "Memory of Infectious Diseases for Travellers to Rio de Janeiro", "First Aid in Drying, Income of a Stranger Body into the Respiratory Paths, Loss of Consciousness - Stages of Heart and Lung Rehabilitation", "First Aid in Burns, Heat Attack, Breakthrough and Blooding".
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, the following: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent healing.
However, a favorable outcome does not expect everyone.
Of course, in the location of the Russian team there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide the residents of the house with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
On the other hand, the medical center is the headquarters of our delegation.
Near the door is an inspiring poster "While anything, we will win!".
And of course the poems:
All the arguments are absolute bread!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let us be less, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not withdraw, it will not break down!
And for further lifting the spirit, the announcement hangs: "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and the whole of Russia Cyril the spiritual care of the athletes of the Olympic team of Russia is carried out by the prototype Andrey Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order a prayer and other tricks by phone.
In general, there is a center of meditations and religious rituals for the representatives of all confessions.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own cloth.
Due to the load of the elevator from the ninth to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the staircase that is recommended to use during the fire.
And in the darkness he met the bodies on her.
They seem to be the sleeping employees of the new clinical company.
I think, ready at any time to go on the washing of innovative seeds they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold stairs.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with my long-standing acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our baptists, who brought them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his puppet, the champion of Europe, Jana Pavlova, willingly agreed to show his rooms.
To complain on a big account is not something, - the impressions are shared by the deserved coach of Russia. - We live by two, the beds, of course, are almost in touch, but it's not critical.
Sunset one on four, but spacious.
The closet, of course, funny, made of fabric, trust does not cause, but things can be placed.
“No, you’re going, the tea is over!” – tells the tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, who met me at the main dining room.
The main is called at least because it represents an area of 2,7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
60,000 portions per day are delivered free of charge.
The options of the menu are as follows: "Best of Brazil", "Cuchins of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, Cake Products".
The last option, as I looked at, is very popular among our volleyball players.
At the same time, let’s say, the soups I haven’t found in any of the divisions of the giant restaurant.
What soup? - I am surprised. - There is no tea!
I'm glad I got the Chinese with me.
and the tea.
But in general, to understand, we have food even worse on the courts.
There is something to choose, despite unbearable uniformity.
I personally chose a flush for a pair and fricaducks in tomato sauce.
Near each dish is a table with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, to admit, it was good to eat.
I don’t even understand why such a turn stands all the time at the local McDonald’s.
Smooth, relaxed, can be said “heat” athletes are waiting for our best friends – representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The victory is a victory, the winner gets a shirt.
Provocating, can be said.
To get a gift, you need to answer correctly at least eight of the 10 questions.
There are questions in Russian! - a virgin from WADA attacked me.
But it didn’t attack it.
That is, I was in a patriotic break, of course.
The situation worsened by the second question: "If I got a notification of doping control passing, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I stopped on the option B: “No, I have one hour.”
I lost, to say, the vigilance.
I forget that we don’t have to wait for weaknesses from WADA.
In general, you need to be immediately.
At the seventh stage of Victorian, my position became quite critical.
I’ve somehow thought that if it’s hard for me to follow a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and it’s hard for me, by the way!), then I can use bio-supplements to get “add-on nutrients to improve my performance.”
No, don’t let them!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not prohibited, but strongly answered in several proposals.
It is unfair to play WADA!
What do you do, Russia? asks the leading victories.
There is no way to withdraw - behind Ephimov, Isinbayev and our whole disguised team.
So I focused and won the unfortunate shirt from my last strength.
Know what they say, our!
In a victorious mood, I went to a fitness center nearby.
I counted the trainers.
hit by 250.
He was surprised to note that no Russian athlete was found in this rounding of the running roads.
But maybe it is right?
Let the one who can’t play be trained.
But in the nearby clinic one of our boys sat.
In order to the oculist.
Don’t worry, not the shooter.
In the clinic, however, as throughout the village, wherever the plum is, an apparatus for the release of condoms is hanged.
On it is drawn an enthusiastic call: “Diddy with the condoms!”
The next remains to turn the iron, which resembles the door lock hand, and the preservative made of natural Latex of the Amazon is ready to fall out of the device.
I took myself alone for memory.
The athletes will not be upset - they have brought them 450 thousand.
Just for holidays and holidays there is an entire entertainment center in the Olympic village.
On the other hand, there is a recording table that reminds the International Olympic Committee of spending $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded by video games, billard and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices similar to video trains.
This is what? - I am interested in a friend in the form of an Ukrainian team, who actively uses a wild toy.
I could, of course, simply say that he doesn’t want to talk to a man in the form of a team of Russia, and all.
Here, by the way, according to some strange stretch of circumstances in the eyes of the kid in yellow-blue.
The most playing team is.
To get around the whole village, looking in every corner of it, it takes not less than three hours.
But if you’re just walking rather than driving on electric cars, you’ll be opened and the house of a Canadian collection with a loose at the entrance and a shatter with a restorative bathroom, and a ticket office, and a washing machine, and a washing machine, and a hairstylist, and a flower store, and a shop with daily consumption goods, and a mail with unique brands (only you’ll still be able to wait for the order from Chinese filatelists), and the bank, and the office of findings, and the photokyo.
And late in the evening, you will, obsessive, sit next to the olive tree, wrapped with colorful stripes in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who have left this world.
And you will be under the accompaniment of a machine, unregularly spraying liquid to kill insects, thinking of eternal.
About the Olympic Movement.
It doesn’t stop in this village for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world hidden breathing watched how the Australians almost did not punish the American Dream Team, real fans left the network.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in the rapper at the XXXI Olympics, I got the first.
Per I’m even the only Mosquevic who saw how it happened – without counting those, of course, who watched the competition that night in Carioca.
Only the real fan can understand this.
This is the dark Moscow night.
Neighbors from below – as always at night – wake up and start crying unwillingly, but very loudly to each other.
And threatening to move furniture.
In the kitchen is a cran - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the sandwich engineer asked, a new.
In the television schedule nothing is understood, so I just kept the control of the channels "Match", "First" and in any case "Russia" - although it is almost meaningless.
"Russia" is the homeland of repetitions, all the sport is there somehow in record.
The series are broadcast live.
Hope, of course, on the "Match" - the whole night the young man was screaming in news releases first about the great semi-final Deriglazov-Shanaev, then about the upcoming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead basketball is the US-Australia.
I can say nothing bad about this decision.
The Australians were equal, the first half won.
They put offenders from their own great American.
As a result, they lost, but, as they are now expressed, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It’s all good, but the battle with Di Francesca is approaching, and on the screen no changes.
In a slight panic, I start leaving the channels.
This feeling rotates for the second time in a row.
Go deep, on the cable.
There is no “match” on any of the themes.
And, according to my feelings, the battle is now starting.
Text and tweet broadcasts of some sports sites do not please me.
The windsurfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the "First" website, it turns out that all the competitions that take place at this moment of time are broadcasting.
I click on the flight, I get a battle for gold.
Deriglasova perfectly countertacks, goes forward by glasses - and obviously begins to take time.
The Italian has almost all the gap.
We are one point ahead, to the end a little more than two seconds.
Di Francesca is throwing on Deriglasova, the time ends, the Italian is throwing.
The victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone the fourth gold medal.
I am the first to see it with my own eyes.
Foolish, faithful and engaged.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenary commissioned its imams to conduct Friday prophecies only in Tatar, to force young Tatar to "learn their native language."
The administration says that this “not in any case infringes” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some Kazan mosques, it is said that up to 60% of prisoners do not understand the Tatar language, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatar themselves.
The Imams are afraid that their prophecies in Tatar will "not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday the Plenum of the DUM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to carry out Friday prophecies in the mosques of the Republic only in the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan Mufti Kamil Samigulin said, it should be an incentive for young Tatar to "learn their native language."
“For those who say that it’s hard, in every big mosque we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge,” Mr. Samigulin promised.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today in all mosques the prophecy “must be already in the Tatar language.”
He reminded that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical prophecies in the Tatar language.
The owner who doesn’t speak good enough in Tatar, “can prepare for it thoroughly.”
The DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the Muftia, Friday prophecies are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used mainly Russian.
Specifically, as Muftius indicated, this was practiced in the Burnaev mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mohamedshin stressed, the leadership puts the task that all students possess both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
“There cannot be a speech about any violation of the Muslim-Netator,” Mr. Muhammadeshin emphasized, explaining that the prophecy itself “is not a mandatory, fundamental part of the prayer.”
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and the mosques will keep lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Mohameshin said "Ъ" that there was no serious threat of the outsourcing of the Tatar language from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, according to his knowledge, are not used in the prophecies in the republic.
The decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCT).
The chief executive of the VKT, Rinat Zakirov, said: “The mosques are an important part of our national life.”
It would be sad if the Tatar language had gone out of this sphere.
He noted that the preaching is only in the Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves", but in the execution of the CCT "this is considered correct."
The questioned "Ъ" imam, who predicate in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the DUM, but believe that the priests will have difficulties with the understanding of the priests.
Tatar and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They will, of course, be sad.
“It will need to be reconstructed,” says Imam of the Burnaev Mosque, Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, the prophecy in the Russian language is closer even to many Tatar, since "Russian both in schools, and in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere from the beginning."
However, he believes that the mosques will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which will be held in other days.
We trust in Allah.
God will show a way out of this situation,” he concluded.
About 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are both the Uzbek, the Tajik and the Azerbaijani.
A lot of foreign students go to us: African, Arabs.
“Therefore, we have been four years as translated into the Russian language,” says Imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language the prophecies will “take to a narrow circle and will not reach the entire audience.”
But we will be subject to the decision of the Plenum.
The conclusion of the preaching will be different.
The time will show.
“For me, for example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my mother tongue,” Gabriel Galliulin concluded.
Former Chairman of the FSI was sentenced to court
The Prosecutor's Office of Moscow has approved the accusation on the investigated Criminal case of theft of budget funds allocated to the needs of the FSIN of Russia.

In order to steal budget money, the participants of the group developed a scheme according to which the under-control company FGUP CITOS, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and implemented at prices exceeding several times.
Despite the fact that the FGUP CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for placing production capacities, allowing to create a finished production cycle of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts were concluded between him and the FSIN of Russia for the amount of more than 3.3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme on the accounts of the Samarian branch of the FGUP was more than 2 billion rubles, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of funds received personally by Mr. Raymer in his office from one of the participants, the criminal case against which was assigned to a separate proceedings.

Igor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinema only for domestic films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, the tickets for which were 2-3 times less expensive than for foreign films,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for the audience with big Hollywood films.
We have more than 100 pictures per year, of which the screen reaches an average of 20-25 stripes.
“And it’s even very difficult for them to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, for the promotion of which huge budgets are charged,” the film director said.
On July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began working in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian directions from all over Russia and a number of countries in the near and far abroad.

As the "Ъ-South Ural" another lawyer of the accused - Sergey Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulich today called to the investigative department of the SCR of Mijas to submit an accusation in the case of a year-long date of the battle.

The Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK took for the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally “dirty” enterprises in the country – the Karabash Medeplavil Combinate.
The Karabash Medeplavil Factory was founded by the British shareholders under the leadership of Leslie Urkhart in 1910.
In Soviet times it was a significant industrial enterprise for the economy of the country, and it actually provided the vitality of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, causing serious social problems in Karabach.
In 1998 the decision was made to renew the work of the Karabakh Medeplavil Combinate.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabach was already sadly known as the environmental disaster zone.
The situation on Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company passed under the management of the Russian copper company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the first numbers of July.
The head of the Southern Ural called the great changes that have occurred with the enterprise since "Karabashmed" passed into the group of the RMK.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years was the construction of a new serum-oxid plant, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company Allowlod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of the modernization of the ZOO "Karabashmed" - the reconstruction of the converter transfer.
The replacement of three converters, pipelines, and gas pipeline is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016 it is planned to launch a new cleaning facility of industrial goods worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amounts of taxes deposited in the budget of the city of Karabakh will also increase.
For the entire period of implementation of the Tominsky GOC project - from the beginning of construction and until the entry into operation of the second row - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the introduction of the GOC into operation the income of taxes in the budgets of all levels can amount to 80,9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varna region in the budgets of different levels listed 346.3 million rubles.
This is for the first year.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering the issue of imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation because of the hacking of democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering the issue of introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party servers, the Wall Street Journal writes with reference to sources.
For sanctions, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama will have to officially accuse the attack on servers of Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence services are practically confident in Russia’s involvement in the cyber attack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefer not to name those who are carrying out hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 collapse of the database of Sony Entertainment Pictures, which was officially liable to the North Korea.
However, last year, Obama issued a decree that simplified the procedure for sanctions against those who carry out or promote cyber attacks.
It was initially directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be long, the publication writes.
Even if officials came to the conclusion that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before they make a decision on disclosure they will have to bear the possible consequences.
They will have to determine whether the incident is so serious that it will aggravate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was that the administration of Barack Obama permits the possibility of sanctions against the state whose hackers broke the servers of the Democratic Party’s National Committee.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the National Democratic Committee.
The media that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS punishes Google by almost half a billion rubles
The cause was a violation of competition in the mobile app market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated on the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the pre-installation of apps from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position on the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install along with the Google Play store other apps.
According to the results of the inspection, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service has decided to punish Google, FAS Deputy Chairman Alexei Docenko said.
The penalty must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the ruling.
The FAS concluded that the law on competition protection should be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first explore the solution and only then will be determined with further actions: implement it or challenge it.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service recognized the company as a violator of the law on competition in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not give consent to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting a trial.
The FAS noted that, despite the fines, they are discussing with Google the possibility of a world deal.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This opinion was expressed by the leading analyst of the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat's "anime" effect is criticized as a cartoon on Asian people
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some viewers say it is racist.
With the “Linz” tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border with absurdity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, a dog, or a character in a painting of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, scratching features tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfie per day.
Every mistake becomes quickly known.
Snapchat lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of the face or encouraging the white face as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered this week a lens that wrapped them with hairy eyes, curved teeth, and swollen gloves, some critics regarded it as a racist cartoon on the Asians—the “gloves.”
And they were wondering whether these repeated contradictions indicate a more serious diversity-related company problem.
On Wednesday, messages and traces of annoyance spread in the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the next day after Snapchat said they had deleted this feature.
The company commented: the lens was conceived as an honor to the characters of the anime, not as a cartoon to the Asian.
But to experts who know about racism, the lens reminded of insulting stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was actively shared, said that the lens was "insulting and at least uncomfortable."
She added that "it was difficult to compare side by side of a very rough cartoon on the Asian and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowlithium, but in the highest degree destroys yellowlithium.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate halls to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with.
And a huge audience of young people on Snapchat – who are more racially diverse than their older generation – may mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of Snapchat lenses creates an insulting image for the user, then, Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, “this course of events is much more difficult to remain unnoticed than it was before.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works on Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and called on others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity in the collection of personnel in Snape.
Zhu criticized the mainly white management of the company, consisting only of men, and finished her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who is the American of Chinese origin, wrote: "Of they didn't have enough people in the state to make such decisions, or they work with people in the sky, but they don't take such positions that can be said safely and openly."
Other viewers share her point of view, expressing disappointment that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The Company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, highlighting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to a trusted person, the company recently hired recruitors to focus on insufficiently represented populations and on active attempts to engage internal resources.
Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding: "I'm wondering if they really need more users like us so that they can say that it's not going."
Military leadership distorted the intelligence of ISIS, reports the congress committee
Officials from the Central Command of the U.S. Armed Forces modified the intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they give the ground for the events on the site, the congress commission said in a report released on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Republican presidents of the Committee of the House of Representatives for Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee for Military Assignments, found a "breadly widespread dissatisfaction" among the Central Command Intelligence Service analysts who claim that the leaders were misleading their assessments of U.S. actions aimed at victory over the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centom, is the main military administration in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the Centcom’s top command generally gave a more optimistic image of U.S. anti-terrorist actions than the real data from the site of the events confirmed, and were stably more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence services,” the report said.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with unreliable analysis, our military suffers,” said Ken Calvert, a member of the House of Representatives, a Republican from California.
Problems with the management at Centcom reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report detailed the shortcomings constantly arising in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of the U.S. actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain any definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration had ordered to falsify reports, he claims that analysts felt that the Centcoma leadership forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly said that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After months of investigation, this is known,” the House of Representatives member Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the highest head of the intelligence service of the U.S. Central Command falsified the intelligence documents of the command to mitigate the threat by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they found out that analysts expressed concern that the Islamic State intelligence was falsified.
As the investigation is advanced, the report published on Thursday will follow more elaborate data.
The additional, unfinished investigation of the intelligence center is carried out by the chief inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress published their own data on Thursday, which agree with some of the findings of the Republican operational group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning ISIS and Iraqi security troops," the House of Representatives member Adam B. Shiff, the chief representative of the Democratic Party in the committee said in a statement.
This procedure, according to Schiff, "shakened the release of intelligence documents", damaged the moral state of the analysts and "not sufficiently reflects the divergent views."
But Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have not found any evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom’s analysts to submit their conclusions to “a task- or political interpretation.”
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by the Daily Beast portal.
Last August, the New York Times the existence of an investigation of the chief inspector of the Pentagon, opened after the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Deputy Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense will not comment on Congress's report as long as the chief inspector's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree in their opinions when interpreting comprehensive data, and the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues related to national security.”
The results of the investigation are beyond the question of whether the target of the U.S. bombing in Iraq and Syria is achieved (as more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defense now claim).
But last year’s statements cause doubts whether President Obama can rely on the fact that the Central Command provides true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the Islamic State intelligence repeats the disputes that had occurred more than a decade ago when the intelligence center analyst Gregory Hucker wrote a research article claiming that the administration of President George W. Bush, due to the protests of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hucker also played a key role in the protests caused by the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, according to officials, the Hooker team came to the conclusion that despite public statements of the reverse, air strikes on the Islamic State oil refuels did not lead to a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the terrorist group because it built temporary oil refuels to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not spread beyond the Central Command, as the newspaper Times in September.
The then Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after witnesses in the Senate, which many Deputies considered an excessively optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins four consecutive victories in women’s hockey on the grass, thus approaching a decisive battle with Britain.
Getting once three goals in a match that ended with a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bamm opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. team on women's hockey on the grass, when the Americans won the Indian team with a 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bamm says she’s not sure if she’ll ever do something like that.
“I don’t use my mind,” she said.
I am not actually one of those people who track their goals.
This is what she knows: counting the Americans 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbeatable after Japan's defeat with the score 2-0 on Thursday.
The teams of Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim for the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will occupy the first place in their group of six teams and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid encounters with a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, a bit of time when the quarter-final games begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans made noise here with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Ben was in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a hole for grass hockey when she was 3 (her older twins played this kind of sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn’t pass the selection to the final.
Then it came in 2012, when everything didn’t go well with her and her team colleagues.
The following year, Coeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as a coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, changes in physical training,” she said.
In London, we didn’t have the productivity that we are now.
We completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bamm opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand on a short distance.
India approached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly hard and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bamm took the initiative into his hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then on the spiral entered the middle and sharply sent the ball to the gate, thus giving the Americans the advantage in 2-0.
Melissa González added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first in the tournament for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is in shock.
Just like BAM.
"We are in good position right now," Parnhem said, but how good it is depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the disagreement of the Olympic Games - "den" jumping on the battle
Wherever you are, no matter how long it is now, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanged and unavoidable, it is a mixture of competition and aspiration.
It’s like the Olympic fire itself and it’s the burning fire that is transmitted from the lightning to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbors’ conversation in a cafe and don’t hear about Simone Bailes, Katie Ledy, or about the enemy between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
There is also Logan Dolly.
Dolly, the first to participate in the Olympic Games, a beautiful man with the shells on the shells, could well be among those celebrity showed in the premium-time, promoted by sponsors and life-confirming advertising rolls, whether he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a fighter.
But the 28-year-old Dolly from Lake Forest, California, is struggling for gold in the Olympic matches on the battle.
The Olympic fire does not light all events in the same way.
Beyond the center, in part in the shadow, there are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting with a pneumatic pistol, shooting with a bulk, badminton, thekvondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long rule.
But if I’m allowed to speak rough in defending my personal addiction, let me turn your attention to the modest charm of the jump on the bowl.
Although jumping on the bowl has been an Olympic sport since 2000 when they debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people surveyed by me have not been aware that they are generally related to the Olympic sports.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in the battle jump, and their athletes did not come to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually share male awards, and Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Dun Dun from China and Rose McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the jump on the batut has the charm of the outsider, especially because for the uneducated ear they are more associated with the circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, but just a landed enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential—it is a cartoon of endless jumping—but also the elegance of gymnastics and water jumping, two types of sports that they mainly combine in themselves.
The word “batute” comes from the Spanish word “el trampolín”, meaning “tramplin for jumping into the water”.
The candidates for victory jump on a giant batut, flying in the air for almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (reversions, slides and salto) until the final landing on their feet.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and “flight time,” according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
The candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forward, there and here on the field.
They are pursuing not only to the final line or the starting wall, but also, in view of the telecams, to another irritating margin: the world record or the Olympic record.
This persistent aspiration is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatic – and it is enough to force even the spectator to follow.
But I think it is a bit tired when watching the games.
The jump on the bowl gives him a breath.
The direction of the batutist is upward.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she is jumping, it seems unwilling, like an astronaut, flying up, then down, then without an effort again up.
And in them, of course, it does not go without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no mad riding to the finish, no jumping in length, only a wonderful, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the most close to Zen Olympic sport.
Women's qualification competitions, and then the final will be held on Friday day, broadcast at the hour of the day in Eastern European time; men's - on Saturday, also at the hour.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the daily program starting from 14:00 on both days.
At the height of the Olympic madness, a quiet, wonderful moment is expected, which can be easily seen in the general slope.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to desirable views and objectivization—as, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently assumed by U.S. high school men—Dolly is only waiting for its new admired crowd of fans.
“Generation protests” in Ethiopia, a long-standing U.S. ally
Furious protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators, calling for political change in Ethiopia, faced a fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were deadly wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the edge of division?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shocked the country, spreading to increasing numbers of its territories.
Only in the last week thousands of people went out to the streets, calling for radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the government’s reaction was cruel.
Witnesses claim that police officers shot down dozens of unarmed protesters.
The videos from the protest sites, supposedly taken at the end of last year or early this year, show how security officers kill young people with puzzles when they were placed with their hands to the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from disintegration, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, the head of the African Horn project in the international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability isined by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is developing with an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Abeba.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly an example of democracy – human rights organizations constantly mention government repressions – the opposition on the territory of the state was interrupted by the fact that the dissidents were actually forced to silence.
Many of them were sent, imprisoned, killed or expelled into remote deserts.
But that can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and they do not leave them any other option than to protest, the rebellion will rise,” said Seum Teshome, a lecturer at the University in Central Ethiopia.
All the youth protests.
The generation protests.
The complaints are numerous, starting from land use, ending with the capture of power by a government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely suppressed the opposition and now control 100% of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has caught hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts are afraid that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromos Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit anxiety and rearmed themselves.
A number of factors explain why gorgeous feelings, for several years boiling in the depths of the soul, are burning now.
The first would seem completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become common, and the internet service has become better.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they were organized for the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Orom and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Thro the centuries, Amhara from the mainly Christian mountainous regions of Ethiopia has prospered in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in low regions.
But that also changes.
“We’re going to act together under a single beginning,” said MULATU HEMECU, the leader of Oromos.
The major protests took place in the districts of Amhara and Orom.
Many of Amhara and Oromos feel that Etiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tiger ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaway.
Meles, the former rebellion leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could predict danger.
Analysts claim that he skillfully recognised the first signals of dissatisfaction and used intelligence to obtain data and dismantle opponents.
“The current regime lacks good sense,” said Abdi, an analyst of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemariam Desalyan, appeared nonewhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was a native from the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia, Heilmariam is a southern man.
Analysts say he does not use the trust of the Tiger-controlled security services.
Many are afraid that this will result in even more blood flow.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such anxiety was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said seemed to be elections that the government shut down and then falsified the results.
During the subsequent repressions many Protestants were killed, although in a smaller number compared to the last months, and this period of tensions passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed their gratitude to the Ethiopian leaders for the long-looking development of infrastructure, such as the new cross-city train and significant successes in the fight against poverty.
But it is obvious that this did not stop the growth of internal dissatisfaction by the government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondara, the city of Amhara, attacked the Tigers-owned enterprises, and anti-Tigers hatred on social networks becomes comprehensive.
Analysts say the protesters put the United States and other Western allies in uncomfortable situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand it does not want its ally to lose power in the already unstable region.
“And it will be hard to pass through this stretched channel,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that the Islamic State was founded by Obama, "Sarkaz"
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict that covered his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was a joke when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founder” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican party’s presidential candidate to reasonably address the American people.
It also put his supporters, who tried to protect him during the period of excitement, in an unpleasant situation, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Speaking this assumption at the congress on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a post on Twitter early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just driving.
This post was the direct opposite of the claim made just a day earlier when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accusation.
When radio-conservative Hugh Height tried to help Trump soften the speech, reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate for the presidency did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to reorient his campaign on the economy on the background of a rating decline.
Trump and Clinton spoke with competing talks on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic again.
Again appealing to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and said that he found her speech boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he got out of general criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should break Clinton’s email, he later explained his comments, saying, “Naturally, I’m joking.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond the limits permitted in a political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way to test those messages that find a response among his fans, to see how they act, and then to “explain” them in one way or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who conducted the language analysis of both candidates.
But I also think that he is cautious in his statements and knows that they are sufficient to treat them differently.
Instead of mitigating the speeches for the widespread electorate, Trump has taken even more harsh tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new rating of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Trump goes down with Clinton with a big overweight in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and goes with her to the level in Florida.
While Trump is usually trying not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has become the subject of increased attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, his jokes have put his faithful allies in a disadvantage: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements are.
Rudolf W. Julian, a former New York mayor, who is one of Trump’s most famous deputy, has made serious efforts to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I think what he says is an acceptable political comment,” Julian said when he was asked about the reliability of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a unknown small organization, he called it a non-threatening, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it all happened, because he brought troops out of Iraq.
The majority of the average Republicans claim that the Obama administration, in which Clinton was the secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop as it failed to resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Before a meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for disturbing each of his words and prejudice to him.
He scared on the “poor unfortunate” television experts who are trying to find it out, and said, “They are weak!”
Some Democrats laughed on Trump’s excuses as an extra confirmation that he was not fit for the presidents.
Once Upon a Time Coffee Returns to Greenpoint
The “Werb” coffee shop was overwhelming, taking only cash places in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pulled out of her room with a window on the Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri store, which took place in Verb in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of cakes.
Local residents paid it as the last loss in the renewed city.
Artist Molly Krabbl wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store."
But while New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is updating.
The Renaissance Cafe "Verb" opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and receives credit cards, but there remained some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The head of the new "Verb" is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager on the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the customers offered to promote him on a new place, he said he would be happy to go on it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, has left a lot in his former form.
Verb works with the same beagle distributor and bought the same model of the coffee machine.
It even installed lights from the old "Verb".
But Rodriguez said he would also want to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
In the menu are presented sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are toppings from peppers or peanut butter.
There is a meal of brown rice.
There is no more beer in the coffee shop, but now fresh juices are cooked.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he was paying attention to the unchanged flow of old permanent customers.
“Many former customers were also issued with prices from Williamsberg,” he said.
In one of the recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, previously lived in Williamsberg and frequently visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After closing Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that inspired me in Verbe,” she said.
Now she’s drinking coffee again, though that day instead of the usual ice coffee she ordered a bathed tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been dedicated to visiting the Verb, starting in 2003.
He entered before work and ordered the same thing constantly.
“At the fifth minute of eight, every day, as in time, I came, and for me they cooked my beagle with oil and with all the snacks,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes a ordinary order, but someday he changes something with the help of bacon, eggs or cheese on the beagle with all the compounds.
Rodriguez said he was not insulting that the soap store once occupied the old place.
Moreover, Soup Sheri’s owners proposed to make a special soap for Verba, using coffee made in a cold way as an ingredient.
“I think we may agree with their proposal,” Rodriguez said.
Permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this coffee.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for him in the window so that his new neighbors would feel desirable.
The new place has other benefits.
The local juice sale point plans to float the bottles and sell coffee cooked in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whit was a permanent client and shared that he was killed badly when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whit said that when he entered and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
“How long I wanted to feel that smell,” he admitted.
Depressive meals of depression in the flat meal
In March 1933, shortly after the rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat to lunch in the Oval Cabinet.
As a gourman, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable Five Avenue dishes, for example, the fua-gra and the Maryland scratch soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: fermented eggs in tomato sauce, potato pyre and for a dessert - pudding from black.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "This was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in food history.
The last book of Kowa, "Ragu in Chinese", was dedicated to Chinese cuisine in America, and Ziegelmann told the story of life in a film apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book "House 97 on the Street Fruit Garden".
Their new joint work “The Floor Table”, which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing somewhat their own culinary solidarity, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a small snack shop in the Flatyron Quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of the Stock Exchange Crash.
Ziegelmann, 54, ordered salmon cheese and butterbread with pieces of olive, and Kou, 57, took an indian, potato pire and a vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for the discussion of food in the Age of Depression.
“Rulets were in great demand,” said Ziegelmann.
There was arachis roulette, liver roulette, bean roulette.
They were made of the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to spread.
Imagine you’ve eaten as much orange as you need for dinner.
Koe was murdered.
“Maybe he was lying in his stomach with a stone,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women prepared the farm for men-workers, and the fresh baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. The “Flat Table” describes how the country faced that suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for the Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as difficult: mysterious dishes, such as roulette and bakery, became the main food; bakery is a “beautiful way to eliminate the snacks,” Ziegelmann noted, because the cook could hide the unpleasant ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dry fruits.
Meat, which for many years was the foundation of American food, has become a economically distributed luxury.
People tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary healthy sense.
Researching for a book that contains recipes, Ziegelmann prepared the dish of that era: a baked cabbage, fermented with arachide oil.
“This supplement to the dining table was not successful,” Kou said.
Ziegelman added: “It was very strange.”
The arachide oil is not suitable for the liver.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
As never before and never since then, household experts – including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of households from 1923 to 1943 – managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers”, take a challenge and turn a burdock like spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
The “Flat Meal” is a plot of interesting historical facts.
Particularly picant stories about the government’s reaction to hungry citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Gouver in the spirit of “Let the cake eat.”
Publicly exaggerated by the simple farmer's branch of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he ate himself as the finest millionaire he became.
“He liked the continental cuisine, for example, fish with corn sauce,” Koe said.
He eaten almost in a sweetened dining room, carrying smoking.
He was fantastically distracted from reality.
President Roosevelt could make the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, did not advise him to give an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleonora Roosevelt hired an economist who was not interested in the taste, and this led to the fact that the White House "consumed not only the most disgraceful food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgracefully cooked."
Many of the culinary recipes of the Age of Depression were forgotten as soon as the country rose again.
Their inheritance is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Ziegelmann, and on how science has been used in cooking.
The spouses tell that during the writing of the book they better understood the eating habits of Ziegelmann’s mother—that she couldn’t throw out food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of negligent attitude to food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman remembers, “She seriously poisoned people.”
There was one unpleasant case with the profiles.
When the plates in Eisenberg's were empty, they and Coe got the dessert they cooked at home: the dessert of black grapes that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“This is called the mus of black,” Ziegelmann said, adding that it was a common reception – giving modest recipes brush names.
There were no melted milk, only black, a bit of flour, sugar, water and cortex.
Everyone with desire drowned a teaspoon into a whiskey, brown, liquefied substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
She asked for supplements twice.
With the voice of the confident budget maker, he said to his wife, "A little rubled Greek nuts would not interfere here."
The arrest of the victims of the mass struggle at the Havan Cemetery extended to November 14
The Presen court left the figureants of the mass struggle in the Havan cemetery under arrest until November 14, satisfying the corresponding request of the investigation.
14 persons are charged as accused.
On 14 May, a mass struggle between several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons occurred at the Havan Cemetery, killing three people.
Former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Aleksandr Bocharnikov have been charged with organizing murder.
The question of the second indexation of pensions for 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was on August 12, Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters on how much we need to raise the pension to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now the economists are putting out the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks,” he said.
Commenting on the proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Development by Alexey Kudrin the scheme to raise the retirement age for six years each year, the Vice-President said that this topic is not discussed in the cabinet.
At the end of July it became known that the Government agreed on the position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.

The Turkish opposition Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation of the circumstances of the attempt to a coup in Turkey.
"I demand an independent international commission to conduct an investigation of a coup attempt," Gulen quoted the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also said that "if some of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen in every way denies his involvement in the state revolt, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The court in Istanbul previously arrested the opposition Islamic prophet Fethullah Gülen.
The attempt to a military coup took place in Turkey in the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead will reimburse advocacy costs during a patent dispute with Merck for hepatitis C
Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to receive reimbursement of the costs for the lawyer's services that it carried in connection with the breach on the issue of a hepatitis C medicine with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc., a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was released from paying $200 million in damages for the violation of Merck’s two patents relating to Gilead’s drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the U.S. judge found a number of infringements by Merck, including lies and other unethical acts.
When appealing to the court on Thursday, the federal court judge Beth Lebson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to reimburse the costs incurred during the dispute.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck were brought to court against each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work based on Sophosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s medicines.
Armed forces created with U.S. support claim to have overtaken the full control of Mumbai from the Islamic State.
The armed forces created with U.S. support have captured full control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city after the remaining group of militants hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were held by terrorists, Reuters Sharphan Darwish from the Allied with the SDS Military Council of Manbij.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are undergoing cleaning operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her tax declarations for 2015, which showed that the Democratic Party candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in the form of charity contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in the form of honors for his speeches, and former Secretary of State declared a $3 million income from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her stay in the State Department.
The potential vice president Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, published the tax declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard of financial transparency,” Clinton’s pre-election headquarters adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In full opposite, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and breaches his past promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is a common thing for presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the State Tax Service's check as the reason he refused to publish his tax declarations.
“Your move,” Clinton’s presidential counselor, Jan Sams, wrote on Twitter, referring to the declaration of a candidate from the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the checks were completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican president candidate Mitta Romney and other Republican colleagues, said his rejection raises questions about his state, his charity contributions, his business operations and other relations, including with Russia.
Clinton captured the question and on Friday released an online video in which the main place was given to the outstanding Republicans who persuaded Trump to publish the tax report.
She raised this question during a speech on the economy in Michigan on Thursday.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades without exception: to publish his tax declarations," she said.
The Politico newspaper that Trump didn’t pay any or almost any taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business researcher on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants who believed that it might be the case for now.
The federal tax stakes became the subject of dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule named in honor of the billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year will pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, offered Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also under the IRS check, and that Trump "threatened" not the tax collection agencies, but the voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters published tax declarations until 2007.
Clinton, who currently lives in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and an effective total tax rate of about 40,5 percent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 from their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, and Clinton announced dividends and $109,000 capital revenues.

Conservatives with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmental fighters in Tanzania use a non-traditional way to prevent elephants from getting blind in settlements – throwing preservatives filled with chili powder into them.
The method turned out to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came into mind this idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. Nature Conservation Committee took on its promotion, training volunteers in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and seeds without causing harm to animals.
Many people used copies to protect themselves.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we have invented a set of tools ... we have seen a change in the relationship within these communities, which has made them much more confident that they will not be able to leave the elephants on their fields without causing harm to the elephants,” Honeyguide CEO Demian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps consists in burning the fake in front of the border violated elephant and sending signals with the corner.
If it could not be scared, then the so-called "Chili Cloud" is thrown.
The chili powder, mixed with soil, is placed with a cotton in the preservative, and its end is turning, outside only the fithil remains.
When burning, the preservative is broken with hot, spraying a small dust of chili powder in the air.
One thinning is usually enough to spread the elephant to the other side.
The ultimate measure is a launch device that shoots the Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
There are 32 Turkish diplomats who have left the country after a coup attempt in July.
Such data was brought by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Chavushoglu in a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we withdrawed 208 personnel diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of them, 32 people have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," the head of the Turkish foreign policy department said.
In July, a coup d'état attempted in Turkey.
The country’s authorities have officially stated that the coup failed, and also the arrest of more than six thousand people, including the military officers of the high and middle units.
As a result of the coup attempt, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people were killed.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing the Israeli telephone code on the "prayer" of the Arabs, RT News.
A French director of Jewish origin raised a scandal in the media when he found that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin has no Israeli telephone code list, with the servants referring to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzman, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust Show, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel in the hotel’s telephone code list.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question on the hotel administration stand.
The answer he got there, according to Lanzman, “shocked him.”
Hotel Clerk said that this measure was "a thoughtful decision of the management of the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind this step caused even greater anger of the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded the code of Israel to be removed,” said Lanzman, a hotel servant.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a terrible shame," the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
This is actually a terrible shame.
What this happened in Germany and in this hotel network is even bigger shame.
No explanations are needed here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply "goed up" with the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“I’d be ashamed,” it was said in another post, indicating that the hotel, located on the glorious street of Kurfurstendamm, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel himself has rushed to reject any accusations, calling the incident "unobserved" and "apologized" to Lanzman, the Der Spiegel newspaper reports.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of fast assembly," the Kempinski hotel spokesman told the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
He added that the code was added.
Police use tear gas and gums to protest Brazilian students
Students met with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against government reforms of the state education system.
Police used tear gas and gums against the protesters.
Disorders began when police officers tried to dismiss students, resulting in police using gums and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen behind writing on the walls a graphite directed against the temporary president Michael Temer.
This last protest occurred just a few days after the protesters massively went out to support the rejected President Dilma Rousseff, when the country’s Senate voted for her impiction.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71% - RT Business reports
With the cancellation of the sanctions, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan said.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been removed, there is an increase in interest from the Russian firms to conduct business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new companies are ready to get access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that this year a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia.
Last year, the diplomatic representation of Russia in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist, to citizens of Iran.
In addition, for the first time, Iran has entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It can be said with certainty that last year’s record in the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be hit,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which, the ambassador hopes, will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yez, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization are kept in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to turn the haik in the defence-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure to fulfill” of the duties of the Director-General of the Group “Almaz-Antey”, “the dismissal” and “the loss of confidence”.
Gennady Bendersky is appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
The information about the dismissal of Necradov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause broad resonance in the media.
How can we explain this silence in the context of a massive rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the Russian leadership does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This again confirms that the defense and industrial complex (OPC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from the society to them.
The removal of the Negrodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of order in the industry.
The NGO "Almaz" is the main enterprise of the group, which specializes in the production of anti-missile complexes (ZRK) of marine and ground-based base.
Currently, “Almaz” is working on the creation of the “Polyment-Reduce” and “Morpheus” ZRKs, which are planned to be installed on new corvets, fregates, destroyer and cruiser.
The founder of the Military Russia portal Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Nekrodov was caused by a break of deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007 and the introduction was planned in 2013.
"Polyment-Redut" should become the main air defense system on the latest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I get, in several years of tests, no truly successful test has been done.
The truth is, to the extent I can judge, that’s not the unclear fault of Almaz,” Kornev said.
The expert is concerned that the delay with the entry into operation may occur with the S-500 railway station.
Experience-constructive work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes must enter the army.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is planned and everything will be completed within the time limits," although in 2014 the ministry recognized the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the professional qualities of Nekrodov, who has led "Almaz" since 2011.
Kornev stated that the breaks of deadlines for projects could be both the reason and the reason for the dismissal.
According to him, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about the internal processes in the OPC and the plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as you know, loves silence.
As a rule, the directors of defense companies leave their positions on their own desire, under the agreement of the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place publicly, although it did not receive a resonance.
This pushes the idea that the head of the "Almaz" was a striptease figure and resisted the "runs" that were down from above.
It seems that the state is no longer committed to such a behavior.
With the hands of the shareholders it will remove those who prefer to dispute with the Ministry of Defense facilities and do not perform the assigned tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the provoked managers (machinations on the shipwreck "Star").
More attention is paid to the sector’s issues by the president personally.
Vladimir Putin is the head of the Military and Industrial Commission and regularly holds meetings dedicated to rearmament.
The Kremlin defends a number of leaders of the OPC, seeking to have a loyal composition of directors at hand, which will carry out the orders obtained above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but in the background of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the OPC there are no other instruments in the state.
The situation in the defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation will stimulate the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
Parallel to the "cleaning" of managers in the OPC, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of Sergei Shoigu as defense minister.
It is impressive that the president took the famous proverb "If you want peace, prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which consolidated behind Moscow the spheres of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system it worked quite effectively.
The evidence of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The celebration of the "winners" in the Cold War eventually turned into the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terror attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, there is no one quiet corner left.
Despite the common trouble, the West refuses to negotiate with Russia at the level of equal partner.
Under these conditions, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and the army.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and go to new boundaries of world policy.
Scotch Calum Skinner runs on the final straight, resulting in British capturing bicycle gold
The Scotch Calum Skinner wrecked to triumph in the male team sprint on a bicycle in Rio last evening, resulting in Britain's team trio defending his 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old Glazgo was in the role of the strongest that his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly entered the story, shining the final line to break the victory in the favourite team of New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoi declared the right to a fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick, after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Championship on track wheels in London, despite the fact that Hoy has since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of the specialist participant Jamie Staff.
They did so just in the time when the Hindes appeared.
Hoi’s care also created the emptiness that Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was followed by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland that was now realized.
Hendes, Kenny — champions with Hoi four years ago — and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualification, but the norm was overcome by New Zealand in the first round.
The British trio won a duel for gold.
Hinde was right behind after his round, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hinde was driving on a larger transmission to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep the pace.
He observed from his place as a BBC invited expert and captured the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hinde when they entered the pedestal.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “This is a steep comparison.”
I am here to do everything I can and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012 along with Kenny and Hoy, Hendes acknowledged intentionally fell on the track after a failed start.
He later refused to comment, and there was no way to appeal from the British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Heinz said, “I felt like I was in London, with all the British flags on the tribune.”
We have all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost in so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven of the 10 nominations in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the bicycle is waiting for another five successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it is not beyond the possibility to imagine how he repeats the Hoi's performance, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would allow you to see how Kenny — who is just 12 years younger than Hoi, who was also born on March 23 (this seems a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Banister) — leads his account to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoi.
The next time Kenny competes in the sprint, which starts today and is played for three days.
The 28-year-old out of Bolt said, “I just enjoy it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your friends.
A little to win alone, if honestly.
He said, “If he wins another two gold medals, he must get the Knight.”
This was the only day in which the medals were played, but the following were good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified as the fastest four-kilometre team race of persecution by four.
They finished at 3:51.943.
The world record established during the 2012 London gold win was 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 pm) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be at the center of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, before the qualification trip, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the corresponding women's event, which is renewed and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katy Archibald from Millgava improved the world record by showing time 4:13.260.
The team of Britain came to the fact that it relies on a powerful team of cyclists to take into possession the middle period of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After indeed exceptional demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas on the second plan, not the last - the withdrawal from the post of technical director Shane Satton in April due to accusations of sexism and intimidation, and the withdrawal of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening race on the bicycle, it seems that the legendary now glory of Britain in achieving the heights at the right time may just be repeated again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is threatened due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium plant in Victoria – as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers – is threatened because the electricity company that supplies the factory, according to one of the factory owners, is going to terminate the delivery contract: it is planned that all the delivery contracts will be terminated.
This step is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the government of Victoria not to extend the subsidies granted to support the operation of the factory.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened at the Alcoa factory in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — may be in a risk zone due to any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metal factory in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in Angles last year.
The Portland metal factory of Alcoa is losing money and risks closure.
These actions have been the result of thought on the future of the factory, which has been ongoing for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later due to the price of the factory’s products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, said it is expected that the other three owners will also take steps to terminate the contract.
The control share of the factory is owned by the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp are owned by smaller shares.
“AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to work, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical factory will not cease,” she said.
According to AGL, the aforementioned contracts are so-called ‘hegged contracts’ which had to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“As a result, AGL still expects that these contracts will bring part of its income in the 2017 financial year,” the electricity company said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits from the 2018 financial year to the present time is limited by forecasts on the strong future market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it has already reduced the amount of the contracts in its reporting by $187 million in terms of “the upcoming termination.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to manage a metallurgical plant or provide electricity to a metallurgical plant.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was planned to enter into force in November of this year, but it still has to explain why it has terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metal factory in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle due to the negative economic situation in the industry.
Referring to analysts earlier this week, AGL operating service chief Stephen Mickelson said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, and Tomago - about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant decline in demand on the [electricity] market.
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only the reality show star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September number of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, a model and the fourth daughter of the Clan Kardashian-Jenner mother-manager Chris, appeared on the desired September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, which is the face of the brand Estee Lauder and defiled on the fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
“When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at that cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news of the cover was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the “Cardashian Family?”), prepared reality-video, in which the whole family of the Cardashian-Jenner (Rob and Catherine, who also joined them, the most popular show-business uncle, the producer of the “Cardashian Family” Ryan Sikrest), forgot about the appearance of a sister on the cover, and in the end - a classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
This is a standard story line of almost all episodes of children's TV shows dedicated to their birthday (Secret speaks the phrase: "Do you think we've forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit from the show at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed that glory somehow reached other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September number of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Cardacian show.
Let the older sister of Kendall Kim and hit the Vogue cover earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Canyon West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of Vogue in the year.
Similar to a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionista portal, 615 pages of last year’s 832-page edition contained advertising).
The news about who of the stars will fall on his cover is expected with such uncertainty that in the last two years the photographs of the magazine have merged to the official announcement.
The previous women on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been presented with more “famous people working as models” than “famous people working as models”.
The Oscar winner and Dior’s face, Jennifer Lawrence, was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga fell.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, which the magazine described as a "publishing model" of its generation, falls in the first category, she is in a bad company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are truly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, who appeared on the last year cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, due to her past reality show star, has always had to remain shake.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the shots of the moment."
These moods again flourished after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it is not meaningful to engage in dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue number.
She is a supermodel in all the meanings of this word.
She defiles for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all of her sisters, sell their photos to you in their same apps available on a paid subscription.
She sells self-made photos of the daughter of Cindy Crawford to the LOVE magazine.
And in the free time, maybe to still see her sister Curtney and her children, she is taking part in a reality show on TV.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 the least protected representatives of the population refuse to serve in public legal centers, as this sector is preparing for an effect that will give further cuts of funding on and so already underway activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who do not have the ability to fight unfair property deprivation and so on – have already been rejected, trying to get free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services, which are already working beyond opportunities, are preparing for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of the Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that according to the latest report of the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people per year receive rejection.
Farrell said that if the decision of the federal government is not cancelled, the situation will only worsen.
“Queensland’s public legal centers are constantly receiving insufficient funding: that means thousands of people are rejected from the vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and devastating debts, families passing through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers—all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017 and thus, thousands of less protected residents in Queensland will be forced to solve complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brands to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the financing of free legal assistance to the country’s average.
Now it is time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their customers, and the Palashuk government is time to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's presidential headquarters was brought to court after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, the presidential headquarters of Donald Trump was brought to court: the headquarters did not do anything after the report that his operating director in North Carolina threatened a staff with a gun when they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit to the state court in Charlotte on Wednesday by Vincent Bordeaux, a former software instructor at the state’s pre-election headquarters.
Bordeaux said he waited a few months to resolve the problem in an internal order, but he realized that "this will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "raised the pistol, placed his right indicative finger on the curcumin and sent the duel on Vincent's knee cup," Bordeaux said in a complaint.
After appealing to the local and regional administration of the presidential staff, Bordeaux realized that at least four more people were involved in similar incidents with Philip.
“Pistols don’t need to shoot to cause damage,” Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after the Republican party’s presidential candidate made a furor, saying to the North Carolina audience that “The People of the Second Amendment” – understood as weapons owners and its fans – can begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and can choose judges.
Trump’s presidential headquarters said the media had removed his words from the context and that he did not speak in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordeaux demands compensation from the presidential staff for negligent control, and from Philip for the threat of physical violence, offensive by action and causing moral harm.
Trump’s Representative, Hope Hicks, is slowly responding to a request to comment.
The attempts to talk to Philip did not succeed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, that Philip recently left the presidential headquarters.
In response to the call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called.
The Republican candidate Donald Trump held a controversial campaign.

Britain must direct the Olympic spirit into the right direction and expand the Hithrow.
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our present settlements and in general throughout London, but throughout the country.
As I think, it was exactly the huge advantage of HITROU, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to make our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms near Hitrau.
Only for our settlements we will create 10,000 new stages, 40,000 new jobs and end the youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think the task of expanding Hithrow is too large.
I was told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympics, and that we will find ourselves in a difficult situation on the world arena.
The skeptics made a mistake in 2012 and will prove them wrong about Hithrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow responds to any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which implemented the 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment program in time and within the budget, from T5 – the best terminal of the airport for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world’s two most occupied runs.
Now they are ready to provide a third landing line, confirmed by £16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to direct the Olympic Spirit into the right direction and to expand the Hithrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dighton, Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Treasury Trade Attache
Adblock Plus, Facebook Play in "Mice Cats" on the Problem of Blocking Ads
For companies that make money on internet advertising, attempts to overcome the software to block advertising are a game in "cats-mice", according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a few days after Facebook announced it was going to block the advertising blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site is changing the line around its advertising, making it more difficult for advertisers to recognize which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that it was able to overcome the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the community of open source advertising blockers and those who are trying to overcome it continues since the invention of advertising blocking,” and it is possible that Facebook will present its own decision soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the struggle is a clear sign of how big a problem the advertising blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use advertising blockers, according to the past year’s Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of people who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users coming to Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
However, the company is hunting for advertising blockers on the desktop version, as mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in Facebook’s mobile apps for social network and Instagram, the spokesman said.
However, advertising in the desktop version is a fairly profitable article that Facebook can consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced it is going to update its “reklam preferences” tool to give people more control over how advertising is targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters are concerned as they will also block some non-reklamed content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an official email.
Adblocker is a brutal tool, so instead we’ve focused on creating tools such as Ad Preferences to transfer management to people’s hands.
A woman moved on a Swiss highway in an episode of obvious suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was moved by several vehicles on the highway early on Thursday morning in an obvious attempt to commit suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morj in the V canton immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, the police said in a statement.
Obviously trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died in place.
A few involved drivers have already been interrogated, but the identity of some has not yet been established, the police said, calling them and someone else who was a witness to the incident, to respond.
A criminal case has been initiated, a “logical” step in such a situation, said lawyer Gile Hofster, Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is still to be clear if any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the attack?
That’s what the prosecutor must determine,” Hofteter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years allow to assume that drivers will not be recognized as responsible.
In each case - both of which involve a person walking in the dark on the road - a sentence was issued that the drivers cannot expect a random encounter with the pedestrian on the road in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was justified for causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Pyearn in the night of August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim was drunk and lost consciousness on the road, hearing the court.
The court found that a police woman — who responded to an emergency call — was driving the vehicle in a way that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morj must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to NASA’s new climate model.
Scientists from the Nazi Goddard Institute of Space Studies have developed a model for the study of the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, with its hot waterless surface and atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide, there could ever be conditions similar to the Earth.
Scientists previously suggested that the small speed of Venus' rotation is explained by its density of atmosphere.
But the latest modeling makes it possible to assume that Venus could probably have a cut atmosphere like the Earth, and it still rotates slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet is likely to have more drought regions than the Earth, but once it had enough water and geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus was also beneficial to the sun, which was 30 percent softer.
“According to the GISS model, the slow rotating of Venus puts its daily side to the sun for almost two months once,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Henius said in a press release.
It warms the planet’s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, acting as a sunlight, protecting the planet’s surface from a substantial portion of solar heat.
The result is the average climate temperatures, which, as surprisingly, is a few degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that was previously predicted by planets researchers.
Despite the fact that once Venus was possibly habitable, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans were evaporated and her water pair was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flew, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect – that is, the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves Avalanche's coach
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey activity on Thursday, referring to a lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
Executive Vice President/CEO of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have performed my duties as chief coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey activity with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
Over the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level.
To this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must perfectly match the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right of vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at the moment.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of play-offs and lost play-offs in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the struggle for the second preference to participate in the Western Conference.
Gartner from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups – two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil companies resume negotiations and stop strike
The work strike on the issue of the wages of the oil producers in the North Sea has been suspended, and all the parties of the discussion are beginning to a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties said.
The attacks against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on the North Sea platforms led by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the unions of Unite and RMT can confirm that we agreed to renew the process of negotiations to resolve current disputes,” the joint statement said.
We will hold several full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of the next week, to look at the problems with a fresh look.
The trade unions that their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wages cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contractual employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market tensions.
The company’s interest rates dropped after a 10-percent reduction in the interest rates for contractual employees working on the coast in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space needed to overcome the decline of the market.
Shell, on its side, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas operations in countries up to 10, as it rationalizes its operations due to its mega alliance with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the falling prices of unclean oil: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union adopted by the UK in June.
Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our time.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need a economy that would work for the majority, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the rotating of the stars in the Playoffs
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of the rotating speeds of the stars belonging to the Playout.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate at different speeds and how the rotation periods are related to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star collections, we will learn more about the interconnection between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Louise Riball, a scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Playout is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the gathering now only reach maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They turn as quickly as they will never be again.
At their peak rotating speeds, these adult stars throw out large amounts of star wind.
Travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds have a braking effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star, tracing the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sun spots.
The latest rotating speed catalog suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Fishermen compare the stars to the dancers: the larger make the pirates slower than the smaller.
“In the Pleiad ballet, we see that those that turn slowly are usually more massive, while those that turn faster are usually very light stars,” Riball said.
Since the Playout is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars with the rotation speeds.
“The Pleiada Star Assembly provides a starting point for the theoretical patterns of star rotation, both younger and older,” Riball said.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where and why the stars slow down their rotation and hang their "dancing shoes" on the hole.
Ryball and colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Playout rotation speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation, linked to the activity of a group of Ukrainian dissent detained in Crimea, is conducted by two departments, writes "Kommersant".
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of the detainees in the preparation of the diversions in Crimea.
As previously, gratitude testimony was given by the resident of the Ukrainian city Energodar Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for diversions he considered the Titan chemistry plant in Armenia, the oil base in Theodosius, the Kerch ferry pipeline, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airports.
The law enforcement officials believe that it was not possible to detain all divisors.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The main coach of the Russian football team was Stanislav Cherchesov.
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union was adopted a decision on the appointment to the post of the head coach of the Russian football team, Stanislav Cherchesov.
The contract with him will be scheduled for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the executive of the Russian Federation appointed the head coach of the Russian football team, Stanislav Cherchesov.
This is a famous footballer who previously played in the Moscow "Spartak" on the positions of the goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of such Russian teams as all the same "Spartak", "Jemchugina-Socci", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dinamo", as well as the Warsaw "Legion", which became the winner of the national championship and the country's cup.
It is that the contract with Chersov will be signed as soon as possible and is scheduled for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare the team for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that his coach headquarters will be Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information that the total salary of the coach will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation has set the goal before Stanislav Chershev to bring the Russian team to the semi-finals and to win medals.
As the coach himself said, as a primary task he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and intends to give the footballers the opportunity to demonstrate themselves.
Also, according to Chershev, he was glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Chershev will be held on August 31 in Antalya - this will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall, earlier the post of the main coach of the Russian football team was occupied by Leonid Слуцкий, who combined him with the coach in the club CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the Russian national team's failed performance at the Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad result of the team on himself.
Compressed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia was severely affected during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after independence from South Africa in 1990, this country with a population of 2.4 million people has achieved huge successes, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia’s success is that the government is paying a lot of attention to education.
While people in developed countries perceive as free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require a fee for education.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce training fees to “refund costs”.
However, in Namibia education in primary schools is free.
Secondary education has been free since 2015.
The authorities of the country are also actively working on other important areas.
The efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of the disease by 97% over the last ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of growing inequality, it is decreasing in Namibia.
Compared to the 1993 indicator, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard indicator of inequality in income distribution, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate dropped from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) also decreased, from 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest freedom rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is significantly ahead of the United States and other wealthy countries.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perception Index", which is made up by human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that raw materials prices fall, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt ratio to GDP is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the U.S. and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment level, at least by traditional assessment methods, remains quite high – almost 28%.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high HIV/AIDS rate – 17% of the population is infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is one of the countries with income above the average, but the authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia, of course, faces some difficulties that are characteristic of poorly developed economies.
The state has to develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts live isolated cattle tribes of hunting-collectors, who in any way must be integrated into the modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people that a quarter of a century ago were on the periphery of the world economy is not an easy task for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it is facing the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia has not thought of leaving its hands, the country is solving the problems that are facing it.
Almost immediately after the independence, the authorities engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a joint society.
It is remarkable that the competing political factions gathered together to work for the common good.
In fact, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of the visitors to medical facilities in the northern districts of Namibia are Angola citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from the poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibia people understood that the neighbors don’t choose, and therefore they decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate – to share the water resources that lack, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investments and exchange students.
In addition, the government of Namibia justified that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of few by the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the revenue from the natural resources of Namibia needs to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to pursue the maximum profit from the country’s sales of resources, and review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that it is so.
Transparency is crucial for this process, so strong support by the government for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of state Hague Geingob noted, the media often say something he doesn’t like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the gained freedoms, the president says.
Not all the key resources of Namibia are exhausted.
Some - such as fishing - are considered to be renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious disadvantages – racism, colonial order, inequality and low levels of development – can stand on the path to general prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Golden Barna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 years before our era).
Per this was the strongest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropole, a fantastic number of gold artefacts was found - more than three thousand total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only from one cemetery, known as the "Majila No. 43", 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were extracted.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon pass to the invisible bull found by archaeologists in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tel Yunacet.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tel Yunaciate is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunaciate in the Pazarjik district.
The busin is a golden strip swallowed into the ring.
Yavour Boyajiev, the head of the excavations in Telle Junacet, dated the discovery 4600 years before our era and said it was older than the gold of Varna for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, let’s remember, date about the same period, 4600-4200 BC.
Technologies that allow perfect accuracy to date the metal do not exist.
How do you know which gold is more ancient?
Obviously, Professor Boyajiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am completely confident that the Yunaciti gold is older than the Varna gold."
It’s a finding of extraordinary importance: it looks like it’s a small object, but it’s large enough to occupy a suitable place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Boyajiev said that in the near future scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re- and more thoroughly explore the archaeological layer where the gold artefacts were found.
This will help to date the busin with the most accuracy possible.
The location also explains a lot.
Tel Yunaciets is a famous settlement, even if you’ve never heard of it.
Today, Tel Aviv is considered the oldest “city” in Europe.
Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Thro the subsequent centuries, the processing of metals was rapidly developed in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the domestic historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpatic metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC around the metal processing centers began to arise urban-type settlements.
Now they are called the oldest cities in Europe.
These are the most ancient of the Tel Yunacite, since the artifacts were found here from the year 4900 BC.
I would call the Tel Yunaciti a prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand years older than Shumer," Boyajiev says, having regard to the commonly accepted opinion that the urban culture was born in the south of Mesopotamia - the modern Iraq.
There emerged the first cities in the usual sense of this word.
The excavation of the Yunaciti body has been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists excavated 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
From houses and workshops little has been preserved, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban density, "business center" and residential areas.
Tel Yunacians are often referred to as the "bird city": there were found dozens of glinated bird figures.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, from which the assumption arose that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local cult.
The bird city was destroyed about 4100 years before our era – possibly by the Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
There were no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
The three-meter fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists discovered obvious signs of a brutal battle: inside the houses were found remains of elderly, women and children with traces of wounds caused by the battle towers.
New findings and new facts appear every year, changing usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, born on the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the “Golden War” found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the golden luxury of Varna had to have something to prevail – something like a tiny golden shell created in Telle Junacet.
Porsche introduces 911 Targa
Officially, the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by the specialists of the unit, who work with serial machines.
"Retro-luck" consists, for example, in the special colour of the etna blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B - in this colour painted even the logo of the model.
In addition, the fair received a firm white graph along the boats and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel disks, as well as some curve design details painted in "white-gold metal".
In the interior of the retro cartridges is noticeably smaller: it distinguishes, in large scale, the gray-blue design range, new chairs with extended range of electrical regulations and separated black anodized steel thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when purchasing a special version, each buyer will receive a bag for the car and a richly separated album with photos of the production process.
The power installation of the specialists of Porsche Exclusive has not been touched: the retro-targa according to the characteristics is quite consistent with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a 3.0 l turbo drive volume, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can speed up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released with a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each specific sports car are.
Facebook and advertising blockers unleashed “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook technology that prevented the hiding of advertising on social media pages has provoked developers to block advertising for responsive actions.
AdBlock Plus has released a “anti-feed”, but Facebook plans to soon make it useless.
So AdBlock Plus announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Representatives of the social network noted that, seeking to cheat the new technology of “non-blocked” advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus along with commercial ads blocks and many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed regret for this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to resolve the problem soon.
As a source among social network developers told TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop site will be ready in the coming hours.
Thus, the social network and the blockers disconnected a kind of "race of weapons", trying to overtake each other, the affected side became users who missed interesting records from friends or saw advertising where they were not used to see it.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have recently caused hot disputes.
In Murmansk, the violent will appear before the court · Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murman region.
The alleged accusation of a 54-year-old man is very serious – committing violent acts of sexual nature.
The investigation found that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of the Pavlov Street in Murmansk committed acts of sexual nature with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for the maximum penalty in the form of imprisonment for a period of up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia the Fengguang 370 crossover and the Rich New pickup - www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of China’s popularity-growing car class, combining the advantages of the minivan and crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the pickup Rich New.
Many Western firms have decided to ignore the Moscow International Auto Show this year, so the emptiness of the “Crocus Expo” exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large views on the Russian market and intends to offer our car lovers a number of interesting news in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover, which came into sale in China this spring at a price of 55 900 yuan (less than 550 thousand rubles).
For the Russians, such a value is unlikely to shine, and the issue of supplies to our country is still in the phase of discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 according to the results of June sales managed to reach the 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivens, although due to its large road light (175 mm) and the protective plastic coating on the lower perimeter of the body it can quite be classified as crossovers.
Crossen is built on the front drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370s have the same wheel base in 2725 mm, but the curves are slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden plates, but the large vertical sensor screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossover, and the cars with "music" were sold easier.
Five of the seven landing places are easily arranged, forming a flat load site of 1650 mm length, the maximum baggage volume is 1500 l.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - 1.5-litre gasoline "atmospheric" with a power of 115 hp, coated with a 5-step mechanical transmission box.
About the dynamic qualities of the machine the manufacturer modestly silence, but promises the saving budget of the owner appetite at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is well known to the Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a slightly rewarded Chinese stylists design.
Despite the morally obsolete design, this model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unacceptable "working horse".
With a similar price, Rich New will be interested in the Russians, because modern Japanese picapes have become unparalleled expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: 2.4 l (137 hp) gasoline or 2.5 l (116 hp) turbodiesel.
The transmission box - only mechanics, drive - to the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a hardly connected "front".
It will be on the stand of Dongfeng and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premier representation of the Chinese firm announced in June.
Minven-like crossovers on the Chinese market are becoming more and more, some of the latest news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian line of Dongfeng consists of two models: the sedan S30 and the hatchback H30 Cross.
During the seven months of this year, the dealer of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications on transport tax will cease to be sent by mail - www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the procedure for sending notifications on property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the unchanged scheme for years: in the summer and autumn they receive by mail a ticket to pay the transport tax for the previous year.
However, many of them will not be expected this year.
The fact is that tax inspection without excessive noise has changed the procedure for informing citizens.
Those registered in the "Personal Office of the taxpayer" on the official website of the agency nalog.ru, notifications will come in electronic form.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically identified as online users and pulled them out of the standard, “paper” mail.
The news will affect all vehicle and real estate owners.
The rest will still receive usual letters.
However, the possibility to return to the old scheme is also available to the owners of the account on the site.
For this, they will have to visit the tax department during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after preparation, while the letter will last for a few days and may be completely lost.
Additionally, the number of users of the internet service of tax inspection exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on the mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the website of the inspection is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed procedure.
Some could register in the "personal office" to get one-time service and for a long time forgot about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the "Personal Office of the taxpayer" is made in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, using an electronic signature or entering the login and password indicated in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally at any tax inspection department ( regardless of the place of registration).
The tax must be paid by 1 December this year.
The notification began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which the upgrades are aimed at achieving a very high yield, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not disturb the masters of the company G-Power, who took over the modification of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is strange to its masters.
In fact, why not improve the G 63 - 571-power flying squad with a aerodynamic tank and a set up to a hundred in 5.4 s?
By climbing the "muscles" of the crazy "helic", the master took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-litre overwhelming "eight" opens.
But the dynamic stretch up to a hundred has improved by undifferentiable 0.1 s, and now the flying "carp" is capable of riding for 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from average speeds are probably given him significantly better.
The speed ceiling is scary: if the standard G 63 does not drive 210 km/h faster, then the tuning road with the deactivated electronic "hole" is able to stretch 250 km/h.
Externally, the car is practically inseparable from its factory primary source, except for other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR with a size of 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury Mercedes-Maybach unit has announced an amazing 6m concept cup that will be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.

In the coming years, there will be at least four environmental news.
