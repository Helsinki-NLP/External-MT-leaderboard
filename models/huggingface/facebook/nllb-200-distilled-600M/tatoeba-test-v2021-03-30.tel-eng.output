Near the station

He made her a bookshelf
When Tom heard this, Mary was upset.
There is no reason to fear.
Today is not over yet
The Bible says that "they will not be ashamed of themselves".
We want to hear
Are you still afraid of anything?
I was so hurt.
I should have done it all myself.
The nearest bus stop is somewhere.
Who did not come?
How much room do you have?

The baby cries for milk
I know you're gonna tell me no.
These pencils are the same color.
I'll be very careful

That is a foolish question.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Which color do you like , blue or purple ?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
She was sitting at the table.
We were so crazy about tennis.

What were you talking about?
Are you all right?
Oh, my God!
Stay where you are.
Do you live around here?
What are you doing tomorrow, Tom?

Oh, my God!
This sock is not washed.
She's not a doctor.
Why haven't you slept yet?

You're coming so soon.
Cabbages are delicious.
We should take that opportunity.
Bring me some tea.
How much is the book worth?
Come on, I'll give you some too.

What a surprise!
The cat was frightened by the fog .
The film is about to begin.
Is that true?

You can do it
People believe in God.
I made a mistake, even if I didn't want to.
I am learning Burmese.

Ram came to the bath.
Did the Lata come?
I make mistakes too.

Tom was very scared.
Did you do your homework?
My head hurts
Where words cannot speak, there music speaks.
Is the work done?
Amy, is this real?
How long has it been?
I don't know who won.
Out of sight, out of mind.
I don't think it's going to work.
I'll get off at the next stop.
Is it really that bad?
I'm not allowed to do that here.
What time is it now?
How's the house?
I started talking.
Mary bought a bare-knuckle handbag.
He's on his way to school.
My husband is coming to dinner.
You're not the only one to blame.
Do you know why he's so angry?
It seems very interesting.
Is it Chinese or Japanese?
It is better to leave yourself alone
The help came too late
That's right.
You need not be ashamed.
Go on over there.
What are you saying?
Is my work done?
Don't get in the way of my work.
Two blows for one blow
It's a reading.
Is there anything else to say?
Wrong
She was breathing cold air.
It is very valuable.

What else would I miss?
Are you mad?
You'll understand when you're my father.
A good doctor is not only a great caveman but also a great physician.
Tell me about your daily life
You can go swimming or fishing.
My computer is expensive.

He earns three times as much as I do.
I never saw him.
Are you willing to do this?
Are you all right?
How are you?
Go there tomorrow!
I usually do it.
Did Lata come from school?
Why can't giraffes sing?
How peaceful this tent is!
I know he's coming.
It's not my fault.
The work is almost done.
I heard you're not feeling well.
Why did you lie to her?
It's not that easy.
You're a little fat.

Brush your teeth regularly
When did you quit smoking?
The hands and legs of the steam are long

Who are we ?
I heard the bell ringing.
Can I make a phone call?

Only animal ingredients contain fat.
Please give me another cup of coffee.
My advice is that you do it.

Shabash, you put this toy right!
I drank coffee.
How are you?
