Spectacular Wingsuit Jump over Bogota
Athletic athlete Jnathan Florez jumped from a helicopter above Bogota, the capital of Colombia on Thursday.
While wearing a wingsuit, he flew past the famous Monserrate Sanctuary at 160km/h.
Black box in your car?
As America’s road planners struggle to find the money to repair a broken highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that goes neatly by the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.
The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly become intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of your miles and possibly where you drive them.
The tea party is abuzzing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is very concerned with a range of privacy issues.
While Congress cannot agree on whether to proceed, several States are not waiting.
The authors are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system where drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.
The black boxes have been tested by thousands of motorists, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is a must for our country.
Tracking is not something we might choose to do, Ikhrata said.
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is there to do it.
The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.
Americans do not buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars get many more miles to the gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not changed in 20 years.
Politicians are lazy to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.
The gas tax is just not sustainable, according to Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
The state recently placed tracking devices on 500 cars to test a pay-by-mile system.
The most logical alternative is a long term alternative, he said.
Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.
The idea is no surprise that the taxes could be adjusted to change driving patterns in ways that could reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.
Planning experts are looking at the system as they develop strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
The chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), has also called it the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.
This is not just a tax going into a black hole, said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People are paying more directly into what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report called for Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involvement of about 10,000 cars.
The House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often require logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.
Some states and cities are still moving ahead on their own.
The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's most significant experiment.
The drivers will soon pay mileage fees to the state instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot.
New York City is looking for one.
Illinois is trying it on limited basis with trucks.
The I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania and Florida), is studying how they can implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were equipped with the devices, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.
Fears about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem, according to Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It was not something people wanted.
As the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned that "these devices could be quite easy to convert into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will always expand to keep records of individuals' daily comings and goings.
Nevada is among several states now seeking affordable technology that could allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is driving, but not exactly where and at what time.
If you can do that, Khan added, the public gets more comfortable.
The search for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of helping state tax drivers.
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
The devices it is testing are useful to highway planners because they do not use GPS and provide limited information, uploaded periodically by modem.
They will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are many less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with different choices for drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Then they can choose not to have a device at all, instead taking a flat fee based on the average mileage driven by all state residents.
Other places are trying to sell the concept to a sceptic public by having the devices do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxing device that could also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic.
Drivers would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it provides to them.
Some transportation planners wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress can very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.
The levy may be added on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles do not use much gas, so they can earn their fair share.
Nothing is radical surgery when you only need to take an aspirin.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Songs Released
The British musician is full of surprises this year.
Next Day, released in January, has a deluxe re-release planned for November 04, featuring several unpublished tracks.
Four have already appeared on the Internet.
The announcement that David Bowie was releasing a new album had shocked the world.
On 08 January 2013, the date of his 66th birthday, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (his last record, Reality, was released in 2003), the British musician proved that he still could light up the pop scene.
A gathering for fans
The Next Day was a few surprises for David Bowie:
Thin White Duke was also planning to re-release the album on November 04.
The celebration was a real celebration for his fans.
The re-release, titled The Next Day Extra, was presented in three CDs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, plus a DVD with the four clips that have already been unveiled.
Next Day Extra had totally ten additional tracks compared to the original album: three songs from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, and two remixes.
Moreover, David Bowie has introduced this fine box-set through a video.
In it, he presents each of the disks with the accessories supplied with them: exclusive photos and sleeves, a notebook for sharing your own impressions, a lyrics booklet etc.
Then he gives a teaser for his new track, Atomica, which is typically in the style of The Next Day, with very prominent guitars and skillfully controlled rock electrics.
Previously Unpublished Tracks Released
Atomica is not the only track to have been released.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man and Born In A UFO are also available on the net.
The Informer is double-edged - an unsettling intro followed by a brilliant rush of sound that gradually slows to make way for a pop ballad.
How was Bowie trying to make a reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity in his Like A Rocket Man?
However, with this cheerful track, the singer seems to be in his element when his feet are no longer on the ground.
Space Oddity was much more serious.
On Born in a UFO, David Bowie once again referred to his strangeness: could he have come from another planet?
The spellbinding guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth.
However, Bowie does like to play the chameleon in these tracks: in turn, an informer, a rocket man, possibly a Martian...
The devil is a versatile person, and likes to take on different personalities as he has throughout his career, most notably with his persons: Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is therefore not surprising that he should be wearing a mask in the promotional photography for the new invitation to travel, by Louis Vuitton.
The man is seen in one of their adverts, broadcast from November 10.
The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, stressed that injured soldiers are not summarised discharged from the Canadian Armed Forces and stressed that all soldiers undergo a transition process before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson ensured that prior to their discharge, army members underwent a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All injured soldiers receive the appropriate care in preparedness for their return to civilian life and no one has been discharged before being ready.
The detractors are accusing the government of trying to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the army's universality of service, which requires that personnel perform a series of varying tasks - to reach the ten-year period of admissibility for retirement benefits.
The authors have specifically noted two cases reported in The Canada Press, one involving a soldier discharged last Friday.
Lance Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and discharged from the army, despite asking for a full-indexed pension.
The case follows that of Lance Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he was forced to leave before he was ready to serve.
However, Mr Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared for his departure, with planning and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the army.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.
Since several months I asked if there was a way I could stay on, and they said no.
Since the start of major combat in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to define what latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to stay in the army but are not capable of combat.
The current rules allow serious injured soldiers to recover in three years.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployment, they can be forced to leave the army.
The data presented to the parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers discharged for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
The liberal spokesman for former service personnel, Jim Karygiannis, asked for Lance Corporal Hawkins to be reinstated, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris asked for an immediate end to "this shameful practice".
Disney to Launch New Animated Series on Tablet PCs
Disneyland has decided to give priority to tablet PCs over its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available on November 24 on the site watchdisneyjunior.com or via its application for mobile phones and tablets.
The global launch on Disney Group channels is not planned until 2014, according to a press release from its Disney Junior division.
The animation, aimed at children aged 2–7, is about the adventures of Callie, the sheriff of a town in the Wild West where she keeps law and order with a magic lasso.
Every episode is two 11-minute stories.
Smartphones and tablets are second nature for children today, says Albert Cheng, vice-president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend its series and build new relationships with audiences via digital platforms that are becoming ever more important," he added.
The survey published by Common Sense Media on the beginning of the week shows an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the USA: 38% of children under 2 have a tablet or mobile phone, and 72% of under 8s.
Snowden ready to cooperate with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he will travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.
MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss his testing in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Although my efforts have been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do this.
Relation between the US and Germany has been strained after claims that the NSA bugged Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said if there was an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness without bringing him into danger and completely ruining US relations, it should be taken.
Mr Ströbele, a member of the Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.
The visit was accompanied by two German journalists.
Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not return to Russia if he left.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he is "safe" there, the MP said.
Snowden told the letter that he was faced with a "severe and sustained campaign of persecution that forced him to his home.
However he added that he was very happy with the global response to his act of political expression.
Citizens worldwide as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be public service.
The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Cogeco Cable Soon to Offer Interactive TV?
Cogeco Cable subscribers may soon have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and, ultimately, Netflix video-on-demand service.
The Cogeco subsidiary announced Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
The initiative will allow us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and larger number of options.
Cogeco Cable is thus following the path of its competitors, such as Bell.
"We need adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet stressed.
The goal is still to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The telecom giant Rogers has already announced that it might offer Netflix if technical details (which it did not cite) were resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service is reported to be discussing the possibility of making its service available via their broadcasting platforms with some major cable companies.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in his Throne speech on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the option of accessing the services on a pay-per-view basis.
Consumers have been saying for about two and half years that the idea of forcing consumers to purchase major packages of channels is not working.
However, he believes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
The discussions need to produce a new type of reference framework for the definition of the new cultural policy in Canada relating to television, according to Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week, and these will continue with the industry next spring.
In terms of results, Cogeco has reported a net profit of CAD 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, representing 82¢ per share.
This is a drop compared to the net profit of CAD 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, recorded in the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company says this drop is due to depreciation expenses relating to recent acquisitions.
In 2012 Cogeco acquired US-based cable distributor Atlantic Broadband for CAD 1,360 million.
This was the first major acquisition after its failed aquisition attempt in Portugal.
The Montreal company also acquired Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a network based in Vancouver for $526 million last December.
In terms of revenue, Cogeco saw a 4.1% increase in the fourth quarter, reaching CAD 504.7 million.
It has a revenue of CAD 1,800 million for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was CAD 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, compared to CAD 45.7 million or 93¢ per share last year.
However, Cogeco Cable saw a 45% growth, reaching CAD 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
Even so, the number of Cogeco Cable customers rose by 5,546 for the 2013 fiscal year.
Audet is not concerned by this fluctuation in the number of customers.
However, for me, this is not a change in trend.
"It varies from one quarter to the next in a very lively competition."
Horse in Beef Products
Horse meat has been detected in beef-based canned food products sold by two small British low-cost distribution retailers, the Food Standards Agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that products produced in Romania in January and sold by shops of the Home Bargain and Quality Save chains contained between 1 and 5% horse DNA.
Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product, according to the British agency.
The spread of horse meat in prepared meals started in Europe in the beginning of the year, after tests carried out in Ireland.
The most affected by this meat is France, which is the most affected by the presence of this meat in products which are supposed to contain only beef.
Two vehicles collide on Route 131 in Lanaudière leaving four injured Friday morning.
After 4am, a driver heading north towards Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and struck another car travelling in the opposite direction.
The four passengers of the two vehicles were ill, but not lethally.
Traffic returns to normal at around 6am.
Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, but its announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will get to keep the whole can.
The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.
"We do not want to charge that," she added.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stacked in overhead bins, meaning that bins often run out of space.
Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.
O Malley said the new charge is not about raising money.
It is about Frontier’s most loyal customers making clear that overhead bin space is increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
The Frontier gate might allow one person to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee will start in summer, but no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.
The argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.
Many on the street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have not touched carry-on bags fees, though.
Spirit Airlines Inc started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, which is a carrier with a fixed fee.
The December 2011 report estimates that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.
Passengers asked Sorensen what he would find at the gate when he encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.
The boarding process was the smoothest I have seen in my career," he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, and it boarded lickety-split.
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, or juice.
Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.
Still give water.
US Airways briefly tried charging for drinks in 2008 but changed course seven months later after passengers complained and no major airline followed.
Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is its latest effort to drive customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
The initiative has given all airlines an incentive to directly buy from them, instead of going through an online travel agent.
Frontier has gone the farest in this area.
In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agent.
On Wednesday it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of the trip.
The Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agent would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
Revenue declined 9 percent and its flight capacity shed nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.
NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that caused the website to freeze for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update.
The issue will be resolved this evening.
The outage was caused by a distributed denied service [DDoS] attack.
Early this evening online server trackers reported the NSA website was down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.
Early on an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was not at all compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
The NSA website was reportedly downed by a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactic is relatively unsophisticated and the attacks are not aimed at penetrating the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in public light, and amid severe criticism, in recent months after a stream of revelations about its vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta City Closed
Delta Centre Ville Hotel in Montreal closed its doors on Thursday after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will convert it into student residences.
The hotel had three hundred and fifty employees.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta has promised not to abandon its employees.
Employers have come to meet employees on site and have individually assessed their needs.
The support will continue for the next six months, explains the regional labour relations director at Delta hotels, Felix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta occurs at a time of great competition in the hotel market.
The investment fund that owned the building had to make a choice.
The building would have to be re-invested in it to continue using it, which would require investments of tens of millions of dollars while competition is fierce as many new hotels have appeared in Montreal.
explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Chair in Tourism at the School of Management at the UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will be a home for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will be implemented in the next two years.
"Plan to buy Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees," Titan CEO says
After dramaticly turning down in January over the partial takeover of Goodyear in Amiens North, which is due to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of American tire manufacturer, Titan, now says he is ready to save 333 of the factory's 1,137 workers.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Industrial Recovery, had already announced this on Monday October 21.
After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January, today you are back.
You had a very aggressive attack and insult, talking about 'so-called workers' who work three hours a day, and 'mad' unions, targeting the CGT.
It is hard to understand this U-turn.
Is this a request to please Mr. Montebourg?
I am not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.
I am sorry if my words have offended anyone.
There are high levels of tax and unemployment in France too.
Does the truth offend you?
Working seven hours a day when people in other countries work eight hours is holding France back.
In India, China and many other countries people work ten to twelve hours a day.
I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory which produces good agricultural tires, has good equipment, good location and plenty of room for growth.
Why do Titan need this factory so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
If the price is right and the workers are qualified, it's worth trying.
What sort of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear offered the employees a good severance package after announcing the factory was closing, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, imagine that Titan acquires a closed factory from Goodyear.
Titan could choose to move the machinery to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the factory in Amiens with at least 333 well paid workers.
Titan has agreed to recruit them from the 1,200 or so people currently working for Goodyear.
Also, Mr Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to meet with Goodyear.
First step is to sign an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
Then there will be no workers left in the factory.
Mr Montebourg has said that you are prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
How can you confirm?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
However, as I said you, the CGT and Goodyear must first reach an agreement on severance pay.
If all employees accept it, the project of acquiring Goodyear Amiens will start with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees on the length of employment when no employees are left on site?
If Mr Montebourg gets the CGT and Goodyear to reach an agreement and Titan acquires the factory, we have every intention of staying in Amiens North for more than four years.
Bombardier profits dip as flight delivery, orders fall
Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday, driven by fewer orders and delivery in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.
Bombardier also declined to release any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or offer any update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of coming into commercial service in September.
After the first flight about a month and half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions about whether the test phase is on track.
Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday, given the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.
While the weaker aircraft deliveries were most expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation.
Bombardier is expecting new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
If no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can climb into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and took off for the first time in September after months of delays.
The firm orders for the CSeries are modest at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight tests to verify the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost saving potential.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Bombardier Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is deployed into commercial use.
Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to schedule.
The test plane remained on the ground for a short time, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the duration of the downtime.
Every manufacturer schedules it differently.
The first flight and the update period have been done.
It will happen all through the flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remaining following shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry into service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
However, this slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that entry into service will be pushed to Q1/15.
Bombardier's net profit falls to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue slipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft from 83 aircraft.
The backlog in aerospace division was $32.9 billion as September 30, unchanged from December 31.
However, low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing.
Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.
The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in several large contracts.
Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday.
Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's close rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
The two missing workers were found in a cave under the Dent de Crolles on Thursday evening, according to a report from the Isère cave rescue organization on Friday.
The suspects were found on Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced and the other not, set off underground on Thursday at around 9.30pm in an attempt to cross the Crolles Dent, which is in the district of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
There was no news after this, according to the same source.
The potholders were due to return around 5am, according to Thierry Larribe, technical consultant at the cave-rescue organization.
Dozens of people on site
Twenty or so rescuers, ten civilians from the French cave-rescue organization, as well police, mountain rescue services and firefighters were present.
The two potholders were found late Friday afternoon.
The other group of potholders found them in the hole exhausted but in good health and sent them to one of the rescue teams working in the network of tunnels.
The two men, who are soldiers in the 13th Battalion of French Alpine Troops stationed in Chambéry, were found "exhausted but uninjured".
The two went lost in the network but re-traced their steps while waiting for assistance, the police said.
After being given supplies, they are expected to exit the cave in the evening with the help of the rescuers.
German Journalists Urged to Shun Google and Yahoo
The Union of German journalists asked its members to stop using Google and Yahoo online services on Thursday, after new revelations about the activities of American and British Intelligence Services.

Repainted Traffic Lights: MP Asks Brigitte Grouwels to Resign
Everyone is pleased with Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to give traffic light posts in Brussels a facelift.
The Minister of Public Works and Transport in Brussels launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday, consisting of repainting 16 traffic light posts in yellow and blue colours of the Brussels region.
The aim of this is to both increase safety and "enhance the identity of Brussels".
The idea is to eventually repaint all the traffic lights in Brussels, at an estimated cost of one million Euros.
The blue chosen by the Minister is too dark, according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who talks about the "Flemishing" of the capital and is demanding the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels.
'Not content with spending water on this scheme of giving traffic light posts a facelift with the colours of the Brussels region, Brigitte Grouwels is continuing her efforts to turn Brussels into a Flemish city', says De Bock in a press release.
After her mango yellow and black taxis, she has ended up repainting the posts in Brussels yellow, dark blue and black.
The MP says there is no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
The residents of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a Christian Democratic and Flemish Minister, who is carrying out the New Flemish Alliance program herself.
It is high time the Flemish Trojan Horse was stopped.
Remember, Brigitte Grouwels was elected by 2,245 votes, that is 0.5% of Brussels inhabitants!" De Bock says.
Buis Portico Dismantled
The ecotax portico in Pont de Buis, around which a violent demonstration against the tax took place on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site at 10am, and traffic on the main road was diverted afterwards.
The decision to take the portico down was taken by Ecomouv, the company holding the portico.
This was the last of three ecotax porticos still operating in the Finistère department, the other two having been taken down or sabotaged.
Glass Accessories Shop Launched
The online shop offering a range of accessories for Google Glass has just been launched for the thousands of developers who own a prototype of the Google-branded, web-enabled glasses.
It means they can now get headphones, charger or even a storage case.
The shop, strictly reserved for developers who have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and USB cable for $50.
It is also possible to get a micro-fiber protective cover or in-ear headphones for the same price.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass with corrective lenses, no date for full scale launch has yet been announced.
Five years ago my father died.
Then I spoke of him in the present tense.
I was afraid of forgetting him, or maybe I was not aware of how I would continue to "spend time with him".
There is no formula, no method for passing through the wall of the invisible to be with your loved ones.
Then signs started to appear.
The first time I had this very strong feeling of his presence, he was in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time is when I quietly woke up in the middle of the night and looked at his watch, which I always have with me, lying on the bedside table.
The smiling image of my father remains with me during my daily activities.
Our mother left us after an exhausting fight against cancer.
The shell of her stiff body was what I thought when I saw the shell of her stiff body under the crumpled sheet of the hospital bed.
Similarly, her funeral was a cold funeral focused on the dim light of the candles around her coffin.
I thought she had gone.
Soon, by way of tiny and slightly faint or faded appearances during day and night, she gradually took her place in my life, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my mind which thought it was still in mourning.
Then she revealed herself by showing me aspects of myself I never saw before, that were hidden by my relationship with her.
Then I learned and understood that I have not lost my mother, but a woman I do not know well, a woman who created her during her stay on this earth.
In death, this woman completed her life and freed the person I loved, and now she was back, whole and complete.
This journey in my life is still the most unexpected and beautiful thing.
It is a privilege to know that we love our people never leave us.
I am like my father, "inside and out" it seems.
I have always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationship with him until he became old and ill.
At that point I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time he stayed with me - when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was ill...
The nurse would speak to me, constantly encourage me, and he lived in my body.
I could see his hands when I look at mine; I lent him my body.
This was never indiscrete.
I could still lead a personal life.
He allowed me my privacy.
Then he went away.
In the end, it felt comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I do not know who it was that said that those who die are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer here but I feel them close to me constantly.
In every event, every moment of my life I feel their presence, and I am always asking them: What would they say, what would they think, what would they do?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week for sure.
I often dream of the last moments I shared with them before it was too late, but there is still one thing that prevents me from enjoying the moment.
I often wake up distressed because it hits me and I feel their absence deeply.
Some dreams affect me differently and make a different impression on my mind, so they become part of my life.
The day before my ultrasound, when I was going to find out the gender of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up and took my stroller out of bed and my father was waiting for me on the landing.
The next day I believed that he had come to visit me in my dream to tell me that he was sharing the joy I was feeling.
And yes, I was indeed carrying a boy.
I loved sharing that moment with him and enjoy talking about that shared memory that happened after his death.
The exact five years ago my grandmother died of cancer.
One year previously, she travelled with my family to Cuba.
The shock that she caused in the young graduate I was then.
In spite of everything, I took my last leave quite quickly.
It continues to influence my life, especially when I am in difficult times or when I have to make an important decision.
Arabic learning and developing interest in the Middle East, in hindsight, were not trivial decisions.
However, I often heard her speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Morocco where she lived for decades before coming back to France when it became independent.
The values she instilled in me are still there, and I often wonder what she would want me to do at a given time.
It is the same with my opinions: I try to live up to the generous and correctness of her mind as a fervent believer.
Today I feel her as a daily presence, a loving force, a saving spirit.
I see her eyes resting on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
She died after talking to me on the phone.
Through all the stages of incomprehension, anger, grief, tears that would appear on their own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, at unusual moments.
Time eased the pain.
Now there is only the gap, the silent silence, the need for her to trust me, to reassure me in her gentleness.
Still, she is there, a silent presence, watching me.
Every morning I see her anxious eyes looking at me, I see the dark rings giving her a burden look, the wrinkles around the lips dug by cigarettes, the lines that mark the forehead on days of anxiety.
My mother has taken control of my face, and every morning she looks at me in the mirror.
And every morning I look away.
My wife and mother of three children died of cancer at 43.
We always feel her protecting us, nothing bad will happen to us.
This was her promise on her death bed, so gradually we learn to smile again, and calling her name is no longer a threat.
Then I talk to her at the dead of night when the absence hurts too much, and she appears in my dreams when my spirits are low.
The time has changed, and we have become aware of her role as the conductor, with us trying to stay on the path she had drawn for us.
If somebody truly loved you, their absence cannot tear your heart or your memory.
In a way, the person you love becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to asbestos-related cancer.
I was close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or appreciated.
When I died, I was unable to attend his burial, and three weeks after his death I gave birth to a little boy.
Occasionally my beliefs are different from his, so I am always asking myself if what I am doing conforms to his way of seeing things.
I have even had problems at work because of these convictions.
However, I cannot do otherwise, I lose sleep and constantly ask myself what he would think.
I do not know if I have adopted his way of thinking or if I am simply like him - is it genetic?
Whatever the case, he will always be my reference.
The ego was a bit like an alter ego, we didn't even need to speak.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
Almost 30 years ago, my husband died aged 33.
28 and our son was 6.
The pain has eased, but he is still close to me.
The very often he "turns up" in my dreams, in a very specific way, so vivid that I wake up and feel a little sorrow when I wake up to realize that it was just a dream.
The other night he asked me how I was, I said not good, and he asked me to get up, but in a voice so real that I started to get upset and switched on the bedside lamp and look around.
I still live in the same house and, sometimes, I feel he is watching me; I look around and see he isn't there, but I know it is him and I talk to him.
I feel his presence in every room and it makes me happy.
would not leave this house for anything in the world.
I am 58 and I have always lived alone since losing him.
I am very social and have a job with responsibilities. I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him.
October: Bloodiest Month in Iraq since 2008
October was the bloodiest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Iraq published official figures on Friday: 964 people have died in the month - 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
The publication came on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister met the American President.
Noury al Maliki is seeking aid from the United States.
”We are not asking the world to stand by our side and support us, but we have the right to ask the world to stand by our side and support us because we are part of it,” added Al-Maliki in Washington this Thursday.
Because if what is happening in Iraq is not handled, it will spread, as will what is happening in Syria.
What happens when the virus of terrorism is alive? It spreads.
Nouri al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute of Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, demonstrators were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
The posters were carrying posters accusing him and others of being murderers and appealing to the United States to refuse to give him aid.
Cocaine addict lawyer who tipped Mr Big about police investigation is jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarborough.
The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
It was given a three year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court.
The top defence lawyer who told drug Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about his drug trafficking activities after he was sick with cocaine.
The solicitor, nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief", was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, where he represented in a previous drug trial.
Detectives spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at his home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.
Inquiries revealed that Ditta was a regular user of the drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
In an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
All four suspects were watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
The men and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million and more than £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, reported to criminals because he feared his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was faced with disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting justice after a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
The earlier hearing reported cocaine possession.
The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had regular phone contacts with Ditta in February 2011.
Two Detectives followed the suspect and spotted him coming into the house in and having placed the drugs in the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.
Soon after Scarborough’s drop, Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta who was out at the dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular user of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and claimed he was speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client.
During his arrest Ditta picked his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
In a police interview he told the police he ran an office at his home address and work place.
The court heard he would call major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he previously represented, to tell them what the Detectives knew about them.
When asked about anyone who knows not to break the law, it is a criminal solicitor.
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too close to specific clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communication will probably have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.
It went way beyond the normal boundaries of a lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigate as much as possible to allow them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession but dishonoring it.
Then he got too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Itta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, I would not wait 15 hours to feed information to Mr Scarborough.
After the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta changed from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals.
The addiction to cocaine left him weakened and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organized crime groups who asked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.
Solicitors should maintain the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.
Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Crime and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta, who has also been acquired three counts of possession of cocaine and now threatening the course of justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the law.
We will find you and bring you before the courts.
Scarborough was jailed for 14 years after being found guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
The racket was closed for 153 years for drugs offences.
On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself, which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as Mohammed Ali, and inequality as his motivation for work.
Aretha Franklin Back on Stage in December
The Queen of Soul will perform at the Sound Board hall of MotorCity Casino Hotel on 21 December.
Mrs Franklin has been busy in November recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness she was suffering from, the singer of "Respect" confirmed to the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult to deal with".
She said she was "happy to be back".
Menton Reduces Christmas Lights Cost
With 420 pattern designs and 2.2 kilometers of seafront draped in a light mantel, the bill for the illuminations in Menton could give you a bit of shock.
The bill is usually paid by taxpayers, but not by business associations.
The town has decided to use LEDs to reduce costs.
There has also been a change in management of public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport Evacuated After Shooting
There was a shooting in Los Angeles International Airport.
A man opened fire at 10am local time.
At least two people were injured, according to local police.
One was an employee working for the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the other was the gunman.
The incident occurred in terminal 3 causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed for exits or onto the tarmac.
The police intervened very quickly and the suspect was arrested on the roof of an airport car park.
The airport is currently being evacuated and air traffic has been suspended.
Classical Singing for Teenagers
The student body has, each time, been the target of an initiative that had a lot of success last season.
Teenagers have been given the chance to get a grip on classical singing through five short plays created and performed by regional artists - performances that include a large dose of humor.
In addition to this show, the British Lyric Society will bring back "Destinations Lyriques", a program that has been a huge crowd-puller at La Pulperie in Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will be held in summer 2014, giving regional artists the opportunity to show their skills.
In addition to these events, there was the Lyrique Benefit Concert held last August with the support of the saxophone soprano Marie-Eve Munger.
This, parallel with the art dimension, was a benefit event that helps the non-profit organisation achieve financial balance sheet that sounds as soothing to the ears as a tune from The Fledermaus.
Without giving exact figures, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, used the press conference held at Chicoutimi yesterday to give assurances.
The future is bright, even in the long term.
We have more solid and stable support.
Financially we are on a good course and we hope to see the 50th anniversary of the operetta in seven years.
Beyond that, she added.
The 38-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy school in Surrey is facing six charges, according to the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada.
Omar Moustapha Hassan is accused of hostage-taking, hostage-holding, making threats, carrying a weapon with dangerous intent, abduction and failure to follow order.
The quick response by the police officer involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately was key to the safe ending of this incident.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New Class Action Claim against Holy Cross Brothers
New class action has been filed against the Holy Cross Brothers in relation to sexual assaults allegedly carried out at Saint Joseph Oratory and several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The claim is based on the testimony of an applicant identified as "J. J", who would have been masturbated in 1950s, first at Notre Dame de Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint Joseph Oratory, where he was a altar boy and his father worked as a painter.
The first action involves only three institutions, and when the ruling was announced many people asked us to add my name.
The class action that just been filed allows the inclusion of plaintiffs from any institution where members of the Holy Cross may have been involved in abuses.
Currently, the action combines the complaints of 25 individuals who allegedly have been assaulted by the Holy Cross.
The alleged deeds generally occurred before the first action as many of the institutions involved were closed in the 1960s.
The action states that the Holy Cross and Saint Joseph Oratory, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be committed against children" and that they deliberately and deliberately avoided the problem.
The latter accusations are partly based on letters written by the lawyer of the Holy Cross, Mr Emile Perrin QC in 1990s, and through research carried out in the archive on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of the Holy Cross who has publicly denounced the abuses.
The class action must first be considered admissible by the Superior Court.
After the Court has declared it admissible, it will proceed to the second stage, the preliminary hearings.
In the first action, the Holy Cross Congregation agreed to settle out of court before preliminary hearings were conducted.
Serious Fire in Shop
The fire caused serious damage to a shop in LaSalle district of Montreal on Thursday night.
The emergency services were called around 1am on Friday for a fire which had broken out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the junction with Rue Rejane.
It tool the twenty-two firefighters who rushed to the scene for an hour to bring the flames under control.
The fire caused significant damage to the structure of the building, said the Operations Director of the Montreal Fire Department, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire is unclear, but nobody was in the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on scene.
There were no casualties, but close to 20 flats on the first and second floors of this row of shops had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was called in because the residents of one of the apartment apartments may need temporary accommodation, according to the Fire Department.
Great Opposition to Medically Assisted Death at Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, held in Ottawa this week, follows the vote in favour of the regulation on medical assisted death in Quebec.
The opportunity was offered to restate their disapprove.
When every ill person had access to effective care to relieve their suffering, along with being able to stay at home, very few people would wish to end their lives.
When focus was given on palliative care in Canada, the calls for euthanasia would be minimal.
The Chairperson of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical-assisted death.
Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations if it is adopted.
What is life?" she asked.
The majority of palliative care homes will not help patients die, according to the Vice President of the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
The fellow, who is also the Director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoy Home in Gatineau, believes the service would be useless.
Nobody ever says to us: 'I want to die, give me an injection.'
The Director of the Palliative Care Association of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is confusing people with regard to palliative care.
It is not believed that Ontario will follow suit.
Meanwhile, the Liberal MP of Gatineau, Stephanie Vallee, believes that lifelong death is a necessary concept before the bill can be adopted.
Kenyan press angry at controversial media law
The threat is huge, and it is valid to ask what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?
The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it.
The new media tribunal will always be biased because it is an extension of the government, and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
However, we hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs.
The Star newspaper believes the new bill will effectively hand the government a "monopoly over the media" and The Standard called the bill "draconian."
The passing of the bill is a series of measures to strengthen national security after the September September attack by Islamist gunmen on Westgate shopping mall.
Reports of the attack drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were sent to the scene of the attack, allegedly robbing the upmarket mall.
Chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, but the summons was refused after media outcry.
The new bill allows media houses to be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the risk of being "de-listed" or barred from official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if no fine is paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to destroy most FM stations.”
It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it called Kenya's "lively blogosphere."
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.
No one will ever know," says Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu.
Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in past.
In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their huge salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - among the most high in the world.
Pharmaceutical Year is difficult for Pharmacists
The departure of almost 10 pharmacists from the Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) in Laval has caused turmoil in the management of the Cité-de-Santé hospital in 2012-2013.
The pharmacy department has been left very short-staffed after multiple departures due to retirement, maternity leave or, simply, resignations.
The staff shortage is almost 30%, making the financial year “very difficult” according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
The CSSS has decided not to employ independent labour, which could be up to three times more expensive than taking on a full-time pharmacist.
"We did not resort to a stop-gap solution," explained Beaudet.
"We have consolidated or reduced some of our activities within the institution to get around while waiting for things to fall into place.
We clearly worked hard to persuade our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
A combination of circumstances put us in a difficult situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, 2013-2014 looks like a much better year for the pharmacy department at the CSSS.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after maternity leave and three others have been taken on in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to keep staff on the ground have paid off, as four students currently living in Laval have also decided to stay on at the CSSS.
"Things are going much better now," stressed the pharmacist.
"By the end of the financial year we will have seven new pharmacists and three back from maternity leave.
This will fill the gaps we had last year.
Still growing need
However, the situation is still precarious.
The various factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the prevalence of young women in the profession, make situations like that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
However, the number of staff is always precarious as this is a young environment with a lot of young women working in the field.
"Last year there were many more and no pharmacists available to replace them, so it was more difficult."
22-year old Top Model starts Acting career in Grand Style.
The director Lars von Trier chose her to play the young Charlotte Gainsbourg in his next film, Nymphomaniac.
This pornographic drama in eight chapters will be released in two parts (on January 1st and 8th) chronicles the erotic memories of a forty-year-old who has been hooked on sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder sister is striking: a twig-like figure, transparent complexion and Franco-English origins.
The girl who took risks - she took risks - the girl who avoided naked on glossy paper will be exposing herself in much more dangerous situations on the big screen.
The excerpt from Nymphomaniac caused a lot of excitement on the Internet: it shows Stacy Martin in the middle of a climax in bed with Shia LaBeouf.
The filmmaker may have asked his actors to hide their shame, but he used X-rated film professionals for most dangerous sex scenes, before merging the bodies digitally: the top half is the star, the bottom half is the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses to the limit, always in order to achieve the best.
Stacy Martin is not a subject of conversations.
CGR Theatre in Narbonne Evacuated Thursday Evening
The first showing of a film at the Mega CGR theatre in Narbonne was interrupted on Thursday evening out of precautionary measures after viewers reported tingling sensation in the throat.
The Director immediately started an evacuation procedure and called the fire brigade to check a suspicious smell.
Around 70 people were evacuated from the viewing.
The investigation was carried out, and a thorough check of the cinema revealed no evidence.
What is it?
It was an unforeseen incident?
However, the management of the theatre decided to implement the principle of precaution and put its customers first.
The cinema was ventilated and everyone returned in good order.
The cinema was able to show itself in good light and the customers could continue to enjoy events unfolding...
However, only on screen.
Woman Tries Smuggling 2kg Cocaine In Pumpkins
The woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine inside pumpkins into the country through Montreal-Trudeau Airport on Thursday morning.
Drugs were detected when passenger luggage was checked.
The cocaine was divided between three pumpkins that had previously been fallen out.
The drugs were then taken to the Office of the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada (GRC), which then took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman travelled from when she was intercepted.
The investigation is part of the investigation, according to Jacqueline Roby, spokeswoman for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she was entering the country.
Since the start of 2013, Canada Border Services Agency at Montreal-Trudeau Airport has conducted 173 drug seizures, of which 10 involves seizures of cocaine totaling 44 kilograms.
In 2012 the Border Services Agency for the Province of Quebec made 1,653 seizures of narcotics.
Syria Air Raid
Israeli aircrafts entered Lebanese air space early on Wednesday afternoon but did not launch attacks until the evening, according to the Lebanese army.
A cargo of short range SA-8 ground-to-air missiles was targeted and destroyed.
This latest Israeli air force raid in Syrian territory (the sixth since the start of the year) has not been confirmed by Israel nor Syria.
The raid occurred in almost similar circumstances to that of July 5: on that occasion, an unnamed American official confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack targeting Yakhont ground-to-air missiles supplied to Damascus by Russia.
They failed to hide their anger when Washington revealed the attack, at risk of sending President Assad to respond.
Ukraine Close to Economic Collapse
Ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, reduced Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, casting doubt on the ability of the former Soviet republic to meet its financial obligations.
The government debt rating moved to B-, further down into the category of speculative investments.
This rating is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one chance in three that it will re-rating the rating again in the next year.
However, it is increasingly unlikely that the government will sufficiently guarantee foreign currencies to meet its increasing external financial commitments.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013. The trend is expected to continue.
This complicates the repayment of credit from abroad.
This reserve, which the authorities have used extensively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, is declining, leading to the agency considering devaluation more and more likely, which would inflate the country's foreign debt.
Moreover, Kiev needs liquid assets to pay for its gas imports from Russia, which has a debt of 882 million dollars.
The announcement is a serious threat to Ukraine's government in a period of serious tensions with its Russian neighbor, which is angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
This was made public on the day after the official statistics showing that the country's economy suffered its fifth quarterly drop between July and September.
The debt, which is still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years. S&P estimates it as 33.5% of the GDP, compared to 10% prior to the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country has been asking for aid from the International Monetary Fund for months. The latter, in 2010, gave the country a 15,300 million dollars loan, but this time it has only released 3,400 million.
The IMF is refusing to pay any further installments until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, especially by increasing the price of gas for the population.
After a fruitless mission to the country, the IMF reported this week that "the significant need for external finance" represented weakness, while there were "signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist, Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, no improvement can be expected in the short term.
The expert added that no hope of unpopular reforms being made in the pre-election year, which is expected to occur in 2015.
The only hope is for international improvement.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which for Brussels is conditional on the release of opposition leader Yulia Timochenko.
However, the agreement would be good for business in the long term, but it might have negative consequences in the short term given Russia's reaction.
Moscow, which is responsible for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a free trade area is created between the EU and Kiev, it will have to strengthen its border control for import goods.
US Greenlights Publicis-Omnicom Merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they have not received any objection from the American authorities to their plans to merge, which would closely close the creation of the world's biggest advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second largest agency, Omnicom, and the third largest, Publicis.
The Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiration of the investigation period into the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended.
The authors also pointed to the necessary authorisations from Canada, India and Turkey, as well as those from South Africa and South Korea.
The expiration of the investigation period provided by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy many of the conditions necessary for the move to take place.
The merger is also conditioned on obtaining other regulatory approvals and the approval of the two groups' shareholders.
Congo Army Hunts M23 Rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would be hunting down M23 rebels right up to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 is on the verge of defeat, having been driven out of the northeast of the Republic of Congo (RDC), which it had been in control since the start of the uprising 20 months ago.
”We will pursue the M23 and drive it out of wherever it is hiding because they are criminals,” Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the FARDC, told Reuters.
"We must not allow them to regroup because they have been causing Congolese people suffer for too long.
The time has come for peace to be restored.
Leaders of the M23 say they evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bisimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, asserted on RFI that these military setbacks would not change its demands at the peace talks.
According to the Ugandan mediators,talks between the government in Kinshasa and the M23 started in Kampala on Wednesday.
Conflicts were reported in the hills above Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the rebels to fall this week, and around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion started in 2012.
In November the insurgents took control of Goma, the capital of North Kivu, using the retreat of the government garrison and the inaction of the Monusco blue beets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world’s largest in terms of number, to strengthen its mission and form a rapid intervention force consisting of South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania.
Meanwhile, FARDC staff has been reshuffled and the army has gone on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of progress of the government troops today is unprecedented.
The M23 seems to be near its end, according to an expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa has succeeded in fighting a major insurrection.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no Rwandan armed group is present in the east of the Republic.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda of providing military support to the M23, which initially was made up of mutiny former Congolese soldiers. Rwanda vehemently denied this.
The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, called on the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman announced.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation after shells landed in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana took to the street to welcome the entry of the FARDC troops.
”We have been living with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable that we would be freed by the army,” said a resident of the town on the border with Uganda.
The man added, "We have been living in terror [of M23], we are traumatised," he added.
Testing conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coronavirus turned out to be positive, the Health Minister has announced.
The WHO added that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only confirmed cases in France to date."
The patient was suspected of being infected on Tuesday, after returning from a trip to Saudi Arabia, where the disease has already killed about fifty people.
Chevron, second largest oil company in America, announced a drop in quarterly profits on Friday, as a result of a reduction in refining margins, but its production of oil and gas continued to grow, although its production of oil and gas continued to grow, although its production of oil and gas continued to grow, although its production of oil and gas continued to grow, although its production of oil and gas continued to grow, although its production of oil and gas continued to grow, although its production of oil and gas continued to increase, although its production of oil and gas continued to increase, although its production of oil and gas continued to remain below the group's target.
The net profit for the third quarter went down to $4,950 million, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5,250 million or $2.69 per share, the previous year.
Analysts questioned by Reuters were expecting an average profit of $2.71 per share.
The group produced 2.59 million oil-equivalent barrels per day during the quarter, an increase from the 2.52 million barrels per day produced in the year before.
The company is targeting 2.65 million barrels per day for this year, with an increase of 25% in production planned for 2017.
The majority of the growth in the years to come will come from its liquefied natural gas schemes in Australia.
Because of the cost of these schemes, annual investment costs have gone up by seven thousand million dollars in two years and are expected to reach 36,700 million dollars in 2013.
The production activities declined slightly in the second quarter, while downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell 45% to 380 million dollars.
The reduction in refining margins is affecting the entire sector.
Chevron’s main competitors, Exxon, also announced a drop in net profits on Thursday, despite a increase in its gas and oil production.
School Transport: Accepted complaint
Since the start of the academic year, the Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) has been demanding a $150 fee per student (up to $300 per family) for students using school transport to get to two addresses, a service that the organisation provides when it is able to.
No financial contribution was requested prior to the last budget change.
The Board proposed a mediation service and I was interested.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and she asked for an additional period for consideration.
It is always better to discuss, consult and find solutions to such issues, she believes.
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) did not wish to comment on the issue.
The organisation simply stated that the mediation was part of a process arising from a complaint.
Row Over Closure of Emergency Unit at Hôtel-Dieu
In light of the continued revolt among staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "put back the project schedule and particularly the date for closing the emergency unit which cannot be completed on November 4".
This was an official request to “avoid any risks when dealing with emergency services in Paris at the start of winter”, but also to prevent damage to the Socialist Party's campaign a few months before local elections.
The minister's instructions are still expected to take effect on this date.
At APHP, officials prefer the term "transformation or change in continuity" to closure.
From November 4, the fire brigade units, which accounted for about half of the 40,000 cases brought to the Emergency Unit of the Hôtel-Dieu every year, will have received instructions to take about 30 serious cases per day to other hospitals in Paris.
November 4 is also the day on which hospital training starts.
At Hôtel-Dieu, emergency medicine interns will make way for five general medicine interns on Monday.
The transfer of internal medicine beds is planned for some point during the month.
The Hôtel-Dieu emergency service must close as soon as possible, and for us that's November 4," Loïc Capron, the Chairman of the Medical Committee (CME) at APHP, says straightforwardly.
Since November 4, patients will no longer be brought by the fire brigade, but they will only be brought by their own means.
However, we will continue to accept emergency cases, emphasizing the permanent presence of emergency medical service vehicles on site to move critical cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he added.
The decision to close the emergency service is based on the regional health agency (ARS).
Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, says no change in the service offered by November 4.
The minister has either lied to us or been lied to.
Following his early retirement from his position as Head of Emergency Services in early July, he defines himself as a "whistleblower" in the face of a "cynical" decision by the "technical medical administration body".
They are in the process of abandoning and killing off emergency units that were reformed less than five years ago.
If the other emergency services in Paris could absorb the surplus, there would not be a problem.
The strains are regularly saturated.
Examples are sometimes nine hours wait at the emergency unit at Lariboisière.
The ARS stressed that these patients "deported" to several locations does not represent an "avalanche" for other emergency services, where human resources would have been reinforced anyway.
The ARS, like APHP, is defending the "new hospital model" which started implementing on October 7 and is expected to continue taking 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, self-employed GPs are also expected to participate in the implementation of an "ambulatory care service".
Where do we go if we start asking people to self-diagnose? asked Gérald Kierzek, who believes that the concept of a non-major emergency is "dangerous" and marks a "medical step back".
"The same thing will happen as with level 3 maternity units.
People are not stupid, they will go wherever the best care is offered.
If the minister does not take a step by Monday, we will take a different approach.
"We will have a greater presence in local election campaigns and we will consider putting up a list."
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morzite's team, Vincent Roger, UMP councillor in Paris and MP of the 4th arrondissement, states clearly that "even if the UMP in Paris supports the continuation of emergency services at Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if you look at the duties."
Ann Hidalgo, the Socialist Party's candidate, repeated on Monday morning on France Inter that she was in favor of a moratorium to prevent the closure on November 4.
If it goes ahead, she would register her clear disagreement, says Bruno Juillard, her spokesman.
Although the reorganisation of the Hôtel-Dieu has a basic reason, we cannot allow this to happen without an acceptable plan for the transfer of patients to other hospitals.
Obama Ends Spying on IMF and World Bank
Secretary of State Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop tapping the lines of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities, according to an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of attempts by the White House to resume control of the NSA phone-tapping affair following revelations by the former NSA analyst, Edward Snowden, who has taken refuge in Russia.
This is the first time that surveillance of the IMF and World Bank by the Intelligence Agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.
When asked about this, an American official replied: "The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance at the World Bank and IMF offices in Washington.
The official kept his anonymity, without specifying whether such surveillance has been conducted in the past.
Other official reported that Obama had given the order to stop these practices in recent weeks.
The instruction was given almost the same time as the end to phone-tapping of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this regard, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved strengthening of the control on government surveillance programs on Thursday, but kept them operating.
The Committee introduced new restrictions on the data the Intelligence Services were authorised to collect and established a five year limit on the length of time they could hold such data.
UN calls new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is starting work on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals, which were placed 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
The draft document was included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard at the summit.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that now is the time to rise above national interests.
”I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to set universal sustainable development goals - SDGs,” he added.
This SDG will build on our advances under the millennium development goals, and they will be integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not spare any effort to implement the mandates given to me by Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash
With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, standing on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans.
Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearful about her country's future, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with "we demand security" in Portuguese as she joined the crowd in the Capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
The past two weeks have been almost daily reports of fighting between government forces and Renamo, some of the most serious fighting since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as a strategy to destabilise the country's independent government.
After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the rapidly growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north could attract more than $50bn of investment from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo says the government initiated the latest clash by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold.
The attacks on the former rebels continued as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for causing the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.
Guatemala President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
According to Mr Guebuza, Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his force to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist on avoiding war.
The concern has grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.
The FT told the FT that the agreement was no longer being adhered to by Frelimo.
”Our vision is to return to negotiations but with seriousness,” Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions caused by a series of clashes this year.
The Mozambique debate is two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) fighting head together.
No of them are good negotiators and no of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are needed.
Renamo, which has been fighting for electoral reforms, has already announced that it would not participate in November municipal elections.
Presidential and Parliamentary polls are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt to win concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Since 1992 Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.
Mazanga says Mr Guebuza is threatening to destroy the country's democracy.
”He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,” Mr Mazanga said.
Renamo is unclear how much capacity it has, but it has carried out disturbing hit-and-run attacks on key north-south highway.
Most of the fighting has occurred in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, depend on to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about Renamo’s threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.
The instability has added to frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent cases of kidnapping.
They believe the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just want stability.
No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, free access to the road.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life", author says.
The Tales of Thor could show "brute strength is no match for subtle trickery," while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of dreaming.
According to Crossley-Holland, many of the myths are far too wild, too scandalous and some cases far too filthy to be taught in schools.
'I find it wonderful that in America, myth and folklore have already taken place in education'.
I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
The author and teacher being "overtly didactic" is a total switch-off for children, with messages being "subliminated" into enjoyable stories.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as writing the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, advised: "You may have intentions but you better keep them out of sight."
The main difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the need for some hope.
No explanation or happy ending is needed, but that there is an innate sense of good and evil.
The truth must be subliminated; revealed through a story rather than stated.
The old basis of showing not telling.
The fighter of Hamas' armed wing was killed this evening and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza report.
According to these sources, the activists were conducting surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel, when they were shelled by an Israeli tank.
NSA Spying: United States "went too far" Kerry admits
The United States sometimes goes too far with its espionage activities, Secretary of State John Kerry recognised in his first admission from Washington, which is deep in dispute with Europe over the mass collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denial, this is the first time an official of the American government has explicitly admitted controversial activities in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
In some cases I accept, as the President, that some of these activities went too far and we guarantee that this will not happen in the future.
In his relayed speech, and in the presence of his British counterpart, William Hague, the head of the American diplomatic service explained the intelligence practices and collection of data as part of the necessary fight against terrorism and preventing possible attacks.
Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry reported that the American authorities have since prevented several planned attacks thanks to the interception of communication and data collection.
Because we have prevented planes being blown up, buildings being broken up and people being murdered, we have been able to stay informed prior to the attacks.
Then, John Kerry added, "I assure you that no innocent person has been misled during this process."
Yet America strives to collate data.
However, in some cases it went too far in an inappropriate way, the Secretary of State added.
The President asserted that he had "resolved to clarify the matter and initiated a re-examination of these practices to ensure no-one was misled".
The debate between Americans and Europeans continues to grow this week with new revelations in the press.
The Washington Post reports that the NSA has been intercepting data of hundreds of million of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which quotes documents from the former NSA consultant, Edward Snowden, states that the programme, which was conducted in collaboration with the UK counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, enabled them to collect data from the fibre-optic cables used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected in the month of January alone - ranging from meta data on emails to text elements or audio and video files.
These interceptions apparently occurred outside the USA.
However, Yahoo and Google have denied any involvement in these practices.
The latest news in France, Germany, Spain and Italy has been reported that the NSA has intercepted massive quantities of data and communications from US allies and their leaders, especially the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
After the outrage of European states, and while leaks to American press stated that the American President is not up to date with these activities, he has refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.
The head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of European citizens’ communication.
The European Intelligence Services, allegedly took control of these communications before passing them on to the NSA.
This concerned military operations in countries where the NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this absolutely did not target Europe, according to General Alexander.
The discord spread to Asia on Friday.
Australian ambassador was summoned to Indonesia, whose mission is suspected of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network, which has also aroused the ire of China.
Paris Saint-Germain will face Lorient on Friday without its trump card, the Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is suffering from an injury, the Ligue 1 club announced in a press release.
PSG, who are in the top position ahead of Monaco on goal difference, issued the team sheet for the match, which is the 12th of the season, on which the 32-year-old striker did not play.
The press release only mentioned that he is "injured" without specifying what the injury was.
However, he was suffering from inflammation on the left knee after returning from international duty this month.
Ceremony in Memory of the Dead
The Père Lachaise crematorium is organizing a lay ceremony at 11am in memory of all those cremated at the establishment this year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for Paris mayorship, is expected to attend and later explain her proposals on funeral matters at a press conference.
Click above to watch the ceremony.
More and more French people are going to choose cremation for their own funerals than inhumation, according to an Ipsos survey conducted on September 6 and 7 among 1,009 people.
It is opposite for the death of a loved one - the French prefer inhumation (53% against 47%).
Only 15% of those who lose a child choose cremation.
In his book, La Mort en Cendres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice chair of the National Committee for Human Rights and Epidemiology, highlights the "violence" that cremation represents for those left behind.
With cremation, there is a sense of "violence committed against the body of a loved one" that will be reduced to a pile of ashes in very short time, instead of a decomposition process that would accompany the grief stage.
The latter is a "symbolic violence" that relates to the "obstruction of the person's singularity and distinctive symbols", which are reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is this accepted without difficulty in Nordic and protestant countries, but still takes badly in France?
Because cremation is a recent development, says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Thanatological Society and author of the book Apprivoise the Death.
The Catholic Church only started tolerating it in 1963, a fact that has restricted efforts to get to grip with it.
According to François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of Funeral Services for the City of Paris, getting to grip with cremation is about giving the dead a dignified ceremony as it would have been with an inhumation.
The annual Ipsos survey shows the strength of attachment to the event.
77% of French want one for their loved ones, be it religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Today, 73% of people who choose cremation want a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want one.
Crematoria have adapted to this change in society.
They have been trying to prevent families from feeling violence by waiting for an hour and half, doing nothing, followed by immediately handing them the ashes.
70% of establishments now offer a Master of Ceremonies to conduct the following ritual in the presence of the body: greet the congregation, mention the deceased by name, connect the deceased to the present, evoke who the person was, give sense to their death, organise a farewell.
This is what has been happening at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
The ceremonies are often people who have moved into this new type of employment.
There are also former Catholic priests.
The Père Lachaise crematorium has been organizing a number of memorial ceremonies, lay and non-religious, on All Saints Day, to which it invites the families of all those who have been cremated during the year.
The second year, one of these ceremonies has been relayed online for those who cannot attend.
The crematorium has given permission to broadcast it.
Rehousing Due to Rats Causes Strife in La Seyne
The start of this week, a family abandoned their ground floor apartment in Fructidor D2 because of the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Office offered exceptional, provisional rehousing for the couple and three children in a new four-room house.
However, the family refused to accept the request for financial reasons and the situation is at stalemate.
The matter has become exaggerated, says Joël Canapa, office director.
"There have always been rats in towns.
The rat extermination company conducts two operations per year.
Hence we have carried out 64 operations since last winter.
The area has not been abandoned and rats are not coming into the town.
Environmental protection and public health concerns have changed, but we are not going to kill a child for two rats.
The family left its home and moved into a hotel.
"We will soon be penniless and we are waiting for a new house at the same rate as the old one."
Tokyo Stock Exchange Closes 0.88% Down
The Tokyo stock exchange was down at close time on Friday, despite good manufacturing figures from China.
The list suffered as a result of the decline of the dollar against the yen, which is harmful to export values, and of the annual profit warning issued by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index slipped 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix was 11.23 points (0.94%) down, at 1,183.03.
Sony slipped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
House Engulfed in Flames in Old Quebec
The fire that started at midday on Friday in Old Quebec was quickly reduced.
More than 30 FIREMEN rushed to 9 Rue Hébert.
The fire started in a three-bedroom apartment house on four floors, located behind the yard of the Quebec Seminary.
All the tenants were out when the fire started.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firemen in their numbers to intervene.
The first firemen arrived and they could clearly see the smoke.
The alarms went off one after another as it took reinforcement to deal with the building, because the building is close together.
The investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
The birthplace of standup comedy in America is New York City, where the elderly baron Frank Fay, who served as the Master of Ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.
Fay's innovation has been extended throughout the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and controlled by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.
These headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to great success, to the point where they are too big to play a club.
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, and Bill Cosby.
As the festival expands, so does the world of comedy.
The most important actors participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels, such as smaller networks like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gorgeous fantasy-football-themed "The League") and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Park and Recreation," but she is most known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the silly, racially focused Anthony Jeselnik, the very emotional Anthony Jeselnik, the very racially focused W. Kamau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
The festival's most important draw will be an interview with David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting is held at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
The city is certainly in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
Then he told me that, when he's here, he sometimes walks down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Oil extends drop to $96 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
Benchmark US crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Supply of crude has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said Wednesday that US supplies increased 4.1 million barrels last week.
Five weeks later, supplies have risen by more than 25 million barrels.
The evidence of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an uptick in activity.
The forecast shows China's economic recovery could continue after growth bounced to 7.8 percent in the second quarter from a two-decade low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
Abortion Law in Texas Challenged
The federal appeal court in Texas has reintroduced some restrictions on voluntary abortion, which was previously blocked by a trial judge this week.
The decision means that a legal text adopted in the state in July generally challenging abortion will be able to become in force.
The decision by the appeal court means that doctors who practice abortion will have an "admitting privilege" with local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre to perform a diagnosis or procedure, based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital.
Defenders of abortion argue that the law may lead to the immediate closure of a third of the clinics in the state, as these clinics have failed to obtain the permission for their practitioners.
All, about 22,000 women will be deprived of access to such establishments.
On Monday, the day before the law was due to come into force, a trial judge found that the provisions regarding admitting privileges were unconstitutional.
The Attorney General for Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is canvassing for the role of governor, asked the court of appeal to overturn the judgement from the trial court blocking the application of the law.
The plenary hearing on the matter is planned for January.
The New Star took a big comeback in terms of audiences, with 1.3 million TV viewers, which is a 5.6% share of the viewing audience.
What was the show?
The jury took 10,000 candidates to face the jury for this 10th season: Maurane, the naughty Sinclair and Olivier Bas.
The viewers shared their thoughts on Twitter.
The excitement of finding their favorite programme has subsided, and many are disappointed.
What were they so disappointed?
None of the contestants seem to have really stood out at first glance.
As every year, the first audition shows throw in a wide range of young singers into the mix, sometimes for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Then, on Twitter people want a spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
However, a few got just that.
Many people have tried La Nouvelle Star, and some have even survived.
Behind the TV screens, there are always those cut out to be successful singers season after season.
Others are just out to make you laugh.
Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy
The federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop and frisk program and removed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in August ruled that the city violated the Constitution in its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department change its policy and training program.
The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the request for stay.
The appeals court said the judge was removed from the case because she ran afoul of the U.S. Code of Conduct for Judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding to criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers wrongly targeted black and Hispanic men with its stop and frisk program.
The outside monitor was appointed to oversee major changes, including reforms in policy, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some areas where most stops occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and address of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.
The oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticised by several civil rights advocates.
Stopped and frisking has been around for a long time, but recorded stops increase dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to a record all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.
The lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and changed into a class action case.
Supporters of the change to the NYPD stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.
Critics say the changes would reduce police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers in the last decade.
The judge noted she was not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.
Residents have to go and vote, as they average $100 a month in the cost of their accommodation that goes to the City in taxes.
If the owner pays $5000 in municipal taxes, he divides this figure between each house.
We are forced to increase rent to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we are sending a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates have told us that they would tackle this scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay $100,000 for fireworks, $4-5 million for land just in case...
Go and vote, that is the best way to express yourself and say enough is enough.
End of the Road for Elysée Head Chef
The cook entered the 500m2 space of the Elysée Palace as an assistant after working in diplomatic missions, and climbed up the ladder to become head chef nine years ago.
The former French president has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, including at their holiday homes, and has fed an uncountable number of world figures, surrounded by a cloud of anonymity that only emerges today, as he retires at 60.
Born on 24 October 1953 in La Ferte-Saint-Aubin, the man with open face, bald head and intellectual eyes is the holder of a certificate of professional competence in confectionery.
The mother was a cook in a Château in Sologne.
'I have moved from one château to another' says Bernard Vaussion, a very interesting person.
The Head of State or his partner or wife choose the menu.
"Madame Chirac was a little more involved and would go right into the kitchen," to the point where she forbade women to enter the Elysée Palace kitchens!
With all due respect to heads of state who appeared relatively undifferent to earth's fruits, "they are all fond of food" Bernard Vaussion reveals graciously.
Jacques Chirac certainly had a more refined palate.
With Nicolas Sarkozy, who forbade cheese, the plates always came back full!
François Hollande, who introduced cheese, is a man who likes to eat and is not very choosy.
The current Head of State, who has taken back on the pounds he lost during the presidential campaign, does not have a specific diet requirement.
Bernard Vaussion remembers the pressure that would be on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at Elysée, where one would have to serve around 200-250 people in around an hour.
The night before would be practically sleepless.
Such people would not understand if something went wrong.
The now former Elysée Chef, who shared a drink with his team, family and friends, is leaving with a sorrow.
The prayer was abundant.
Human side came out, he says.
The chef will be replaced by his assistant, 35-year-old Guillaume Gomez, who has been at Elysée for seventeen years.
1850 Quebec House Fire
The historic house built in 1850 in Old Quebec was swollen on Friday at lunchtime.
The four-apartment building at 15 Rue Hébert set off three alarms at the fire department.
The fire started at the front, but spread to all three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the quick response of the fire brigade prevented the spread of the fire to adjacent buildings, a major challenge in this part of the city where the buildings are very close together.
The building damaged by the fire contained four apartments, but nobody was home when the fire started.
The damage was fairly limited, although water caused some harm.
The investigation will be conducted to determine the cause, but the fire brigade has ruled out the possibility of it being a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Second Trailer Released
Martin Scorsese has released footage from his next film, which is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget being sensible and grab your ticket.
Leonardo DiCaprio will take your breath in his role as crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us a true story about a "Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities over a massive corruption scheme on Wall Street".
In 1980s, Jordan Belfort goes on a scam that would make him a very rich man.
We see his meteoric rise but also the vertiginous fall that follows.
Out of control, he indulges in parties, women and drugs.
Decadence and all sorts of excess are key words in this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio duo seem to have rediscovered the magic that brought them together in Shutter Island.
The new Scorsese release is late because the editing has taken longer than planned.
The final version of the film will last 2 hours 45 minutes.
The film will be released on December 25 and will be released during the Oscars.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip
Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about a affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.
The Old Bailey reported that the World News heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was meeting his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper tasked Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepping" her, the court heard.
The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson is not the man who stands outside people's homes looking for catch them out, he is the man who likes to give the story to people to see what they will say.
The NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
Editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.
What about first?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says he doesn't, we say "Yes, he did".
Reports of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW feature desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "Don't bother, she's with Charles."
The tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as "Projects."
During the period she was investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.
Meanwhile, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and reporter James Weatherup took charge of the surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.
Then sending her a voicemail on June 18 2005 Coulson told her: "I have a story that we are planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about."
Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny collaborating with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.
Mulaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.
Obama to Meet Iraqi Prime Minister as Violence Rages
The American President will receive the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri Al Maliki, who is seeking the United States' help in the fight against the strongest wave of violence in five years, on 1 November 2013.
October was the bloodiest month in Iraq in five and half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 01 November.
964 people (including 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers) were killed in October violence and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN has reported even higher numbers with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
The violence is growing more and more deadly despite increasing security measures and large scale military operations undertaken by Nouri Al Maliki's government, which is dominated by Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence renewed threats of unrest while the country's neighbor, Syria, is in the grip of civil war.
Bombs strike markets, mosques, weddings and funeral ceremonies.
People are attacked in street and even at home, and security forces are also frequent target of the attacks.
The growing discontent among the Sunni minority, which held power under Saddam Hussein, is now complaining of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests.
The latest violence in Iraq left four people dead, a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, including five booby-trapped cars being blown up in north Baghdad.
The majority of the violence is attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), which is also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a global war against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of the United States talks with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received by President Obama on Friday, two years after their last meeting on December 12, 2011.
The American President, who was elected on the promise of bringing to an end the US military involvement in the country, painted a positive picture of the situation.
Nouri Al Maliki has been meeting several government officials and members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of security aid for Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
However, they have also criticised Shiite Nouri Al Maliki, which has been linked to the resumption of violence because of his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
The Iraqi parliament has also requested that Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our relationship with our two countries".
Beijing Accuses Uighur Group of Tiananmen Attack
The head of internal security in China accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang on Friday of being behind the car bomb attack in Tiananmen Square in the centre of Beijing, which left five people dead.
The vehicle, an SUV, started to race towards the crowd in the famous square in the capital, the symbol of bloody 1989 suppression, before catching fire, killing its three occupants and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the politburo in charge of internal security issues, claimed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement as the cause for the attack.
Numerous Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
The Chinese government believes the movement is responsible for frequent outbreaks of violence in the province, sparked by demands for independence.
The violence that occurred in Beijing was organized and pre-planned, said Meng on Hong Kong television channel Phoenix TV.
The group hiding behind the scene was the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which was translated by the Xinhua News Agency.
The Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle, whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin, and stated that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The vehicle also held containers full of petrol and a flag with orthodox religious writing on it.
The incident left 42 people injured.
East Turkestan Islamic Movement is considered by the United States and the United Nations to be a terrorist organization.
Vatican Poll on Contraception, Divorce and Sexuality
The Vatican is to conduct a large scale survey across the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorces and same-sex couples.
The poll will ask participants how priests treat gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without marriage bonds.
The poll was sent to every national conference of bishops in mid October, with instructions to secure as many responses as possible.
The information will be used at a major family assembly that Pope Francis is planing to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
The spokesperson for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the best way to approach parishioners.
In the UK, bishops have published the poll on the Internet and asked Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army Attacks Last Rebel Stronghold
The M23 diehards, who are many, have established themselves at an altitude of near 2,000 metres in the farmland hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located around 80km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
The fight has not stopped since morning and is continuing despite the dark.
The fighting has a little reduced intensity, and it seems that the DRC Armed Forces (FARDC) have pushed the rebels back a bit.
According to this witness, who chose to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going into action for a "combing operation".
The sound of light arms could clearly be heard in the background.
From Bunagana, a political stronghold and last preserve of the rebellion, an AFP journalist heard the detonation of heavy arms.
The fight has entered the final phase, with the FARDC surrounding the remaining M23 positions to flush them out.
Since the resumption of the fighting between March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO has not participated directly in the fight, but it is providing critical support in intelligence, observation and planning.
After the afternoon, several dozen well-equipped soldiers headed off towards the front.
The soldiers were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
Then, on the road to Bunagana, the frontier post with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded up a multiple rocket launcher on a new truck belonging to the FARDC, intended to take over from another device fighting the position of the M23 in the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, called on the rebels to "stand down voluntarily" or be disarmed "by force".
The political leaders of the M23 are looking for an agreement there.
Ugandan mediators are now organizing the signing of the agreement, although this information was not confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born of an April 2012 mutiny by former rebels, mainly Tutsis, who were integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23. Kigali and Kampala have denied the accusations.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its land is rich in mineral resources.
At Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, around 5,000 people fled from Monday to Wednesday, according to the UN, the return process started in the morning and was reversed at midday.
The AFP was told by Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
The gunfire seems to be getting closer to the population.
Early that evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with mattresses on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
Musicals, the Great Performances
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, song and dance productions are starting to take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris is finally finding its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical is establishing itself as a successful genre.
The majority of attempts, from Notre Dame de Paris' to 'Mozart, the Rock Opera' have been embroiled in ridiculousness.
The success of such acts as 'Cabaret' or 'Les Misérables' have had a mysterious air about them.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment at Mogador has changed all that.
Today, these two stage are producing hits.
The latter is reprising its excellent 'My Fair Lady' this Christmas and has announced the global production of 'American in Paris' as followup.
The Mogador, 'The Belle and the Bête' could be one of the season's most important successes.
Other stages, musicals such as '1789: The Ladies of the Bastille' and small productions such as 'Disco' or 'Life and Times' are falling in line with the success and quality recorded so far.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book 'Historys of musical theatre' and speaker at the Châtelet Theatre, analyses the reasons for the hard-won success.
How are French musical trends?
The choice is growing.
Firstly there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the will of the producers...
Some use lovely projections of images and a true story, such as '1789: The Ladies of the Bastille'.
Others leap back fifteen years, under the pretext that you can do pretty much anything you want with Matt Pokora leading the bill.
Then there are the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet, which allow us to bring the golden age of Broadway back to life and rediscover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest composer alive.
Stage Entertainment popularizes variety English musicals by adapting them into French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
The projects underway such as 'Rent', 'The Fairy Bath' or 'The Spring Awakening' are having difficulties finding finance.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, acting and dancing as on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musicals in a season, then it's a good year.
We have 200 talented artists who move from project to project.
In USA, the birthplace of the musical is very different.
Young actors are trained in these skills in several schools.
There are many jobs in regional theatres, touring companies, Broadway, off Broadway etc.
The breeding ground for talent is as large as the number of available roles.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the provinces remain the poorest relative of culture in France.
The most important theatre productions go on tour and most of them are usually "boulevard theatre", which is usually aimed at adults, not adolescents.
Musicals fill that gap.
This is the same young people that love reality television and the ephemeral stars it produces...
Offers good (often talented) men a lead role in a musical guarantees the adoration of young girls and often their whole family.
The Facebook pages for these shows are skilled managed by professionals who answer questions.
The shows are eagerly expected by the time they reach a provincial Zénith (theatre).
The musicals are prepared in Paris and enjoyed in the provinces.
The show is designed to be staged in any major theatre in France in the same format as in Paris.
One serious injured in Accident with wrong way driver on Brussels Ring Road
The road accident on the Brussels inner ring road near Hoeilaart in direction Waterloo at 5.30am on Friday morning left one person seriously injured.
The car driven by the injured woman was hit by a driver who was traveling in the wrong direction and remained unhurt.
The section of the ring road where the accident occurred was closed to traffic until 9am for the road to be cleared and for an expert to establish the circumstances of the accident.
This situation however did not create traffic jam as the accident occurred at the exit of Hoeilaart.
Traffic was diverted via the exit/entrance to the ring road.
Child Seriously Injured on Ride at Disneyland Paris
A child aged five has been seriously injured after an accident on a ride at Disneyland Paris.
The life is not in danger but he is still in hospital.
The boy was with his father on the "Pirates of the Carribean" boat ride when he fell.
The ride has been closed until further notice.
DRC: Army Prepares New Assault
Children play on a charred tank that belonged to M23 rebels, at Kibumba in the east of the DRC on 31 October 2013.
On Friday the Congolese army prepared to attack the last bases of the M23 rebels close to Bunagana in the east of the DRC.
The aim of the assault is to wipe out the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Today we took Bugina hill, which overlooks Mbuzi hill.
Today, Mbuzi is expected to fall as well.
Then only Rumyoni hill will be left.
Chanzu hill is not strategic, North Kivu governor Julien Paluku told the AFP.
Paluku is expected to be in Bunagana on Saturday.
The town, which is a political stronghold and the last base of the rebellion, lies on the border with Uganda, around 80km north of Goma.
It was recaptured by the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) on Wednesday.
Since then, several hundred M23 diehards have been cut off in the farmland hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the neighbouring town of Jomba at an altitude of near 2,000 metres.
In Jomba, a local contact who had reported fighting at close quarters throughout Thursday said the situation had been "calm since this morning".
The woman and child were killed in fighting the previous evening and were buried.
The little girl suffered injuries from gunfire, and three other people were wounded, the witness added.
Since the resumption of hostilities between the FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, either side has not given any reports of casualties.
NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance
On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
The mission of the investigation was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The BfV wanted to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and Germany in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, repeatedly insisted that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal trade secrets of foreign companies for US companies to enhance international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.
Since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, started releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the Director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazil’s oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have taken the corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.
The last straw came when it was revealed that Merkel's phone had been bugged for about a decade.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targeters.
Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
Companies in Germany believe the US is almost as big as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.
In all the documents leaked by Mr Snowden, there has been no evidence that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.
Political experts have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
The German parliament says we should build a German Google.
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...
The way is not the way, Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.
If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one should not have let it die 20 years ago.
All is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All but the IT industry.
The reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a surprise to some companies who previously thought the biggest threat to surveillance was posed by China.
The big change is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware of the US jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
The survey was conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, and some 10 percent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.
Chief Executive of SAP says: "We see a new question from customers that has not come up in a year - where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction?"
The latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and that these data must be guarded at all costs.
The economic spying is not a surprise.
It has always occurred.
The topic has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed through the current discussion.
The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this gives advantage to an attacker.
For large companies, the message has long been spread home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room is unwise, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
According to Germany’s BfV, executives should consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.
The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.
However, small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.
Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorised access.
The US warns its own companies about economic surveillance by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in second tier of offenders who engage in economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
The board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "French are the worst."
According to Squarcini, the intelligence services know that all countries, even as they cooperate in the anti-terrorist fight, spy on their allies.
Parents of Georgia teen who died in 'freak accident' believe son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a rolled up wrestling mat in his high school gym believe they were murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.
Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the family disputes that.
They absolutely believe their son was murdered, Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff explained.
They believe that it defies logic, physics and common sense, Crump said.
The family believes this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for his death.
The family sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag.
Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
What was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I am of the opinion that sufficient basis exists" for a formal investigation, he said.
According to Moore, Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."
The second autopsy listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.
There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed.
Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.
The southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents hope the video will contain clues to how he died.
CDC issues children’s allergy guidelines for schools
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such guidelines the US government has issued, as the number of school-aged children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.
The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.
It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked, the EpiPen brand autoinjector being most commonly used to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.
Kids may say, "I feel like something is poking my tongue," "My tongue feels like hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."
NSA Affair Emphasizes Complete Lack of Intelligence Debate
Why the contradictory attitude of the French government? On the one hand, it publicly takes offence and calls the US Ambassador on October 21 and on the other, it forbids the Bolivian president's plane to enter its airspace on the basis of a rumor that Edward Snowden was on board?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Obama, or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius calls the US Ambassador, they are responding to a real discovery, that of the scale of America's surveillance of communications in France generally.
The following is not surprising to read in the pages of Le Monde, on the one hand, a reproduction of diplomatic correspondence with the US and on the other, a condemnation of the NSA's spying on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quay of Orsay in a matter of weeks?
There is no hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic method is not to adopt a moral position, but to investigate the significance and relevance of information and allow every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks reveals the American administration's monitoring of political and other issues worldwide, we consider this to be a significant enlightenment to the American government.
In describing American methods of data interception in relation to the French diplomatic representation in the United States, we do not aim at making a complaint about this practice, but rather describing the world as it is.
Has France benefited from the intelligence supplied by the NSA concerning terrorist operations against our interests?
How can we do without collaboration with the Americans?
The setting up of high performance interception technology over practically ten years by the United States - and by France - has officially been justified by the fight against terrorism.
In particular, France and the USA have implemented procedures, sometimes described as essential, for cooperating and sharing information on almost daily basis.
Examples include France was informed of the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal area of Miranshah through the NSA's resources.
Also France may, for example, transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the Americans and, in return, the Americans may provide information to the French about other parts of the world.
The question at the heart of the NSA affair is not so much the capacity or right of a country to use such tools, as the lack of prior debate - especially in parliaments - on the purpose of such systems, the extent to which they should be used and, ultimately, the issue of infringement of freedoms.
What risk do the United States actually run? Ruining its image?
However much we denounce the US, I see no way to punish it.
The risk against Americans could be twofold.
The first is when their allies - as has been the case recently - learn that their governments have been monitored, sometimes at the highest level.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries with strained relations with the United States.
Other effects could be more commercial: in light of the revelations, more and more European and South American countries are hesitant to trust their confidential data to American providers that are subject to American law and thus to the NSA.
Finally, the widespread exercise in revelations conducted by the media, which is contributing to a debate on surveillance practices by intelligence services that have been almost invisible to the public since now, could force legislators - including those of America - to reconsider their intelligence agencies.
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'
Germany became the first European country to recognise a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.
No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.
The new law does not require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to reduce pressure on parents who may make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, told years later, "I am not man nor woman."
I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.
An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is either boy or girl.
Their sexual development is a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development, a term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles), or unusual genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still unclear, but most experts in the United States agree that if sex is not determined, it is better to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before surgery.
New York City psychiatrist Dr Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersex children pose a ethical challenge.
They have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children do not.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions about why this happens.
It is like the mystery of why people are gay.
The report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as they are not gender related but rather related to their biological makeup, which is not exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.
The features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, boobs and stature; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also includes an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the field of work, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias.
Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.
Currently, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a “third gender” on official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first "genderless person" after winning a legal appeal to keep an unspecified gender status for life.
German passports will have a third designation other than M or F-X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be removed from school textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online has also rejected the German law, writing that "as the world is being moved into a new state where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization."
One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.
Parents are able to be stressed enough without extra limitations, especially if you do not know the gender of your child.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the gorgeous Greek god who had dual sexuality.
And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be eradicated and then redrawn.
However, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.
'Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.
When these children were born you did not call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The most common theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was developed by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was malleable.
The term "gender identity" was coined as a theory that social and environmental cues interacted with the child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.
In one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
The father of a boy whose penis was severed in botched circumcision advised parents to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not.
When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher added that now some doctors are still "practicing that model."
In 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward "not happy with the outcome."
Bruce was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors could not be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and believed he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
The female hormones were given at age 12.
I knew I wasn't a girl, he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he was set for vaginoplasty.
However, depressed and knowing something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was horrifying.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.
Surgery rendered him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattt, executive of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, says the German law "invites labeling and stigma."
Parents are concerned that the German rule will encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an undetermined childhood.
We fear it will encourage intervention.
We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.
The law is yet to be enforced, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Matti says that she supports the Australian law because it allows adults to choose to be recognised in a third gender.
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender.
German law is about assigning it at birth.
It is not a battle young children should take up at this point.
When they grow, they can make decisions about their own body.
However, Dr Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.
Baratz daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.
If she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
The law gives parents some space to not rush into making decisions themselves, according to Baratz.
It gives them time to test and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'
This way you are OK - raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.
We do not have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.
They are getting into the decision and it takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they do not feel they are doing the right thing.
The child will ultimately decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with - and that's a wonderful thing.
It encourages children to make the decision for themselves.
Letta Optimist about Government's Survival
The Italian Council President, Enrico Letta, believes his government will last until 2015, despite strong tensions between the left and right wings in the leadership coalition in the runup to the Senate vote on Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
The centre-right leader told La Stampa that he was "very willing" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The Upper House of the Italian parliament will meet this month to decide on the future of the former president, who was found guilty of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi is threatening to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate, which has more opponents than supporters, decides to reduce him from his duties.
The other section of his camp, centered around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL), Angelino Alfano, is still supporting the government, as it demonstrated on October 2 when it refused to follow Berlusconi's orders on a previous attempt to bring down the cabinet.
The LA Times reports that an agent of the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and a suspect have been wounded in an exchange of gunfire.
Emergency workers called to the scene of the drama confirmed that they had responded to a call reporting "multiple injuries".
"Law enforcement agents are at the scene," the airport stated on its Twitter account, while television pictures showed people being evacuated in ambulances.
There was a shoot-out, a spokesman for the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) told the AFP.
The local channel ABC showed one person being evacuated on a stretcher and a second in a wheelchair.
The airport also stated that the incident occurred around 9.30am local time (12.30pm Montreal time).
The Los Angeles Times stated that terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm on the spot if one of its staff was injured.
All flights arriving at and leaving the airport have been suspended.
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Member in Gaza
Palestinian Islamic militants died in the Israeli tank fire on Thursday, according to health sources.
A Hamas source explained that fighting started in the region after Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army simply mentioned targeted action in the area close to what the Jewish state calls a "terrorist tunnel dug at the border, the discovery of which was reported mid-October.
Report: Obama campaign considers dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Obama's close advisers secretly consider replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's highly anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the book and reported Thursday that the President's top aides conducted "extentuous group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to assess whether the removal of Biden could help boost Obama's re-election hopes.
The book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House to measure the effect of changing Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President.
The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half of the President's close advisers - including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite close personal rapport, but ultimately voted against the move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket would "materially improve Obama's odds."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
'I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them' Daley told the paper.
The President was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the campaign made significant investment in finding out whether the move would produce dividends at the polls.
Campaigns should not spend the money on polling and focus groups unless they are serious about something.
The swap is unclear, but it is unclear whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if he knew about the potential shuffle.
While Daley does not think the President was "aware" of the potential change, the former Chief of Staff admitted that it is possible that Obama was aware.
Double Down is not definitively answering the question of whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.
"Possibly," Martin replied.
Glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
The first world's first glow-in-dark ice cream is made with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of marine animal to develop the luminescent snack.
The idea was born after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced China scientists to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth, it means the more you lick it, the brighter it becomes.
The founder of "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, said: "It is incredible but still at very early production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff.
The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
As you warm up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
The glowing lotion has been testing for a few months and it seems to be a great way to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.
The most expensive ice cream I have made is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
The scoop costs around £40.
It tastes pretty good though.
Charlie’s experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese and goldleaf.
The next creation is set to be even more ambitious.
According to him, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It is essentially impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I believe we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed Dies During Tai Chi Session
Singers Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson announced in a letter published in the regional newspaper, East Hampton Star, which is intended for residents of Springs, the town where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
”He died on Sunday morning while looking at the trees and doing the famous 21st form of tai chi, with his musician hands striking the air,” wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of Chinese martial art known as tai chi.
The singer's wife also told the singer that she would get him out of hospital and take him home to their home in Springs (Long Island).
"Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
Even though we are city dwellers, this is our spiritual home.
”Lou was a prince and fighter, and I know his songs on pain and beauty in the world will fill many people with the incredible joy of life that he felt.
Lou Reed had undergone liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I am more of a sorrow.
I have not signed up for two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably will not this year.
Statistics show that I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trends.
Costumes are expected to be $1.2 billion from the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women do not have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
The men are expecting to see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feed this year.
The most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no wrong with going traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and to my surprise we were not alone.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet clothes this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.
When it comes to candy, we do not screw around.
The Nielsen Company says that Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
The total amount of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds and Clark Bars is around 600 million pounds.
The news is good news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the US Commerce Department.
In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The one thing we do not want to consume is candy corn, and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
It is about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.
It is a mystery I have yet to solve.
No one is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted homes.
The best names are "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is in an actual prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "Shock House."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States making about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts.
Finally, let's talk pumpkins.
The Great Pumpkin was introduced to us when we were children, and cutting a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we have done since we were little.
The "baby in a pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these gourds not sitting in them.
This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which harvested 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you are looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank structure to cover £38 billion (€45,000 million) of its most risk assets, a step to improve its relations with the City and accelerate its re-privatisation.
The bank is aiming to reduce the proportion of toxic assets on its books from 55% to 70% over the next two years and hopes to clean them up completely in three years.
RBS has also announced that it will be writing down a £500 million provision for the depreciation of additional bad debts for the quarter, an entry related to the setting up of the hive-off structure.
RBS has also defined that this internal restructuring would release £10 000 million in capital, strengthening its lending ability.
The bank and City have stressed that the "bad bank" would allow a break-off from past, with government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
'We can now move forward and focus on the future and on 90% of assets that make up a really good bank, and building a great bank for our clients and the UK'.
Land Rover rally series announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point harnesses, as well as an intercom system.
Options include upgraded brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support, and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "Rally customers have changed."
Their are not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure, and an accessible path to world-class events.
The path is a new way to experience different rally disciplines in the UK and overseas, and prepares entries for the rigours and realities of Rally Raid.
Defender Challenge is a really fun championship.
Additionally, the Defender Challenge will provide training and test day in February, as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and Middle East.
Emergency crews were called to rescue lost puppy after she got stuck 50ft above ground on a precarious ledge in a quarry.
Ruby had run off after she was in a minor road accident.
The dogs were spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry.
FIREfighters abseil down cliff face to pick the dog from certain death.
The puppy survived after fire crews were called to lift her to safety after she got stuck 50ft up on a cliff ledge.
Nine months old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
The owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
The family was searching for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networks after she had run into the quarry.
Then around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.
The Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseil down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.
The cliff face was right on the cliff face - 50ft from top and bottom.
She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was solid.
But she is fine now.
She was eating biscuits afterwards.
This was a very unusual call-out.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to survive.
The potential was there that she could have been very serious injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vets for a check-up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was very traumatic.
I could not believe that she was there in the first place.
It was amazing to get her back in our arms.
The vet told that if she get too tired and collapsed she probably would have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
It was really daring what they did.
We are so thankful and every single one was absolutely wonderful.
The elderly Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were scared that she might fall but she stayed there.
The firefighters were brilliant.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never hit Katy Perry when she was 18.
The pop star told an Australian radio show this week she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry shared she had dinner with the veteran rocker and that he hit on me when I was 18.
The woman added, "That was long ago, and he has been very kind.
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, says he "categorically denied that he has ever made a pass at Katy Perry."
The rep adds: "Maybe she is confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones' tour this year.
Prism is the new album she has released.
Beijing Blames Turkoman Islamic Movement
The behind-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) based in central and western Asia, according to a video posted online on Thursday evening.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Policy Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) made the statement in Tashkent while on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a senior Chinese official has named a specific organisation after the attack on Monday.
According to Chinese police, three Uighur family members from the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, which has borders with several central Asian countries, drove a car loaded with cans of petrol at the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.
The driver, his wife and mother all died in the fire in the car.
ETIM, which is fighting for independence for East Turkestan - the former name of Chinese Xinjiang - was classified by the UNO in 2002 as one of the organisations affiliated with Al-Qaida.
The movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for sporadic trouble in Xinjiang, but many experts believe it has any influence.
George Kerevan: Europe breakup gives Scots choice
Another day, another independence scare story.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free travel zone as a condition of EU membership.
Cue stories about passport control at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
The Strathclyde paper pointed to possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, but - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.
No one mentioned that the EU member States spend much time breaking their formal rules if it suits them.
Since Scotland is not in Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for what it really wanted out of the Scots.
So, a non-story then.
The one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the "independence means passport control" canard about 40 years ago.
There is an interesting point missing in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding?
Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the Euro crisis, Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - founded only this year - took nearly five million votes in September, effectively knocking the Free Democrats out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved watershed.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the strain on national economies through adhering to the common currency, has led many people to think Europe has gone too far.
The Euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was only true in Greece.
The Euro system locked its members in its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.
With no domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe is found to have a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only recourse is to reduce wage and public spending - spurred by Berlin.
Beyond current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.
The result of Brussels' green energy policy - a code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's cost - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.
The cost disadvantage is a huge cost disadvantage, as we have seen at Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not stop European petrochemical industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.
The result is revolt, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.
Berlin no longer needs Paris as a political passport and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.
Results: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the current Socialists into second place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that a split on the right will automatically favor the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
The candidate wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.
If, as very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose "Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured by General De Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.
I expect UK to distance itself from this project, aiming to cosy to the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.
Where does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.
However, we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.
I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.
Otherwise we should consider following Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most effective anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chief executive Alistair Darling and the Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing older sooner
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminence
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible for the disease.
Epidemics of obesity may be the main cause of early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is not as significant with girls as with boys.
CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter starts to grow breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?
The annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common in American girls and represent a new norm.
Parents spend a lot of time reassuring parents, but usually this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty.
Early signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing in girls.
The age of menarche has only been a slight change over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche, according to Kaplowitz.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is progressing.
The debate is on what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered precocious when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.
In most cases, the process will slow or stall, something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
More rapid progression may require further tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to prevent early menses and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bone, which ultimately leads to stunted growth and shortness as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are important.
However, Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but believes that suppressing puberty may reduce behavioral issues and girls' feelings of being different from peers.
The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply do not want their young daughters having periods.
They are concerned about pregnancy or even how they handle hygiene, Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.
Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
The first of her friends came home from school shocked and upset.
There are many well-publicised theorys about precocious puberty.
There is no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys - like girls - are getting puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity.
The study involves 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are varying explanations.
Globally, patterns of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another conundrum: Although boys get facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend to full-blown early puberty is not as significant as with girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference further defined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.
Parents need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty, according to Dr Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
It may mean having a later-than-expected conversation, Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child usually responds well.
Girls who blossom early need reassurance that even when the process occurs ahead of schedule, it is normal.
Coen Brothers' Homage to Folk Music
The Coen Brothers, winners of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic comedy set in Greenwich Village in 1961 and based on folk music, which was just budding there prior to the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has recently been reviewed at the "Cinémathèque française", took the Cannes Prix in 1991 with Barton Fink.
Since they could not hire Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary trio, Joel and Ethan Coen went with a young American movie star, Oscar Isaac, aged 33, and global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this comedy-filled film, where music is central to the story, Isaac proved himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, abandons pop for folk music with infectious delight.
Carey Mulligan, in turn, abandons the wealthy trappings of Daisy Buchanan in "The Great Gatsby" for less glitzy clothes; her voice is soft but her language is very coarse when she speaks.
Inside Llewyn Davis is a story of a week of tribulations for a folk singer who has failed to get a break and is angry with the world.
Then he refuses to accept last minute stand-in roles at studios.
With nowhere to live, he sleeps on the couch of friends who will still have him.
Documentaries style
The story is a mix of bad luck and a guy who never gets to be in the right place at the right time, not career-orientated, but honest, with a tendency to self-destruction.
The two directors, who are folk music fans, based their story on real people, such as Dave Van Ronk.
The idea was to describe the moment before the advent of Greenwich Village, the New York district destined to become the epicentre of the folk music boom that has produced international stars, according to the journalist Elijah Wald.
The film has the feel of a documentary, from the huge record label filled with unsold LPs and a priceless old secretary, to the musical choices of the studio and cafés where the singers performed.
The Coen Brothers' magic continues by integrating a comical character who is permanently on screen: a magnificent, cute ginger cat who is Llewyn Davis' companion in fate.
When asked how he developed his character, Justin Timberlake remembered how he "grow up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country music".
The first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather, who taught me to play the guitar.
Although you have to work to be considered good, luck can also launch your career.
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star says that in his career, "the most important thing is to avoid getting trapped by things that prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gerard Deilliers, "SAS" Series Author, Dies.
The word "retired" was never known.
Gerard de Villiers, a phenomenon of the French writing world, died on Thursday at 83. The author of the 200th "SAS" book, "The Kremlin Vengeance", was just published in his 200th "SAS" book, "The Kremlin Vengeance".
In February, the New York Times called him "the spy novelist who knew too much".
The latter spent ten days in Afghanistan, the setting of his famous spy novel series.
The elderly had been in poor health since having a major heart attack in December 2010, and, on this trip, he used a walking frame.
Prior to Afghanistan he travelled to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
Gerard Villiers, born on 8 August 1929 in Paris, published four SAS books every year, and asked how many books he had sold since the publication of "SAS à Istanbul", the first in the series, almost half a century ago in 1965.
"Probably 120-150 million if you include every country," he estimated last March.

Pirates are not included, he added, pointing to a pile of books on the low table, between the bronze and ivory artefacts collected from the 130 countries he surveyed for his novels.
The reader gets a book with the traditional cover, featuring a young woman with a large bosom, carrying a pistol or an assault rifle.
In his Serene Humble (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and contract agent for the CIA (to pay the repairing of his family mansion), is hot on the heels of all the world's evil-doers - communists in the 70s and 80s, then jihadists since the 90s.
The formula for each book is the same: a large dose of geopolitics and the exotics, several racy sex scenes, a touch of violence and torture.
Gerard de Villiers explained.
"I think of myself as a storyteller who writes to entertain people, not send them a message."
The work was like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert Londres, who went on location and returned with proper, lengthy investigations.
The creator of SAS said he was "making a sort of geopolitical soap opera".
Following my files (on Afghanistan, Syria etc) constantly before setting off, added de Villiers.
On location I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, and services staff, some of whom I have known for twenty or thirty years.
The result is that some of his SAS novels have been premonitory: a month before an attack on the Syrian government command centre, which killed several senior officials, he had already told the story in "The Path of Damascus".
In "The Phantoms of Benghazi", he first revealed the secret CIA command centre in Benghazi, the birthplace of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he described the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in "Caire murder scheme" a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in his book "Panique à Bamako", he mentioned columns of 4x4 jihadists sweeping the Malian capital.
"I am no seer," Gerard de Villiers would argue in his defence. "I make conjectures based on countries I know well and occasionally some of my conjectures become true."
After travelling to - often troubled - zones, he would spend a month at his 1976 IBM daisy wheel typewriter, "every part of which has been replaced".
300 pages later, he would write the words "The End" and correct each page by hand.
On the wall of his office are AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African war lords.
De villiers was regularly criticised by feminist groups for male chauvinism and by human rights organisations for racism - accusations he would dismiss in two sentences:
Some women in my books are sex objects, others are beautiful, intelligent, brave women.
I have always been well received in Africa, where I have a large number of readers.
Gerard de villiers said it himself: "Like all heroes, Malko Linge is ageless.
The Prophet will not die and not retire.
Any more I will.
Jets makers fight seat width with big orders at stake
The row has flared between leading airlines over the size of tourist-class seats on long distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.
The issue is focused on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the most frequented by airlines but which is the key to efficiency claims for the new Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would require a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its US-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute is arising as aircraft makers fight to sell ever larger versions of their twin-engined long distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.
How the back of the plane is laid - particularly if seats are 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims made for new "mini-jumbo" jet designs.
Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.
Plane giants often trade blows on technical issues through advertising in the trade press.
Now, Airbus is directly appealing to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.
The recent ad campaign reviewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide showing three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled "Would You Accept This?"
Boeing is proposing long distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props, according to Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.
The weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to US Health Department Data.
The average 21st century American male waist is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from 1950s, when the average girth of the newly called "jet set" was shorter.
Airbus has commissioned research to suggest an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' seat measurement figures and says it is not up to manufacturers to make decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.
It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the seat width.
Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver added.
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than any other person.
For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly a issue that can affect earnings.
Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the scale of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent better seat efficiency than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance claims depend on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.
The gain in unit costs is slow compared with 10-abreast now in use.
Boeing are doing this to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products, Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.
The other side of the line says full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the larger cabin, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business perspective the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777, which is threatened by the 777 threat.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to select from.
Globetrotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check competing layouts.
While boasting comfort, all builders also offer high density jets for low cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.
Since recently, Airbus was stressing more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.
With no support from the only other large modern jet makers, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.
Oracle Shareholders angry at Ellison salary
Oracle shareholders voted against the proposed remuneration package for founder and managing director Larry Ellison on Thursday, given the group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding, but it does tarnish the image of Ellison, the third richest man in the world, who is still spending his boat in the Americas Cup.
The multi-billionaire still holds 25% of his capital in the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
The last time Ellison got a negative vote on his remuneration package.
The Oracle boss relinquished $1.2 million for the 2013 financial year, which ended in May, because the group failed to meet its growth targets, but he took around $77 million from stock options.
The fixed salary is a nominal $1.
Throughout the non-calendar 2013 fiscal year, Oracle's net profit rose by 3.5%, while its share price rose 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.
Additional tests are needed before human trials start, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.
However, we are very hopeful that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the available methods today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome current methods.
New vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start producing steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralizing them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with normal activity.
The researchers believe that mice who have not been vaccinated "chill out," a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibodies levels topped that they proved expensive and unpractical.
The cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Prof Crystal believed that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they try to smoke, preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely it would be used by smokers to quit.
They will know if they start smoking again, they will not have any pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get off the habit.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned that more research was needed.
Drone Kills Pakistani Taliban Leader
The Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in an American drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, according to security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been reported several times before.
However, intelligence personnel, army staff and political activists have confirmed this time that he has died in the strike, which was carried out in North Waziristan.
Hakimullah Mehsud has been killed in a drone strike, according to a senior security official.
The previous day, the Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, informed the British government that discussions were initiated with TTP, the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi says he is not influenced by Obeid.
former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.
former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its investigation into whether Mr Obeid advised several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without tendering after their expiration in August 2005.
The investigation is now focused on allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.
The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without public tender.
Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.
The change was not made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a change in government lease policy.
The phone transcript in ICAC shows calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who was coming into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
'Was the matter discussed in these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?' Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.
No, Mr Tripodi replied.
I cannot remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn't that.
Probably not between myself and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes attack target inside Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target inside the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least two times in the past year Israel launched airstrikes on shipments of missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers on 457 visas may undergo a "genuineness test"
The "genuineness test for foreign workers on 457 visas is considered by the government as it aims to expand the crackdown.
The test, if adopted, would be applied through criteria to prevent 457s being used for unqualified posts or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia.
The government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, warning Australia's neighbors.
These loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market.
Historically, that meant it was white labour that was to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Foreign Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, with the rest under consideration.
If the "genuineness criteria was adopted, an applicant could be questioned about "whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business."
Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously small businesses aimed at sponsoring a small number of workers then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught nine-year-old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comforted since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin.
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.
The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high speed services to Scotland and north England will start soon after Phase One opens in 2026.
Parliament minister Baroness Kramer said the project would bring the UK together.
Scotland transport minister Keith Brown was "excited to work with the UK government on the plan".
Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the estimate of the high speed link between London and North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.
The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This is included the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.
Chief Baroness Kramer said "We aim for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.
It is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected by HS2.
Scotland’s Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally support Scotland's inclusion in HS2 network".
The Minister said: "High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail in Britain.
The UK Government is excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to explore options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to review the report with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps.
Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in Australia for now
Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite US moves to loosen regulations for the devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has opened the way for American carriers to change procedures to allow passengers to read e-books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight provided they remain in airplane mode.
Passengers can do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to not be able to access their e-books during take-offs and landing.
Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake massive work to meet the requirements, but have not immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also reported on the announcement but stressed that electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still restricted in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.
The issue is governed by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which has been talking to CASA about extending its inflight wi-fi entertainment system, agreed to the change but took the lead from the regulator.
They would welcome a review by CASA into allowing electronic devices to be used on our planes, because we believe it will improve the experience now that we have (wireless inflight entertainment) on our planes.
Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now.
Currently, electronic devices are not used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that policy.
The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will definitely look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.
Once an airline verify its tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes.
In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stored under seats or overhead bins during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least Four Injured in Violent Conflict
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual fever on Thursday evening.
This involves three police vehicles, two ambulances and a group of about 30 people, according to reports.
This day of Halloween, Pia had a very disturbing evening with a clash between several people around the post office.
Reports say at least four people were mildly injured.
The police, who were alerted, took the threats apart and ensure that the injured was given medical attention.
Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feels the pinch
In a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is changing a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters' school fees.
'My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money is stuck there'.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the family income is insufficient, she says.
The demand for pawnshops in southeast Asia is such that ValueMax, where she is carrying her transaction, was the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.
Jewellery pawning is not only a quick way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, almost equal to the 15.4 per cent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.
Accordingly, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as they feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow.
This week Standard & Poors, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia took the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about high consumer debt in Thailand, which last week narrowly emerged from technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.
Bottom line is that with costs rising, middle to low income people will look to supplement their income wherever they can.
The recent high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of items pawned at the city's 200 pawn outlets are gold.
People are saying "the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month.
In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
The growth in pawn business is a growing opportunity for ValueMax, which operates the Bendemeer outlet and of 15 like it in Singapore, to expand not only in Malaysia - where it has four shops - but also outside Asia.
The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.
While some discount lenders have been reported for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says pawning is a cheaper alternative to other lenders.
Consumers are buying items they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt.
There is an increasing social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing.
Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.
The rich in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can earn up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
They include wealthy individuals who need short term loans for businesses or investments, or small businesses with a need to balance their cash flow.
Occasionally they just need the money very quickly.
Minister Accused of Child Pornography in Nova Scotia
A minister who was responsible for children in Halifax, Nova Scotia has been accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning after a search at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
Timberlay Baptist Church, where he officiated as minister, was very saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said that Mr Hudgins had resigned from his position.
The minister has been temporarily released.
To be specific, he is not allowed to communicate with any under 18 or to access the Internet.
The judge will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
Nazi Clothes Chased Away from Supermarket
The man dressed in Nazi uniform with swastika armband was asked to leave a British supermarket after complaints from customers to the manager of the shop, who called the police, according to the shop on Friday.
According to a spokesperson for Asda, the complaints from customers have been very high, so we asked him to leave the shop.
The shop called the police for assistance, but "by the time they arrived he had already left without making any scene," she added.
"I was waiting for a woman who looked very upset.
People were shocked.
They do not go out in public dressed like that if you want to attract attention.
The incident occurred on Thursday - Halloween - when it is customary to dress as a monster, but it is hard to believe that this was a hoax.
The man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black SS armband in Asda twice a week for three years," claimed Paul Dutton, explaining that he was suffering from mental problems.
$325m rescue package for Tassie health
The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has strict conditions that will ensure the State Government cannot waste the money.
Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to address a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package that will address the unique challenges faced by the state, she added.
The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.
An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.
There is also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training and rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
The investments respond to ideas that frontline clinicians have told me will be the best way to tend to Tasmania's health system," she added.
The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state would have to keep current funding level in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.
Three persons will be set up to ensure the state is providing services as effectively and efficiently.
The $325 million would be little if followed by genuine reform to raise the public health system on a more sustainable footing.
The Minister however appreciated the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister in May.
'I am hopeful the federal assistance package will help to take the state's public health system off the critical list', Mr Wilkie said.
The State Government believes that these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
The federal Health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."
Why we are here is because the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system," he told ABC TV.
You cannot have a state government ripping out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth giving $300 million to claim it's good news day.
The rescue package was given to Mr Dutton to ensure that no dollar would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts exceptional production design and period detail but is also a bit longer than it should be.
The story is set in 1760s France, and is based on the tragic story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a wantonly sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an erotic object for another.
The film never goes into violence or sensationalism - and that's the problem.
The earnest solemnity of the storytelling risks making it a hair shirt-like ordeal for audiences too.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes erupted in the north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country's civil war.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the November.
The Hague-based organization for Damascus has set a deadline for destroying or rendering inoperable all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting continued in Safira, which experts say is home to chemical weapons production facilities and storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which has been monitoring the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
The report said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Also among the dead was 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, most of them foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimates that 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but no specifics.
The fight underlined the dangers of chemical weapons inspectors as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in midst of a civil war.
The statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said it has now verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment.
It added that, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
The inspectors earlier reported that they have completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.
The two locations were, according to Syria, "abandoned and the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
The facility in Safira was not immediately clear if it was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons that will be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
Congratulations to all of you for your courage and courage in fulfilling the most significant mission ever undertaken by the watchdog.
The third year of the civil war is a battle between the main Sunni Muslim rebels against the government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, a strain of Shiite Islam.
Other developments, the Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there was a strong explosion inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the blast was not known, he said.
Bali bomb plotter's sentence
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with a rash of anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, asking Umar Patek to face a firing squad.
Chief Scientist Igor Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South East Asia's most wanted, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building the explosives used in the bombing.
The prisoner can be released within 15 years if granted parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians.
The man was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The judges wanted life sentence, but they could have pushed for the man called the "Demolition Man" to be sentenced to death.
The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her two daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.
Fighting back tears, she asked Patek to be given death.
I really feel that he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
'He should be placed in front of the firing squad', Ms Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without seeing more children, and my daughters.
The Sari Club was collapsed when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated at 11pm on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives 20 seconds earlier.
The coma took a month after the bombing, and three times died while on life support.
According to Hughes, Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the murder - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody.
To keep him alive, well, there is no reason to keep him alive.
20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice.
The suspect avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"He did not give up," she added.
Then, until recently, he really didn't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people.
The verdict is coming ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
The year will be a year of tears, she added.
Patek may still appeal his sentence.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)
Passengers will be able to read, work, play games, watch movies and music - but not talk on their cellphones.
Passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Boeing Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.
The FAA has received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
Depending on the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphone, tablets and other devices once the flight doors close.
They are not supposed to start them until they reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices again as the plane descends to land and not re-start them until the plane is on ground.
The new guidelines allow airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the change.
Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we are working closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win.
We are tired of being 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.
The Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
The heavy devices such as laptops will continue to be stowed because they may cause damage if they go around the cabin.
In flight cellphone calls will continue to be prohibited.
Regulation over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
The National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national safety expert, says cell phones are still considered a risk.
However, we do know that it could interfere with navigational devices, but we do know that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they are in the air.
The industry advisory committee created by the FAA to review the issue last month recommended that the government allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., believe there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.
The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as the devices have become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate as many as three of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radios, the highly technological gadgets of their day.
New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airways have been providing Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.
Modified Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.
Among those pressing for a relaxation of the restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.
In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found no problems.
FAA Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the devices pose any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support the devices’ ability to interfere with aircraft systems, most of which are old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.
The travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.
FAA recognizes that enjoyable travel is not a guarantee of safe and security.
Birds airlifted to safety from North Sea rig released back into wild animals
A bird airlifted ashore after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig has been released into the wild.
The water rail was transported from Aberdeen last month and nursed back to health by the SPCA in Alloa.
The water rail was likely to be a winter migrant from Northern Europe who got caught in strong winds over the North Sea.
It seems the bird was exhausted and managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
It was unable to fly off again so we contacted for help.
The water rail was fit and well by the time it was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what UK's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.
Then we commissioned the most comprehensive and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders, asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representing Britain's business size, sectors and regions.
The conclusion of the poll will be unexpected to many.
The majority of businesses are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.
The British government wants to see the Government prioritise new trading links with China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's archaic institutions.
When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - most business leaders thought that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
The general discontent with the Single Market was growing, with businesses warning that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies agreed.
The most important thing, and most tellingly, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain follow a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which was reflected across the size and major business groups, shows that business is pressing for a "significant change" that brings power back to the UK.
The stakes are high - treaty change and better deal for Britain sees a 16 percent swing to stay in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should be no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership.
It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power towards the UK.
The better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a road to closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as our poll shows, for business this means renewed focus on trade and fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
United States Dress for Halloween
US President Obama celebrated Halloween.
Yesterday evening, he and his wife handed out sweets to hundreds of children invited to the Garden of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the USA were cancelled because Hurricane Sandy was on its way.
This year the Merrymakers made up for it.
In New York, thousands of people in costumes participated in the parade organized in Greenwich Village district.
"Everyone is super excited," said Andrea, one of the participants.
"I was able to wear the costume I had planned for last year."
Everyone is having wild time, added Rhonda.
People are happy.
It is relaxed, it is cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the day before All Saints' Day, mainly in English-speaking countries.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller says Bulgaria starts new gas era
South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe's most important energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.
The most important event has occurred today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large and important project in Europe.
This project is a key element of European energy security.
South Stream is aimed at adding diversity to Russia's export route through Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say.
According to Miller, direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."
South Stream gas will be available at a discounted rate once the whole project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom says construction will begin in other downstream countries by year end.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Pitcairn to Create World's Largest Marine Reserve
Pitcairn Island is aiming to build the largest marine reserve in the world, following news from Australia’s Radio Australia.
The island, which lies to the east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
The territory measures 47km2, including three small islands close to.
It has been British since its occupation by the Bounty mutineers, a episode in British maritime history that has been turned into three Hollywood films.
The population is still a few dozen, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, with 95% of their income depending on the generous support of London.
The Island Council voted almost unequivocally in favor of the creation of a marine reserve around the island, which will be 836,000km2, which is the exclusive economic zone.
The mayor’s assistant went to London to ask the UK to endorse this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that such a protected zone would be the first step towards greater financial autonomy for the island.
The project will need to be ratified by the British governor of Pitcairn, who is based in New Zealand, and the British government.
The creation of such a reserve would allow the UK to protect the 836,000km2, provided it has the means to ensure it is policed - which it does not.
There is no airport on Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircrafts there to monitor the zone, and no port where military surveillance crafts can be placed.
France, on its part, has to carry out the highly expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of 5 million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, adjacent to Pitcairn.
The FAA is easing the use of electronic gadgets on airplanes - but chatting on cellphones will still be prohibited.

The Life Sentence of Former Chinese Vice Governor
The former vice governor of Jilin province, northeast China, was sentenced to life in prison for corruption on Friday.
The former Communist Party Secretary Tian Xueren was accused of receiving 19 million yuan in bribes, according to China media officials.
In 1995 and 2001, the vice governor, who was also president of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped businesses and managers win contracts, loans and promotion in exchange for money or gifts, the Primary Intermediate Court in Beijing declared on its microblog.
Since his taking office in March, China’s President Xi Jinping has made corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon is a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
The head of state has promised that justice would be as inflexible with the powerful "tigers" as with the lesser officials, including former executives of PetroChina.
The most recent high profile case is the case of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and power abuse.
The government has not declared any intention of reforming its anti-corruption system, such as creating a independent body independent of the Party.
Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before Jonathan Lord allegations, Royal Commission hears
Two YMCA NSW employees have been charged with child sex offences before the investigation of Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.
In its opening statement to the Commission it said it had never dealt with a child sexual assault in its organisation.
Chief Executive Officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case where a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
According to Mr Hare, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.
The conclusion to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that "external audits of the YMCA have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the Commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.
According to Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, management "from myself down" failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff understood their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.
The previous year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
The man was jailed for a minimum of six years.
The latter rejected the suggestion that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lord's child safety breaches.
Staff gave evidence of breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training, told the Associated Press that she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat to be "very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of time."
The CEO said he would not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.
Their friendships with Lord clouded their decisions about reporting him.
The board agreed with him.
The decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the reports emerged was made by the YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.
The investigation was aimed at preventing contamination of evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.
The YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the Commission.
The recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff was serious.
The hearing continued until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return as Prime Minister but acknowledges that a return is unlikely.
In an interview overnight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old shared his views on domestic policies.
Since he took his leadership in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limited to foreign affairs and his role as Middle East peacemakers.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair was quoted in London's Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, sure, but it is not likely to happen is it, so..."
The crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it for Horse of the Year.
Nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The toddler and his pony Toffee took the first three rounds with ease, leading the three rounds with a victory.
The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual Pony Competition in Rudry near Cardiff.
Then he took to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, lifting his flat cap at a youthful angle and parading two-year-old Toffee around the ring.
Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills beyond his years.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given Toffee as his third birthday present last March and has practised with Toffee every day since.
The mother Donna, 30, said "Fenton and Toffee are great actors.
The two of them walked off with the gold cup and rose.
The second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so amazing they wanted to take photos with him.
The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
The whole place was electric and everyone was cheering and clapping.
The tiny monkey was running on sand across the full length of the arena and although he looked so small he did a marvellous job.
Fenton is animal mad - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he looks after.
The way he has started he will be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his horse.
The team is a great team.
The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they looked and how they presented in the show ring.
The trainers look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
Fenton was helped by his cute clothes, he really looked the part.
China plea paper to be overhauled
A Chinese newspaper that made a front page appeal for release of a defamation reporter is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Then Mr Chen appeared on television to admit that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.
New Express is now undergoing full rectification, the regulator said.
The "rectification order" came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.
The preliminary investigation shows that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about Zoomlion in September 2012 to August 2013.
New Express' editorial management was disorderly, the regulator said.
It said it had "imposed an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's license."
It also advised Yangcheng Evening News Group to completely rectify New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express's management team.
Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front page appeals for his release, claiming it supports his journalistic work.
Then Mr Chen appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money.
In this case I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn public trust.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I have realized my wrongdoing.
After Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front page apology, saying it had not properly check his report.
Several high profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.
Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in law that banned the authorities from forcing anyone to confess.
Charles deGaulle Aircraft Carrier "Unavailable"
The aircraft carrier has been left high and dry in Toulon.
The leak of radioactive steam, detected on one of the two nuclear stokeholds on the Charles-de-Gaulle in mid October when the ship was at sea, "does not pose any threat to the sailors", but is no small matter for the Navy.
The Royal Navy has signed a contract to be "unavailable until mid November" to allow time to correct the damage on the reactor.
Technical naval defence company DCNS has confirmed that its teams, along with Areva's, have been dispatched to Var department and are currently working on aircraft carrier.
Their tasks include changing a pump on the faulty stokehold.
The entire infrastructure is in place to enable the Charles-de-Gaulle to be deployed as planned at the end of 2013.
The Navy says that "this has not affected the [nuclear-powered] ship's activity schedule.
The Charles deGaulle was just returning from a six month period of interim maintenance.
It was withdrawn from Toulon in mid October for training exercises.
Qualification of new fighter pilots is mainly for the training of new fighter pilots.
The "small amount of damage", confined to the area of the reactor chamber, then occurred on the French flagship.
The Navy says the crew was not exposed to any radioactive contamination.
The overall dissatisfaction of people I meet has been very strong, with the huge revaluation of their properties, a huge tax burden, endless administrative fees, etc.
In short, the limitless stealing of money from our pockets.
Millions of dollars can be saved by introducing a tax system that is much more respectful of the taxpayers.
Taxes forcibly paid from taxpayers reduce their disposable income and contribute to their poverty.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of every major business, there is no shame about the extravagant expenditure and the maintenance of white elephants, such as the unprofitable cultural centre, the huge subsidies for the Energy City, etc.
This facility is not profitable, so it should be sold to private businesses or demolished.
It is also distressing to note the compulsory purchase of several properties to make way for a major industrial complex that never arrived.
However, I do mention the transformation of the former Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the taxpayers?
It is not up to the public purse to invest in such projects, but to the private sector based on consumer demand.
The townsfolk have been pleased to learn that the Pêche Lake and Piles Lake will continue to provide the town with water.
After the departure of all major industries (major consumers of water) and the large decline in population, water use has significantly reduced.
While this is not a threat to water, the town will never be short of water, and the severe regulation of its use may be reduced.
In a nutshell, it is easy to do great things with other people's money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this town is no longer capable of buying a pen without passing a loan bye-law.
The entire flock has been run largely by suits with marvellous qualifications. I do not believe that a sheep farmer would do any worse.
US-Mexico drug tunnel with own rail found
The most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnel between USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The four foot by three foot tunnel was described as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which goes along the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses in Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to hide drug trucks.
The tunnel was shut before any drugs entered undetected, authorities said.
authorities seized eight and half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.
Three men who worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
They face prison sentences between 10 years and life incarceration if convicted.
Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a rough 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses.
British police serve Assange with extradition notice
British police sent an extradition notice on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said they sent a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian, which would make him more at risk of arrest.
Justice Julian Assange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations, having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition.
Fearing Stockholm would pass him on to the US, he sought refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19, asking for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "served a surrender notice on a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at a date and time we choose."
The prisoner remains in breach of his bail conditions.
The Embassy declined to comment on the serving of the police notice.
According to WikiLeaks, Assange is expected to be extradited from Sweden to face possible espionage charges after releasing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website.
Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
What is the end of passwords to access a smartphone or pay for purchases?
US, French and Japanese researchers are predicting a future where we will be recognised by biometric sensors on telephones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Vice President of Morpho, believes this will be the "century of biometrics".
Biometrics will be the only way to guarantee the identity of an individual carrying out transactions in a world as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy protection organisations note this fascination with biometrics but are concerned.
In France alone in 2011, the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties authorised 774 fingerprints, hand shape or network of veins in the hand for businesses, institutions, cafeterias, etc.
Everyone will soon be identifiable, anywhere and at any time.
What is the cause of such optimism for some and pessimism for others?
Biometrics will rely on new technologies that will allow new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
In France today, the most common biometric data are fingerprints, hand geometry and the network of veins in palm or finger.
Each of these techniques has its limitations.
Examples of people working with cement have damage to their fingertips, which renders them unreadable.
Additionally, detection and verification of a network of veins or hand geometry require a voluntary and specific gesture on the part of individuals.
It is both a security mechanism - this data cannot be captured without people knowing.
As a result, research has been conducted over the past 20 years into other methods, such as face or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).
The precision of the sensors and the capacity of the computer used to analyse this data is increasing.
The accuracy of face recognition has improved tenfold over the past five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, R&D laboratory director at Accenture Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Netherlands have deployed automated passport gates that use face recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
Currently we are carrying out research into voice and gait recognition using sonic sensors, but it requires a silent environment.
DNA, a unique and unfalsifiable marker, also arouses hope and concern.
Currently, it is considered the ultimate in biometric data, according to Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Research, Innovation and forecasting at the CNIL.
DNA analysis still takes a long time and is expensive.
NEC is offering the judicial police a portable pack costing 90,000 euros that can analyse DNA samples on a crime scene in an hour.
The use of biometrics is divided into two groups: identification (recognition of one person among others) and authentication (confirmation that a person is who they say they are).
Since then, identification has been provided by identity papers, but biometric systems (fingerprints, photos, etc) will have to be given access to information that the state has on every citizen already on file.
This will provide assurance that someone is not trying to steal the identity of another.
This principle of comparison can be used for other purposes.
NEC is therefore proposing VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
”We are collecting images from surveillance cameras and comparing them with photos of celebrities that are freely available on the Internet,” explains Dany Nassif, business development director for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use is to take a photo of someone queuing in a shop, follow his progress using face recognition and work out the wait time.
Authentication initially involved physical (borders, in protected locations, in a cafeteria etc.) or digital (logging on to a computer).
Added to this, more recently, are presence checks.
'A biometric timekeeper prevents the situation where one colleague clocks in on behalf of another'.
More and more, authentication will also include transactions, especially those carried out through devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, you can now withdraw money from some cash machines by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader.
The same technique is being tested in Villeneuve d'Ascq and in Angers by Natural Security, in partnership with banks and major retailers: at the point of using a card in a shop, the customer places a finger in a reader, which scans the veins.
The experiment is expected to last six months.
If confirmation is confirmed, biometric readers could soon be seen in shops in France.
How to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to general public.
First is to explain how it can save time.
"If a customer spends thirty seconds less at a till thanks to biometrics, it would be nice," says the manager of a major store.
The second is to offer personalised services: in a few years a voice server will recognise your voice and offer you customised options.
Finally, the public can be reassured by highlighting the measures implemented to protect databases.
Physical fingerprints are stored in a primary server, and the individual identities are in a second database. The correlation between the two sets of information is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which can be locked if someone try to move it.
However, due to the lack of detailed studies, it is unclear if this line will really convince users.
Privacy protection specialists continue to be concerned.
The advances in face recognition, the increase in surveillance cameras and the huge number of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance.
Driver speeding 130mph with hot drink between legs fined £1,000
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at up to 130mph (210km/h) with hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When police stopped him they found the takeaway drink between his legs.
At Colchester Magistrate Court Howie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention.
Seven points added to his licence resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
Foreign property owner taxe to burst London's bubble
The Treasury have provisionally cost out the CGT measure but are waiting for a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 Budget introduced a 7% stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company.
The stamp duty take for residential property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber together.
Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduced anti-avoidance legislation, it is difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed without the effect of the outdated council tax system.
However, this move may make some foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell.
Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent southwest London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning domestic market, with the city's southwest, north (6.5%) and east (6.5%) all seeing a rise, according to research from Savills.
Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.
Early research revealed that happy dogs tend to sway more to the right (from the dog's perspective), while nervous dogs have a left-dominant swish.
Scientists now say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.
According to Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from Trento University, “It is well known in humans that the left and right brains are differently involved in stimuli that induce positive or negative emotions.
Here we try to look at it in other species.
According to him, as in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, researchers monitored the animals as they watched other dogs.
The dogs measured the heart rate and analysed their behaviour.
The tails of birds will not be long before we understand why they sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.
They were presented with dogs in movies - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any confounding issues, and we could doctor the tail movement and present the tail more to left or right.
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to right (from the tail-wagging dog's perspective), they remained perfectly relaxed.
Then when they saw a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's perspective), their heart rate started to pick up and they looked anxious.
Prof Vallortigara said he does not think the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he believes that they have learned from experience what moves they should and should not be concerned about.
The veterinarian added, "If you have several meetings with other dogs, and their tail wagging one way is associated with more friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience.
The researchers believe the findings could give owners, veterinarians and trainers better insight into their animal's emotions.
Veterinary behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Science, said this was not the first study to investigate left and right behaviour in canines.
The team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.
In another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he says: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was made to wag left rather than right, and become anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study.
The differences could be because the different studies did not fully interpret the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the brain is used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception.
However, considering the ease with which they can be recorded, it will likely not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way or sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness
Arctic Monkeys have postponed a Glasgow event after their lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The group are scheduled to perform at the Hydro venue in the city on Friday.
However, lead singer Alex Turner's illness has forced them to reschedule the show.
The announcement follows the cancellation of a joint performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
The Arctic Monkeys have a statement on their official website, which says: "Following the decision to postpone the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and is regretfully unable to perform."
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20 and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will now take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience this has caused.
Please contact the customer services at the box office you purchased your tickets from for any further assistance.
Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time.
Cardinals are the highest rank clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they are the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing the first group of men to be appointed to choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches 80, he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope, and this falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announce the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.
Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal elections would have declined.
The Pope usually would name as many cardinals as needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals over 80 as he wanted.
Next year’s consistency would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment there is a sort of bias to Europe and especially to Italy.
The Cardinals will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from other countries to restore balance.
Twenty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with exploring reforming the church.
In past the Pope always took everything on his own.
They have been selected to help him, Valero said.
The cardinals could be asked for advice.
It has not been in that situation before, and it is entirely new.
Cardinal Valero said Francis was "full of surprises, so we do not know who he will name."
GM recalls some new pickup trucks in the US to fix seatbacks
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from US auto safety regulators on Friday.
On some trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism.
The seatbacks do not meet federal auto safety standards on head restraints.
When the vehicle is hit from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The truck rollout began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 restructuring.
GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which tempered auto sales growth in October.
The Chevrolet and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Worker Dies Buried Under Concrete Blocks
The death of a construction worker occurred after being buried under dozens of concrete blocks in Montreal on Thursday afternoon.
The tragic event occurred around 11am on Rue Marquette, near the junction with Rue Beaubien in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
By all accounts, foundation work had been going on at the site for some time.
A shared foundation wall was recently built.
The accident occurred after the victim had arrived on site to collect his tools.
When I was driving past the site I saw the wall collapse, creating a huge cloud of dust.
"I went out and remove the large blocks that were covering him.
Only part of his back was visible, it's really sad.
The victim is a man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Attempts at resuscitation were made by the emergency services but without success.
The man died of his serious injuries.
The Occupational Health and Safety Commission was sent to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
Obama voter's sorrow
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change.
Obama has had worthy efforts blocked by GOP obstructionism.
Obstruction cannot excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a terribly sad book these days.
It is a book that I thought would lift me during the dust of second year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope.
The book is called The Audacity to Win, and it is a memoir of Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I get tired of my patient writeups at night and get to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.
The young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.
And then I close the book.
Cutting to present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of past opportunities.
Change has occurred, in the years since I cast my first ballot.
It was simply nothing I could have imagined.
I credit Obama with many and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of "don’t ask don’t tell" to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has blocked too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, public health option, and closing Guantanamo Bay base.
After many times I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I have reached a limit to the explanations I can provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor allowing drones to strike innocent children overseas.
It cannot explain the National Security Agency collecting private data on Americans, nor prosecuting whistleblowers who expose government misconduct.
It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, a American citizen, without a trial, nor for seeking public fund and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the most aggressive since the Nixon Administration.
The most recent example is the failure to design a simple website three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I do not know if this is what I should have expected.
If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
However, elective office is not a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.
The examples I have listed above seem to be of the administration's own choice.
It is what most often troubles me.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative to Romney, who could not seem to settle his policy or his position.
The hope was that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfil the hope that we have heard for so long.
Still, as Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder.
It makes me yearn for the many promises that have disappeared.
This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
"I want us to get our mojo back," he said.
We have to remember who we are.'
It is five years later, Mr. President, and I cannot agree with you more.
The opinions expressed in this comment are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
The serious accident occurred between a motorbike and a car on Rue Retinne in Fleron around 3 pm on Friday.
The motorcyclist, Jonathan, aged 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
The elderly died as a result of the head-on collision.
Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme
Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters may get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if carbon and mining taxes are axed.
The minister claimed it was only ministers who could have conflict of interest and said his daughters could personally benefit from policy.
Palmer said.
The Election Commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after recount.
Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting?
We need a better system, he added.
Why should we not have a system where you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6.30 that night?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn't like it?
In this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take it "very seriously".
Public office is about public service.
Nothing is rewarded, except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community.
The team of biologists working for the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York has identified a new humpback dolphin species living off the north coast of Australia.
The scientific mission at the Centre for Conservation and Evaluation of Marine Animals and Maritime Species (CCAM) discussed this discovery with L'Express and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Surprised you by the discovery of this new humpback dolphin species?
It's good news, but it didn't surprise me especially.
In the past, species have been described and identified on the basis of morphology, anatomy and geography. Today, the development of new tools such as genetics enhances our knowledge of the science of species classification.
Moreover, the possibility of these advances in genetics and molecular biology may challenge the classification or belonging of a species to a particular genus, family or even order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications have been questioned as a result of advances in genetics.
Likewise, two species that are very similar in morphology were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, scientists recognised two species that belong to this sub-family: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have enabled four species to be distinguished.
What is this a significant discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society says?
From a conservation perspective, genetic differences are essential to protect a species and thus its genetic variability.
Scientists have known about this population for a long time, but they did not know that it was part of a new species that only lives in this location.
In the event of large scale mortality in the region caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture, we would know that we are dealing with the extinction of a species rather than the local disappearance of a population belonging to a much broader species.
Such loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
The number of its members living on the planet, known as the stock, and the possibility of the species re-establishing itself using neighbouring stocks.
The stock of the Sousa Chinensis species, from which the newly discovered population derives, has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new marine mammal species?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This blending of genes limits the creation of new species.
The other hand, more open ecosystems favour genetic isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that marine environment is the least known of the environments.
We prefer sending robots to Mars than knowing what is living in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometres below the surface of the ocean.
More money is spent on other planets than on marine research, and it is high time things change.
RBS suspends two forex traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation.
The world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employee to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.
The ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators.
The investigation started last month, with sources close to the situation reporting that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understood to have been given leave from his current position as European Head of Spot Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramakrishna, head of European spot trading at Citi, took his leave this week, and Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
The instant message group included banker at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its staff after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at several Swiss banks.
The European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and Hong Kong Monetary Authority are investigating allegations that bankers colluded to move the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks are scouring through years' worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.
News about the probes has stunned traders in an area that has been one of the main profit drivers of investment banks' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies reduces opportunities for speculators.
The banker has tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not always true.
The senior trader added that despite the large volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks, increasing use of their internal platforms means that you can start getting a significant impact on the market at quite small ticket prices.
The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded fund desk last week after he caused a nearly $6m loss last year.
The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been cooperating with its regulators.
They are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained.
Investigation on Rob Ford Botched, Attorney Keeps It
After the police confirmed that they laid hands on a copy of a video allegedly showing Rob Ford smoking crack, Barrister Clayton Ruby maintained that he has never seen an investigation so botched.
The barrister believes the police have "ignored or downplayed evidence against the mayor."
This Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional chauffeur, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and charged him with extortion in relation to the video.
Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was frequently in contact with the mayor.
The police have also observed him delivering parcels to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Ruby says it is "inconceivable" that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his phone.
In accordance with the law, police, having seen suspicious transactions, could have intercepted Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
The could also request an immediate search warrant if this was considered necessary.
The Chief of Police has not commented. However, his spokesman, Mark Pugash, has described Ruby's statements as "a clear and desperately endeavor to sell himself to the media in a matter that is not his concern at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair stated that there was no video that could constitute a reasonable motive for the mayor's criminal charges.
European Markets, Except London, Fall in Mid-session
The major European stock markets, except London, are on a down trend in mid-session this Friday. They are being struck down by disappointing news from businesses, while Wall Street is expected to experience a rise.
Also, investors are still waiting with caution, as they believe that the American Federal Reserve may end its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
The other hand, after the announcement of a 0.7% inflation in the eurozone, the thought that the European Central Bank (ECB) may relax its monetary policy has been spreading among market players .
Futures on Wall Street are suggesting that the opening price of US shares will rise, after two consecutive sessions marked by a downward trend.
On the securities market, Renault (-4.63%) was the most significant drop with the CAC 40, weighed by the profit warning issued by its partner, Nissan Motor, on Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) reported the worst performance in the EuroFirst300, after also reporting a decline in earnings this morning and announcement of a internal bad bank structure covering £38 000 million of its highest risk assets.
Then, Vodafone (+2.45%) is still leading the uptrend in the EuroFirst300 after a press release indicating that AT&T was considering a possible takeover bid.
On the exchange market, speculation about a change in the ECB's monetary policy is rife, as testified by John Hardy, a strategy consultant at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's sole mandate has always been inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have all the reasons to take action at their meeting next week.
We are forecasting a highly likely drop in the Euro.
In this context, the Euro continues to drop compared to the US dollar and, during the session, reached a record two week low at $1.3517.
Conversely, these very speculations are boosting the eurozone bond market.
Supreme Court upholds Obama health care law
In a major victory for Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today ruled that Obama's signature health care law is constitutional.
The Justices ruled the individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the government's taxing power.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy dissented.
The court also upheld the rest of the 2700 page law, and further held that the health care law's requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding.
The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was vigorously opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates in the 2012 primary season, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.
Tribute to War Veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet Cemetery, civilians, religious and military officials, plus numerous patriotic organisations paid tribute to all soldiers and victims of every war.
flowers were laid on two of the three military burial plots in the Cemetery by Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and several other personalities.
Palestinians and Israelis fight on Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were injured on the evening of 31 October 2013 in a violent clash on the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territories for a year.
The only power plant in Gaza Strip stopped working on Friday 1 November, after exhausting its fuel reserve, the Energy Authority for the Palestinian enclave announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another officer of the Hamas armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell during an Israeli invasion of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
The two other local officers of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later found.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting surveillance operations in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and armoured bulldozer made an incursion hundred metres or so into the area before retreating.
The fight lasted for half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abou Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and added that Israeli soldiers have died in the confrontation.
Hamas praised the "Al Qassam heroes" who died defending the territory against an incursion by the Zionist occupier.
Many enemies were killed or injured during the operation.
Hamas guarantees that Gaza will be hell for the occupier," the spokesman threatened.
The Israeli army reported that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, which was discovered on 7 October and, according to the army, was intended for "terrorist activities".
Hamas has defended its use of tunnels in the fight against Israel, explaining that the purpose was to capture Israeli soldiers so they could be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military statement.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the "Tsahal forces" (the Israeli army) and injured five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
This mission was essential because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians, according to army spokesman Peter Lerner.
Additionally, Israel attacked an airbase in the north of Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday 31 October.
The US official confirmed that there was an "Israeli strike", but did not give details of the target.
In past, the targets have been missiles being transferred to Hezbollah, he added.
Officials of the Israeli government refused to confirm any information about the attack.
According to exclusive sources that it did not name, the channel reported that the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-to-air missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon, referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that is fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Early on, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions at dawn on Wednesday in a defence airbase at Sonar Jable, near Lattaquie, on the coast of Syria.
This organisation, which relies on a network of militants and medical sources, was unable to identify the origin of the explosions.
The return of Marie Chouinard to black and white is a return to black and white for Marie Chouinard, who is developing two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the ink drawings and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the piano solos of Satie's Gymnopédies.
This is an evening that shows Chouinard's entire range, from art to mannerisms and from the blackness of ink to whiteness.
The background is white screen.
The carpet is also white, in the huge space of the Maisonneuve Theatre, a body appears, in profile, as thin as a line and dressed in black.
Henri Michaux ink drawing is projected onto the screen.
The body, a simple stroke, takes its shape.
This shape is definitive of the whole piece: it is a series of physical representations of drawings.
The dancing, all dressed in black, with only their hands and faces uncovered, wait for the next graphic to appear, and then run off.
This Henri Michaux play with black and white is performed as a series of solos, in a group in unison (a mass acting as a solo), a large group of twelve solos, each individual representing their own sign.
The soundtrack is reminiscent of "Morning fever", where Chouinard performs a series of chorographic tasks drawn from cartels and lined at the front of the stage.
It is the same principle in a large PowerPoint version.
In this performance, the music is loud, accompanied by percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is great, and the rhythm is fast.
There is a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, with no sobriety or reserve, a Michaux poem, in the flat monotonous voice of an auction, then continues to dance.
The music starts again, and the sequence continues.
This sustained (if possible) discharge of sound and energy becomes deafening and numbing, and sometimes leading to deafening and numbing.
Similarly, regularity of the visual rhythm is ascribed to the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are several beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been Chouinard's strength - like the hair that is ruffled or the black fabric that extends the line.
Choreographic approach lacks composition.
The illusion is that instead of going to search for Michaux's work, the choreographer has imposed herself on it with her mannerisms.
The result is bodies that seem flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux inks, like Gestalt shapes, provide a broader and richer level of imagination than dance, more porous.
Only at the end, which is in positive, with the dancers breaking up strobe lights and becoming white symbols in a sudden dark theatre, does it touch on magic.
The audience liked it, the reception was warm.
After the interval, the Gymnopedies are richer.
The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabric, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancing takes turns to play the scores.
Their touching musical awkwardness shows real vulnerability.
Couples cross the stage as lovers, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transiting solos, moving as a group, a chorus, make the picture less binary.
Clowns are another regular feature of Chouinard's work, wearing red nose, in very polarised parades of male/female lovers.
Their loves are toothy, evasive or playful.
The body movements, the laughter, the small cries beautifully translate the archaic, the gracefulness and absurdity of coitus, of bodies melting into each other.
The piece really takes off after the bow.
A clown returns to the stage as the audience is leaving.
The fourth wall goes down, the explored universes are added, the dancers ham it up, walk through, play with the etiquette of applause, build the hype amid a consciously calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Their laughter and anxiety are Chouinard's art; contaminating the audience.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives for Samsung, Huawei and Rockstar could not be immediately contacted.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC all produce phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is a fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.
Google continued to increase its bid several times, ultimately offering $4.4 billion.
After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven by Motorola's library of patents.
Although Google lost in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.
Gesves: Faulty Water Heater Causes Explosion of House
The grandmother apparently lit a cigarette while there was a gas leak.
Following an explosion in a house in Gesves, two people were seriously injured on Friday morning - the 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson.
The expert, who was sent to the scene by the public prosecutor's office, believed that the cause of the explosion was purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a gas leak and gas build-up.
The condition of two victims remains critical.
The grandmother was thrown across the room by the explosion and very ill.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and partner, was by her side and less serious burns.
The two victims were intubated and treated for some time at the site, before being transported to the CHU in Liège by helicopter and by ambulance for the mother and her grandson respectively.
The traumatised grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
The man was unhurt and thus able to go downstairs using the staircase which was still intact, but the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door, which was weakened by the explosion, have been moved elsewhere by the social services head.
The Andenne and Namur fire department and Arches police intervened.
Crisnée civil protection services have stabilised the two buildings.
Egypt swears in first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi takes the office but his day of victory is unlikely to end political strife in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he took the oath of office to become the first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the collapse of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
The oath was taken before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.
Tomorrow is better, a new Egypt and second republic, according to Morsi.
'Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability', said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of its 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.
The gathering of the new president was limited to a brief stop to allow his motorcade to pass through the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.
The Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tyre" has grown since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate for all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
'Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state', Morsi, wearing blue business suit and red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the office.
Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.
The official welcome was made by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
The arrival of the army was greeted with a chant of, "The army and the people are one hand," from the hundreds gathered in the main lecture room.
Established in 1908 as a secular base for secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim his office from the military council that took over from the ousted leader.
The military is taking the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, in a sign that the military will continue to fight for power.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.
The shutdown in USA has slowed the automotive market.
According to figures published on Friday by manufacturers, five of the top six have recorded below expectations, the 16-day shutdown of most federal administration services suppressed growth in car sales in USA in October.
The three major manufacturers in Detroit reported double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors performed better than expected.
Analysts had forecast average sales of 15.4 million units (annualised rate, adjusted with seasonal variations), but the market ended at 15.3 million, according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's clients, he states that this slight slowdown is mainly explained by the government shutdown and its impact on consumers' feelings in the first half of the month.
However, GM has reported an increase of about 16% in sales last month with 226,402 vehicles compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group saw an improvement in their commercial performance over October 2012.
Volvo, which is still reaping benefits from its success with pick-up trucks, saw sales increase by 14% over the year to 191,985 vehicles, against an expectation of 194,301.
Then Chrysler, which is controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales with 140,083 vehicles, against an expected 143,536.
Toyota and Nissan also reported sales below expectations, despite increases of 8.8% and 14.8% over a year.
New York Stock Exchange, GM shares gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT, while Ford lost 1.1%.
Renault Share Price Plummets Following Nissan Warning
Renault saw the most significant drop on the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner, Nissan Motors, announced that it had reduced its net annual profit forecast by almost 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which was forced to make the revision, also announced a management restructuring.
Several traders reported that Renault shares were affected by the warning this morning.
The spread is clearly because of the Nissan profit warning.
Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French company's, according to data on the Nissan website.
Greece: Two Dead in Shooting near Neo-Nazi Party Office
The two people were killed and one was seriously injured on Friday evening by a motorcycle passing a office used by the neo-Nazi party, Golden Dawn, in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source has said.
The police are currently unable to give any information on the identity of the victims or any political affiliations they had.
The reports from some Greek media indicate that the victims were guarding the party's premises.
The injured person was immediately taken to hospital, the same source said.
Anti-terrorist service police rushed to the main street in Neo Iraklio, where the incident occurred, and sealed the area.
The incident occurs a few weeks after six Golden Dawn members, including the founder and founding of the party, were charged with being part of a "criminal organisation" within the context of a joint operation aimed at the party after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown Appeal Rejected
Scott Brown, Glasgow Celtic captain, has been denied his appeal and will miss his next two Champions League matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
The Scotland midfielder was sent off for a foul against Neymar in the match against FC Barcelona. UEFA has now extended his suspension to three matches.
In a press release, the club said it was "very disappointed" and that the appeal was entirely justified.
Close to 50,000 homes in the province were left without power shortly after midday on Friday, due to severe winds along the St Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides, Montérégie, and Outaouais, with 15,042, 13,464 and 8,642 customers respectively.
The metro region of Montreal is also experiencing its share of damage, with close to 7,000 homes in the city and Laval being left without power.
Thought travel agents were past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seem to be bucking the trend.
The company has upgraded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the previously forecasted $300 million to $315 million.
If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $290.4 million profit it achieved in 2011/12.
Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and started the second half strongly in Australian and UK non-business travel.
Since the start of the year, our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full year earnings before interest and tax contributions.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are typically our largest profit generators.
In Australia the leisure business rebounded during the second half of the year, offset a weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly in UK, Flight Centre's leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less.
The US business recovered its losses during its seasonally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit.
Flight Centre shares were up 3c at $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown Persons Open Fire on Hotel Near Pyramids in Cairo
unknown persons wearing hoods opened fire on a hotel close to the pyramids in Cairo, Egypt this Friday. Nobody was hurt in the incident, which appears to be a result of an argument involving redundant workers.
The attackers fled, according to the Interior Minister, Police General Abdel Latif.
The attack occurred at a time when Egypt is hardly receiving tourists since the army deposed the Islamic President, Mohamed Morsi, in early July and bloodily suppresses demonstrations by his supporters.
Schools urged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
English literature courses will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also feature unseen texts to encourage wider reading;
A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped.
From 2015, students will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo radical change.
It will make changes to core subjects next year.
In a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil a shakeup of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework.
The summer speech of Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, stressed that GCSEs needed to be more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries.
By contrast, Australia schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and students do around 138 hours in Singapore.
While there is no formal requirement to devote more time to math, Coalition sources said the extended math GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - could encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The syllabus will place a greater focus on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.
This judgement means that it will be possible to enforce a law that was adopted in this state in July and widely threatens the right to abortion.
Octogenarian in Le Muy Welcomes Children with Gun on Halloween
The minors, aged between 9 and 13, were going from door to door asking for sweets on Halloween evening.
The one of the riverside residents the children called on in the district of Le Muy opened the door with his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man told police he was afraid.
The weapon was seized.
Former Gestapo Chief Burial in Jewish Cemetery
Heinrich Muller, who disappeared after the Second World War, was actually buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel confirmed to Bild.
Muller died in the war.
The body was buried in a common grave in the Jewish Cemetery in Berlin Mitte in 1945, he confirmed in the popular daily newspaper.
This revelation comes 68 years after the fall of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime and solves one of the most important post-War mysteries.
The German Secret Service, the BND, declared in summer 1949 that Muller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were completely wrong.
"Muller's body was found in August 1945 by a commando in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich," says Mr Tuchel.
The general's uniform was a general's uniform.
Documents and photo, among other things, were found in the left pocket of the left hand pocket.
Also, Bild published a document from the borough hall of the Mitte district in Berlin, which says that he was buried in the district's Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
finding one of the most brutal Nazi sadists was buried in a Jewish cemetery is abhorrent, he said.
The memory of the victims is being trampled underfoot in the worst way," he said disgustingly in the paper.
Heinrich Muller was one of the major figures in the Third Reich never to be captured.
The Wannsee Conference in January 1942, where the "final solution" was agreed upon, and was known to be in charge of Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for the "logistics" of the Jews' extermination and who was killed in Israel in 1962.

Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend visiting hundreds of patients.
There are no doctors in West Africa, only one for every 5,000 people.
Cast your vote here or through your mobile device
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any other top 10 Heroes to be CNN Hero of the Year.
The person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
The 21 years he watched his father fall into and out of a conscious state, traveling to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in an 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.
The infection spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would last for his life.
There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, Georges Bwelle said.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.
"It is not easy," Bwelle said.
You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people can die because they are waiting.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.
If they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford it.
The average population in the country is below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's health care spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.
With poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.
Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Dr Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.
Then he became a doctor, working as vascular surgeon in Yaounde Central Hospital.
Also, he started a non-profit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.
Their luck does not always hold.
The vehicles have been driven through rivers and mud several times.
Then they receive a true hero's welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a cause for celebration, and Bwelle is more than happy to join in the fun.
Next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.
"We are getting 500 people in each trip," Bwelle said.
They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village and they are coming on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive sheep, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates.
In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.
Procedures are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.
With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a slow pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
They are playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work.
The team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group, a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has performed 700 free surgery in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.
One man explained that the free hernia surgery he received will allow him to work again.
This will change my future with my family," he added.
In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works at private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is funded by private donations.
When he sleeps, I do not know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.
The hospital is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from USA and Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a hands-on experience they would never have at home.
They have been able to scrub in on surgery where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle.
It is not something you'd ever get in America as a second year medical student.
The student volunteers usually travel on their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.
Their board, transport and instruction are covered by Bwelle.
"He is a hero, without doubt," O'Malley said.
The entire life he gives to this organization is given to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.
For Bwelle, the near-constant workload is not a hardship.
Making others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle said.
And I think about my father.
Please, he will see what I am doing.
To make people laugh, to reduce pain, that's why I do this.

Pierre Nora’s Two Frances
Academics have long been struggling to define and place Pierre Nora.
Is he a professor in lecture halls and classrooms?
Then, but with a focus on his fondness for byroads, at Sciences-Po (French Institute of Political Sciences), and Haute Etudes (School for Advanced Studies in Social Sciences).
Does he play an arbitrator of others from his office in Rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Yes, but without ignoring his less known work and underground writing as an editor.
Is he the heir to Fontenelle's chair at the French Academy?
Yes again but he knows that such a recognition cannot replace the real Holy Oil, the philosophical work he has forgotten.
The people have always recognized him as a great awakening, driving force, unifying force, but have observed that he seemed unable to produce such work himself.
The monument “Memory places” (memory places) to which his name is attached has also contributed to this unclear image.
Scandal-mongers have regarded this work as a huge flea market, presented by an intelligent and very learned commentator with a keen eye but who is a chronic "dabbler".
The two works published by Nora almost two years ago have already proven that while he appears to not write, he had written - plentifully and well.
This book should definitively do him justice.
However, once again, there is a tendency towards ubiquity, intellectual roaming, joy in jumping, as if with both feet tied, from one subject to another.
Then, one quickly understands that the various objects gathered together in this beautifully titled book lead the second-hand goods dealer to a constant passion, that of discovering the core of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic appeals for national unity?
Identity is a modern occupation.
Not long ago, we were asked to define it.
In the peremptory minds of our former leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
All it took was to highlight its mistakes and, in keeping with Jacobinism, the issue would be entrusted to the appropriate interpreters.
What Pierre Nora is searching for is something else.
The heir to a eternal Frenchness is not a heir to a eternal Frenchness; he rejects the definition.
As an analyst anxious about familiarity, he walks through a forest of symbols, stops after each step to look at an object in the form of a puzzle, tormented by irritating questions, and tormented by irritating questions.
a dramatic question, which is arising from the undertaking itself: why, in a country so permanently established within its frontiers, with such an ancient structure and so solidly built, do we hear such dramatic calls for unity?
The calls are pressing only because of the need to prevent the trouble caused by discord in French history, says Nora.
Both Gauls and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces in this country are very ancient.
The most emblematic is clearly that which divides national history into two:
The French have had two histories and two nations - one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second tried to kill off the first but failed to wipe it out; on the contrary, it was hesitant to let it rediscover its sacredness and was so eager to unity and indivisibility that it cut off the head of the person who was the visible and powerful incarnation of the two.
From there was born an invincibly bipartite nation, divided into left and right, lay and Catholic, adoration and hatred for the Revolution.
The essence of this unique aspect of the French identity is almost impossible to understand without going outside of metropolitan France, so much so that Pierre Nora's American venture could be the heart of his book.
This is because America and France have both had a revolution, drawn up a right to life declaration, and tried to build a new society.
However, our familiarity with America only highlights something that is particular to us.
There, people abandoned their former rulers in England and no longer wanted to worry about them.
Here, people were struck by an old power, and took it all the more radically.
There, the revolution was consensual, whereas here it created tragic and conflict.
There, the founding fathers are still honoured, but here, our revolutionary ancestors are rarely used as role models, and they also killed each other.
There has been institutional consistency; here there have been a torrent of constitutions, so many mistakes to correct and tests to repeat:
The France on the way out, the France in the making.
However, there has been a time when the French believed they could repair the damage done to their history and overcome the number two curse.
Since the beginning of the Republic, Pierre Nora has shown great interest and even tenderness for this Third Republic: he salutes those who tried to repair the divide created by the Revolution by teaching students about everything in former France that obscurely pave the way for the modern France, and by providing them with a unified version of their history.
This pacifically defined identity has had its day.
Here we are again, threatened by a new type of immigration, threatened by the inflow of protesting minorities, absorbed into the European framework.
The book thus offers both a fascinating portrait of France on the way out, and a detailed outline of the France in the making.
Then there is the portrait of the historian, which should leave some surprises.
It reveals that the wanderer liked to stay home.
The man of many curiosities is - slightly obsessive - focused on one idea.
The one who stood at the edge was standing in the heart of the centre.
The man who rejected a nation over half a century ago, but who escaped from the initiatory exercise of the philosophical work, believes in us, with a grain of saliva, that he has finished it after all.
And so he has, but in less formal and more exploding and subtle form.
A form, which - without mistake - is just as restrictive, as the form you use.
Because, above the university course format, this philosophical work speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
Former Hostage in Lebanon Says "Coming Back is difficult to handle"
Photographer Jean Louis Normandin was kidnapped on 08 March 1986, along with three members of his Antenne 2 team who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration, and was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
The latter retired in 2008, but in 2004 he helped set up a World Outbreak Defence Association, "World Outbreaks" which he has been running for several years.
The main goal of the association is to make it possible for prisoners to press charges and bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.
Four AQMI hostages, Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol and Marc Feret, were freed on Tuesday after being held for over 1,000 days.
Following medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have now been reunited with their families.
Now they can gradually try to re-start their lives.
The Nouvel Observateur interviewed 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, a former senior reporter who retired in 2008 and is president of the association "Otages du Monde".
The evening you were set free, you appeared on mid-evening news on Antenne 2.
What are your memories of being set free today?
On ground specifically, in Beirut?
The day I was free, I was in the boot of a car where I met Roger Auque - although I couldn't see him as it was dark.
Then he said "We are free," but I was not sure and thought we might still be killed.
We were very excited, but also very tense.
It was in the middle of a war and the people driving us were very tense.
Then they drop us off on pavement.
There were Syrian soldiers there.
Then we were taken to the Summerland Hotel where the press had gathered.
Some French men took us to the French Embassy.
The first call to my parents, family, friends, the press and so on.
I remember taking a one-hour bath, and I remember taking a one-hour bath.
Dinner in T-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night spent with Roger and Marchiani.
It was still tense as there was no way to evacuate us to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
We got there by helicopter and took a private plane to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua got on board.
How were you received when you reached French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, was there.
It was a bit rough, but it was a bit stable.
The slaughter was unbelievable.
And there was a lot of media.
When I left the country, there were three television channels - - When I left the country, there were three television channels -
When I got back there were loads of them.
The steps of the aeroplane, being reunited with my son and parents, my friends, that was all very emotional.
Numerous motorbikes followed our car, which was driven by Roussin, from the airport to my home.
The bikes were going to get in front and take photos. I had to do some patrols to stop some of them climbing up.
The media pressure was huge.
It would not stop and we were well placed to know that...
The level of emotion and fatigue made it difficult to think clearly.
You get out of a hole and suddenly become the spotlight of the media.
It is a bit complicated, a bit of shock, quite difficult to handle.
The hardest part was going on.
I was on the mid-evening news that same evening, and on TV the following day.
Then a very gentle re-adjust to life started, lasting one or two months.
How did the medical examination and debriefing with the DGSE (General Directorate for External Security) go?
I had to go to Corsica for initial medical check.
The other tests were carried out in Val-de-Grâce in the days after my return: X-rays, examinations of every type, and an appointment with a psychiatrist.
Everything cannot be resolved in one appointment, but you know you have not been abandoned to yourself.
It is all part of the process.
I also meet with the Intelligence Services.
The prisoners asked me many questions about the prisoners.
It was normal.
It did not bother me.
How do you react today to the release of four prisoners in Niger?
I am listening to what is being said.
Specially the debate about ransoms.
Some things annoy me, others less so.
I try to distinguish between the questions about my past as a hostage and my role as president of the World Otages Association, which allows me to keep distance and seems to be more interesting to deal with.
Examples of resilience are defined as a resilient person.
And I fight, alongside other people, for the legal status of prisoners.
I think there is a problem of semantics.
Political hostage-taking is almost always defined as political hostage-taking, and allow the prisoners to access justice, to press charges and to bring them before the International Criminal Court.
Today, everyone is filled with compassion, emotion and is rejoicing that the prisoners are free.
What is the claim that the prisoners may also have access to justice?
The Hague court has been set up for that purpose.
Why should we not say to the hostage takings: "You have broken the rules of war and all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice".
I think that is justified, legitimate, plain common sense.
People hear the message but do not listen, and that shocks me.
It is my main struggle.
Egyptian Islamists Take to Streets to Denounce Morsi Trial
Fear is brewing in the ranks of Egypt's Islamists.
Two days before the start of the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi, people took to the street.
The demonstrations have been spreading throughout Egypt to demand the reinstatement of the country's first democratically elected president.
It is not a trial, says one Muslim Brotherhood activist.
"He has not seen a lawyer and no volunteer has been able to get a copy of the case documents.
It is not a trial, it is a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a fake trial, says a angry Morsi supporter.
Morsi should try Sisi for the mass murders of Rabaa, Nahda and the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Conflicts broke out in Alexandria, where the police used tear gas and 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police troops were deployed in front of the Police Academy in Cairo, where Mohamed Morsi will be trialed.
Hagel Accuses 9 US States of Violating Human Rights
Since the Federal government recognised same-sex marriage, all spouses of military officers have a right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and to the associated benefits.
However, some states have refused to issue these cards to same sex spouses in National Guard facilities set up in their region, which he called a "violation of federal law and equality.
With no cards, such individuals cannot access many social or health services in these bases, or access the shops of the latter.
The Secretary of Defense has ordered the Head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that federal law was implemented.
The first state to reject these measures was Texas, which refused to implement them in Texas National Guard facilities due to a conflict between Texas law and federal law on same-sex marriage.
Indianapolis, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia followed by rejection, according to a senior Defense official.
The Pentagon estimates that the population concerned by the recognition of same-sex marriage involves about 5,600 active individuals, or 17,000 if the National Guard, the Reserve and retired people are included.

Toronto Mayor Chases Journalists for Interviewing him on Drug Affair
In Canada, the Toronto Mayor is suspected of using drugs, according to several media sources.
A video sent to the authorities seems to support these suspicions.
The man involved, Rob Ford, has always denied taking crack, but has admitted to being partial to cannabis.
This Thursday he drove a number of journalists off his property when they came to interview him.
We also think that sometimes pictures need no explanation or comment.
Rabies Detected in Cat in Val d'Oise
Officials announced on Thursday 31 October that a rabies case was detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, France.
The kitten was found in Argenteuil on 25 October and died on 28 October.
Rabies diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
Epidemiological investigation was initiated to identify and treat any individuals who may have come into contact with the kitten between 08 to 28 October inclusive.
Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have been identified and have received preventive treatment.
Human rabies treatment administered after contact with the carrier animal but before symptoms appear is very effective.
The ministries are currently asking anyone who may have bites, claws, scratches or bites on mucous membranes or on damaged skin by the kitten, or who have an animal that may have been in contact with the kitten between 08 to 28 October to contact them on 08 11 00 06 95 between 10am and 6pm from 01 November.
Since 2001, France has been clear of rabies since 2001. This kitten or mother was imported from another country where it still exists.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded 'native' case of rabies was in December 1998 in a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in November 2001.
Rabies in a bitch illegally imported from the Gambia was recorded in 2008.
Rabies is a fatal disease if not treated promptly, and it can be transmitted during the fortnight or so before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama Health Care Walk Back
Following a slew of criticism, President Obama walked back to his once-repeated, unambiguous promise that if you like your health plan, you can keep it.
With hundreds of thousands of notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president for misleading the American public.
Today, Obama changed his original pledge.
”For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Following what he called the "flurry in the news about the cancellations, Obama advised Americans to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.
Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same or even cheaper price than expected.
"You are going to get better deal," he said.
The administration has said it should not be surprised if the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
Please directly tell these Americans: you deserve better.
According to Sebelius, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has been miserable since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as anybody," she said.
I am eager to earn your trust back.
The phrase was uttered by a hot mic to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing after a debate with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.
More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius on why the "architect of the Affordable Care Act" has not voluntarily abandoned government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans.
Vettel Uses New Special Helmet in Abu Dhabi
Lucky winner Jake Vite Prekop combined the colours of the brand and the German flag, while integrating speed and heat on the track.
Deutsche driver Sebastian Vettel, quadruple World Champion, wore a special new helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan during the free practice sessions for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday.
Vettel chose the winning entry from 1,500 designs sent in from all over the world as part of a competition run by one of his sponsors, a car brand in his stable.
The winner was invited to the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi with a friend and was able to get close to the German champion both on the track and in the pits.
Vettel was expected to wear the helm in practice sessions on Friday and Saturday.
The athlete will likely have another special helmet for the race on Sunday to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
Aubervilliers Resident Launches "Banlieue Party"
Make no mistake, always.
The Neighborhood Party is not only targeting urban residents.
"I chose a map of France as the logo," he says.
When I talk about suburbs, I am referring to all those who feel excluded from the national family.
The project, which was presented at a press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers on Thursday, was born from a desire to better defend multiculturalism - the great cultural melting pot that, above all else, characterizes these districts.
”My main proposal is to create a Multiculturalism Ministry,” he says.
AbdelMalik Djermoune, a 50-year-old regional attaché, claims to be "100% apolitical", although he has never been neutral.
The activist supporter of Jean-Pierre Chevénement in 2002, he later supported Dominique de Villepin in the district from 2010 to 2011.
However, I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my manifesto are associated with the left, but if people on the right are prepared to support me, I will listen to them too.
"It is only extremist parties that I will not talk to."
Beyond multiculturalism, Abdel Malik Djermoune has built his manifesto around several subjects aimed at appealing to urban residents, especially young people: the right to vote for foreigners, legalisation of cannabis, lowering the voting age to 16, restoration of caretaker functions, etc.
The candidate list is still being formed and defending his ideas in the political arena.
"Time and money is the problem.
However, the 'Banlieu' party should at least be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and in other towns too I hope.
Abdel Malik Djermoune claims there are already seven names on the candidates list in mainland France and in Martinique.
However, the mail expressing support that I have been receiving since yesterday is not all from the suburbs, he says.
John Kerry says US spying has "reached too far inappropriately" in unprecedented admission
John Kerry has signalled a softening of the US defensive stance on its surveillance programs, adding that on occasion it has "reached too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with President Obama, of being on an automatic pilot as shocking revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.
The leaks have placed the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
According to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I have learned about some things that have been happening on an automatic pilot since World War Two and to the difficult years of the Cold War and then 9/11.
Then he became the first highly ranked member of the US government to admit that US spying had crossed the line but emphasised that no one's rights were abused.
In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately.
The President is determined to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review to ensure nobody will have a sense of abuse.
I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA was a good force and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives.
The spokesman added: "We are dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we have been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut has spoken with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of surveillance by the National Security Agency.
Murphy, a first term Republican and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I am going to Europe to make clear to them that we need to continue working together in combating terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.
Reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, but the agency's head said they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored Germany's Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.
The National Intelligence Director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it is commonplace on both sides.
Murphy said his office is preparing the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include both parties and both chambers.
Other participating lawmakers were to be released in the coming days.
The itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to improve relationships, he also said some "tough love" will also be dispensed.
The European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they have used for years.
While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the Europeans, they also need to accept that we are not the only ones out there spying.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to travel to Middle East and Poland to address rancor over US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed on Thursday, with prices lowered by poor results from Shell on the day after an announcement by the Fed that it would continue to support the economy as planned.
Australia woman appeals Thai jail time
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraint her, carried out the assault on Sunday June 10.
However, CCTV footage later revealed she was safely returning to her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in an adult women's jail.
The daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks has applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that his family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's health and wanted her back to Australia.
'It's a very anxious time but we're very hopeful to have her safely home safely as soon as possible' Tunks said.
Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports in Australia said that she was holidaying in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
sources in Thailand said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also look to repair its damaged tourist image, leading to acquittal.
French Police to Arrest Anderlecht Supporters Not Traveling in RSCA Buses
The French police have decided to impose strict rules ahead of the match between Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht and Paris Saint-Germain, set for Thursday, Marie Verbeke, spokeswoman for the Brussels-South police district, said on Friday.
RSCA supporters who want to travel to the Champions League match will have to use the transport system provided by RSCA.
The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former frontier post at Rekem to the PSG stadium, according to the spokesman.
The arrangement will be the same on the way back.
While other supporters are intending to travel to Paris by other means, the French Police Department has announced that steps have been taken to allow arrests and people to be taken into custody.
Working together in French is the challenge of the Margerite-Bourgeoys School Board (Margret Bourgeoys School Board).
Margerite-Bourgeoys School Board has 62% of students who have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what inspired a consultation exercise between parents, students, teachers and staff of the education department a year ago to reflect on ways to improve integration of students with roots in several cultures.
The School Board has just announced its vision of "Living Together in French".
The organisation, called Vision Diversité, has been visiting schools for the past year to help students of every origin find common reference points that are not limited to the French language.
Discovering neighbourhoods, our architecture, our environment are reference points.
As are the names of great writers and artists, whether they are of French origin or from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
Because of that, we are developing projects that can identify with all of that, explains Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the New World Institute (New World Institute) has identified several challenges for the School Board.
Sharing what Quebec culture is, for example, the sense of belonging, support for people going through the changes we are experiencing in the student body, he lists.
The Margerite-Bourgeoys School Board has created a research centre that will provide tools for teachers, who, sometimes, come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz from University of Montreal will be the scientific director.
Preparedness to manage a class in North American and Quebec context.
The real need is for different educational strategies, she says.
The research will address inclusion from every angle: linguistic, educational, social and cultural.
