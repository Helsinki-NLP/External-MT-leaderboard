The European Union is the world's largest consumer of food.
The main reason for the rise in inflation in the eurozone was the rapid rise in food prices.
The 13 eurozone countries recorded higher than expected inflation in November, with annual inflation of 3.1% after the 2.6% in October, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered its policy rate, as it believes that the lowering of interest rates, the rising commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment would encourage the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB is committed to keeping inflation below or at least close to 2%.
One analyst said the ECB was in a bind: it had to "negotiate" inflation to avoid any need for action later.
Germany's inflation rate reached a 12-year high of 3.3 percent in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
The increase in food and energy prices is responsible for the increase in inflation in the eurozone.
MATIF wheat quotations rose 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Considerable increases in the price of cooking oil and dairy products were also recorded in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil has risen 52 percent this year - last month the price of a barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
The ECB expects inflation to rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but forecasts a decline to 1.9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect inflation to be 3%, but estimate the annual average rate at 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup report on the government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz supporters has grown significantly by the beginning of December, with the party having the largest base camp for the first time since 2002, while the support for the Socialists has reached an all-time low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference between the party-oriented voters is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71%) support the MSZP compared to one fifth (20%).
The MDF and SZDSZ are, according to the survey, below the parliamentary entry barrier: they account for two per cent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "somewhat bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to worsen further, with only one in ten expecting an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historic high - rated the prime minister's work as "more bad than good".
Thirteen percent of those surveyed have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% who distrust the leader of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that the discontent with the Prime Minister can be controlled without a change of government.
The number of people who still support the government and the head of government after the unrest last October is down from 35% to only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) see the solution in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent said they would "certainly" participate, and another 20 percent said they would "probably" vote.
For comparison: if the parliamentary elections were held on this Sunday, only 55% would "certainly" go to the polls, another 15% consider their participation "probable".
74% would oppose tuition, 79% would oppose the practice fee, and 84% would oppose the hospital stipend.
The proportion of those who opposed the study, practice and hospital fees would be as high as 81.84% and 89% respectively.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs shopping district have maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budapest shopping triangle, the price of the Napi Christmas basket has increased by 16 percent this year, but all the hypermarkets have registered price increases of over HUF 1,000.
After the "de-alopement" of food prices last December, the percentage of inflation has not changed drastically compared to the previous high starting point.
However, consumers are certainly discouraged by the fact that what they paid far less than HUF 9 000 for last year is not available this year for even HUF 10 000.
The price of the 'Napi' basket exceeded the HUF 10,000 magic mark by at least HUF 91 in the markets examined.
The highest price was HUF 10.573.
(In 6800 the price was HUF 6800.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as in the previous year, but there was a sharp rise in the prices of breast-fed fillets, nuts and poppy.
The prices of flour and bread were in line with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but Auchan had 1 kg of bread for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop below HUF 200 for the product.
Also surprising was the price of a two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola for under 200 forints, so the drink cost only 257 forints, including the deposit.
However, this year's "Napi" shopping cart comparison showed Auchan as the most expensive and Cora as the least expensive.
Our calculations show that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 percent over last year's Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased their prices by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest basket of goods of the previous year and the most expensive basket of goods of the current year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket of goods of the previous year and the most expensive basket of goods of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1 480.00.
The average price increase was still 1,206.00 forints in the previous year, but the VAT increase in prices was noticeable at Christmas.
This is precisely the case with trade: it seems that the department stores were not able to decide which price range to apply to each item, since the effects of price increases on consumer behaviour were unpredictable.
(If the trader is not planning the speed of a product, he may lose substantial profits in the price range which depends on the traffic intensity.)
The price of the 'Napi' basket was so drastically increased last year due to the value-added tax that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket costed 1,630.00 forints more than the previous year, and even the cheapest had a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, the price increase has been catastrophic, with the price of everyday consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office found an increase in price of more than 30% over a 12-month period.
The same applies to flour and eggs.)
However, if you look at the "Napi" basket, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the already expensive product has risen by only 10 percent in the worst case, even in the previous year.
The flour suppliers are obviously in a stronger position than the oil suppliers - after all, they were able to pass on the drastic price increase to the multinationals.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; there are constant reports of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores do not even look at the prices anymore.
It is not just the food that is being bought, but also the food that is being sold.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless lines at the checkout counter in all three department stores, when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, the country reports lower customer frequency, so many multinationals complain to pollsters that they cannot even achieve the planned turnover, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand hospital-acquired infections have been reported as a result of improper use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowded beds, overworking staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the control of infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, too, there are savings in the use of disinfectants.
The trauma department at János Hospital was recently diagnosed with an MRSA infection.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was found in a male patient who was admitted to hospital after a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
There was a similar infection earlier this year.
The man was released from the hospital after a serious car accident, but he was returned with an MRSA infection, and an important operation has not been performed because of the bacteria still in the patient's body.
As of December 10, 1094 infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System from hospitals, according to Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
So, this is how many multi-drug resistant infections have been reported in hospitals, but the number of cases that have been reported in the dark is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria is carried in the noses of about one third of the population without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as strep throat, tonsillitis, skin infections or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics and are easily curable.
However, if the drugs are overdosed or used improperly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria develop from the well-responsive bacteria and spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
These bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infections or blood poisoning, sepsis, particularly in patients with weakened or permanently malfunctioning immune systems, but also in the elderly or low-weight patients.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is not unusual, such incidents are part of the hospital's daily routine.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is only absent where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks when they provide care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment", says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are tested for MRSA when they are admitted to hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of MRSA-related infections in hospitals are preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are not conducive to containing the emergence or spread of the multidrug-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is predominantly found in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine patients who are admitted and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not so common in Hungarian hospitals.
The reason is that the State Health Insurance Fund does not provide any funding for this study.
Most cases, therefore, would not come to light until the patient had a detectable MRSA infection, says the medical director of the Epidemiology Center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but Hungary also has guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy is supposed to be targeted, that is, microbiological testing is necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but hospitals do not always follow this directive.
Among outpatients or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even less common, says Karolina Böröcz.
The savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by healthcare workers.
This is why handwashing, or the wearing of gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but local hospitals are not always able to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are close together, even though epidemiologically, there should be at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz continues, unfortunately, in hospitals with less financial resources, there are even cases of waste in the use of disinfectants, few nurses, many patients - all factors that can actually contribute to the development of infections.
Such infections are far less frequent, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections are a huge cost to health insurance companies to manage, so they're being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was included in the government programme.
The programme is showing initial signs of success - published data show a declining trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
The chief of police was not drunk.
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired police chief of the 22nd district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither intoxicated nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for the Budapest High State Prosecutor's Office, on Friday, after the official report on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the findings of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The former police chief, with his own car in the 22nd district, drove into Kossuth Lajos Street, and in the process, he hit a 55-year-old man who was crossing the street at an unmarked point.
(According to the StVO, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the driver has the right to drive, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra crossing.)
The pedestrian succumbed to his injuries after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a concussion, then resigned from his duties and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into the incident.
Moreover, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three loan agreements worth a total of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday, with the money to be used for education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million facility in 2006 to finance transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund.The loan agreement of EUR 100 million was signed earlier, while the current agreement covers the use of the EUR 200 million loan.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be used for the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has committed a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose, with the use of the remaining EUR 150 million to be decided upon later in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contract partners have signed an agreement for more than EUR 50 million, which will be mainly used for research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the 4 line subway.
It was agreed that once Hungary had clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications would be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary, with a total value of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rates are EURIBOR-linked and the loan is made available by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all Europe is looking at the once-rarely-mentioned Balkan state.
What, where and who are buying in the EU's cheapest market, which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
The analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Bulgaria is currently without doubt the most sought-after place to buy property in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, along the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the Renners, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik is also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country is also attracting investors sooner or later, e.g. Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the very good area of Russe is also seeing more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, attracting tourists in both the summer and winter seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in large numbers, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying property in Bulgaria also aim to change their lifestyle.
Most of the buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while the Black Sea and ski areas are dominated by Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down either buy revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or dilapidated houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility, as well as communication opportunities, are highlighted, but proximity to a major city, shops and doctors are also crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those looking for holiday homes (Bulgaria was listed in December as one of the top ten holiday destinations for Germans).
The third group is made up of businessmen who invest with the aim of achieving medium to long-term value growth.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming increasingly expensive, driven by ever-increasing demand.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the EU, it has seen an annual increase of 21% over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out measures to reduce emissions beyond 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol expires.
There is a heated debate going on between the industrialized and the developing countries.
The US has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but it is prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are prepared to support the developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on assistance to developing countries was also reached.
The Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund is to be administered by a 16-member Council, presumably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as indicated in the 'Piac és Profit'.
Unemployment rate
The Minister for the Environment, Mr Gábor Fodor, supported the EU's ambition to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (at 1990 levels), regardless of whether the post-2012 agreement is successful or not, and that the Union would even be prepared to commit to a 30% reduction if other major industrial countries and developing countries were also prepared to meet their commitments with strength and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU, with its then 15 Member States, had already committed to a minus of 8%.
The Hungarian target is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a target which the country will certainly meet, according to the press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012 - in which case the Kyoto Protocol reduction targets would not be followed by a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific committee on climate change awarded the Nobel Peace Prize by the UN in its latest report.
This would delay the emission reduction and would make the increase in the Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C unavoidable, with extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
The British Army is advertising on YouTube
British Army units have posted footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video portal to increase popularity.
The British Royal Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube: Special Forces based in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The footage, shot with miniature cameras attached to helmets, is checked at Kandahar Air Base and then sent to London, where it is posted on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed over 75,000 times.
The UK Ministry of Defence was registered under Defenceheadquarters in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the UK Foreign Office and the International Peace Fighters (MNFI) in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Deployed in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally posted the videos with the goal of recruiting soldiers, and as the Department of Defense says, the posts also serve the purpose of informing the public about the true goals of foreign operations.
Such propaganda is almost free of charge compared to traditional TV ads, according to defence expert Gordon Mackenzie, but the videos always carry a political message, as they validate the military action taken by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with play
The army also has to fight against amateur images that are uploaded to the Internet alongside carefully edited, censored images - such as those showing the death of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical "official" propaganda films, the losses are talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Incidentally, many videos from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genre" for themselves.
The Americans, however, are advertising in a somewhat different way, with the free-to-download shooter "America's Army", in which the player can assume the role of a soldier in a more or less realistic simulation.
Christmas Party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is not being coy: instead of a Christmas party, she is hosting a work conference where her staff can celebrate the end of 2007 with coffee and Pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others create a Christmas mood with raffle or a shock to the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
Christmas fever has already spread to the offices.
The biggest Christmas party of any Ministry will be held this year at the Defence Centre, but no Ministry staff are expected to attend.
The "Christmas party for the orphans" is a gift for children of fallen soldiers, the "mission party" is a welcome for family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The Treasury is providing some 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other ministries, the National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are the most successful.
The 4.32 million forint Christmas party of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected to attend.
The focus of the festivities will be Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Development Agency (NDA) held its 4.7 million HUF Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the OIT building, with concerts and a banquet.
The total amount of the meal was 1 million forints, the rest being spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
We have information that a department of the NFU is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG Zrt) with EU funds.
The building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented for the celebration.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information as we have not reached the authorities.
What's with the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to guests of the NFÜ but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball there on 7 December instead of a Christmas party.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 people came to the ball.
The ceremony was opened with a speech by the Minister, and after dinner there was live music for dancing.
At the request of [origo] it was announced that there was no dress code at the ball.
The ministries of health, labor, and local government are each preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health is hosting the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 forints.
The Minister of Labour, Mónika Lamperth, invites her colleagues not to a Christmas party but to a conference on the theme of the year.
The press office said that the event would cost 350,000 forints, with about 180 guests expected to be served only coffee and snacks.
Local government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is hosting a Christmas party in its own ballroom, which is expected to attract 436 employees.
The expenditure was estimated at 2,500 forints per head - at this price there is a buffet reception followed by a boost.
Since the beginning of János Veres's term of office, the employees of the PM celebrate in this way every year.
There will be no real party atmosphere, however, not only because of the official speech by the Minister but also because the celebration is scheduled for this afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture is inviting you to a New Year's reception on January 20th, the Ministry's Christmas celebration is off this time.
The hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Palace in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the department, the expenses are limited to 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a short address by the Minister and end with a restrained banquet.
According to the corresponding press offices on request, there will be no Christmas party at either the Foreign or the Education Ministry.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not give any information.
At any rate, more than 400 guests have been invited to the celebration, which is being held at the Museum of Arts and Crafts.
More and more forces are mobilized for the giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordination committee for the indefinite strike starting on Monday on Friday.
On Saturday, a protest meeting will be held, and on Monday - the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - the work stoppage will begin.
The strike is expected to cause significant disruption to transport, with almost all railway services being shut down, and the Budapest public transport (BKV) will also be on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the Monday strike will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee is also being set up to coordinate Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, and starting Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will suspend their work indefinitely, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law, was not defined.
If the National Council does not approve the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees meet to discuss the next steps.
Given the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that the vote on the health insurance law will take place later in the evening, or even at midnight.
The strike, which will begin on Monday, will cause considerable disruption of transport: the railway workers will stop work indefinitely, most public transport will be closed in the morning and more than half of the Volán companies will be closed.
At the same time, there will be one-way highway blockades in many places.
The call for strike action has been followed by many trade unions and civil society organisations - the list of participants is updated on the League's website.
Some organisations announced strikes for an indefinite period, others planned temporary stoppages.
The Hungarian Railways MÁV and the Free Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ were still unable to reach an agreement on adequate services by Thursday afternoon, despite the fact that more and more people are travelling by train, especially around Christmas.
According to reports so far, the BKV is on strike from the start of work until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy are on strike for four hours, and the teachers' union and the Democratic teachers' union have called for 2- and 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association stages a nationwide strike at different times, and the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of Trade Unions, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and put forward a new conception for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the phased introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due next year.
The third requirement is that the early retirement scheme should be open to the eligible occupational groups before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which is part of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport on the secondary lines and is now calling for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded in August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's 'Risk Warning Report' states, among other things, that the highest political risk associated with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is the 'exacerbation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term'.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
This is reported as a failure on the part of the political authorities: "public figures have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups, who have now based their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contrast".
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremism, and increase the likelihood of violent conflict.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least because of the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, have "damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: since autumn 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "National Self-Defense Association" were founded.
"These groups have in common that they define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly boast of preparing their members for defense tasks (catastrophic protection, national defense, law enforcement), sometimes armed, citing the unfitness of the police, the army, or the state itself", it said.
And further: All this is happening according to the method which attempts to disguise various political aspirations as a civic initiative, based on the political and party loyalty of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the association form is therefore not only intended to circumvent legal obstacles that might arise in the course of registration with the courts - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also represent a risky factor for relations with neighbouring states.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, with some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries seeing in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policies.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region", it said.
In the view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, and the political risk has therefore grown for the whole region.
The Hungarian Guard's activities are reportedly comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard was the mass Roma riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has used the incidents as a reason to establish the National Guard, arguing that the purpose of the organization is "national protection".
In her opinion, the past 17 years have seen a veritable "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - so Political Capital.
The initiative would have sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As mentioned, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced the creation of their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the Risk Warning Report by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and, if risk-changing trends are apparent, the public would be informed, as in the case of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of rescheduling working days around holidays has now become established, but next year we will have fewer such days.
The European Union and the United States also have a different understanding of the term "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
The days of rest are usually religious holidays or are connected with important historical events.
For example, we celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new are days off from work - the latter just so that New Year's celebrants can rest.
In the whole year we have fourteen holidays in all.
The state holidays are March 15, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, the anniversary of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st, we celebrate the work, and on November 1st and 2nd, we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "work day shifting" has proven to be effective in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very hard or go to school on the Saturdays before.
The date on which the day of the holiday, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be worked off has been fixed for many years by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The law applies to all employers and employees, as well as to public employees and civil servants.
The only exceptions are those in which the work is carried out without interruption, including holidays.
The only thing that disturbs the working order this year is the holiday season at the end of the year: after 24 December, life in this country is virtually halted, as most people take the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve to make up for lost time, or take the holidays set aside for this purpose.
The next year will have more weekends and holidays, so there will be less change of working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the working day so that people can stay home for four days in a row.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a day of rest.
The second change is linked to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, work will have to be done before Friday 24 October.
The end of the year will, however, be entirely marked by holidays, as from 24 December everything will be laid to rest, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six intimidating little things to annoy coworkers
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive - harmless lies we never notice: they bring "color" to the everyday workplace.
The question is simply whether you get used to these small inconveniences or whether you rise to the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstood, annoying situations.
I'll give you a tip.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called", says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it up to them, perhaps by calling the marketing department and remorsefully admitting that you forgot to post the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, an apology is a done deal.
Before you get into embarrassing excuses, think about how you can make your colleagues feel uncomfortable and try to avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more nerve-racking than reaching for a document, office supplies, or the phone, and it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
You should not borrow from your colleagues without asking, for they are rightly upset when they find that something has been taken.
So don't put envelopes or post-its from the office in your pocket, because it might hit you: there's none left if you need it badly.
Gossiping about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a rumor that has already been put out into the world.
Who did what with who?
Where and why?
Information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues should not be passed on to everyone!
And when someone opens up and reveals his innermost secrets, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to keep silent like a grave rather than to address those who are not present, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
You called in sick for no reason?
If you call the office to report a nagging headache, because you are feeling uncomfortable or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unforgettable tasks, projects with fixed deadlines must now be completed by colleagues instead of by yourself.
So don't play hard to get with the guys!
If you know the day before that you won't make it to the office the next day, or that something might happen that requires you to stay home, you should report it in time so that neither your colleagues nor your boss will be unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
The whole of the European Union is a single market.
You are absorbed in your work, but are suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of your female colleagues?
Did you overhear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
Do not annoy your colleagues with humming, singing, loud conversations (which you carry over their heads), trampling, constant name-calling or nagging.
All of this can be very distracting, even if they're not really focused on one task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other guy's fault?
If you have missed a project, forgotten to send an important letter, or forgotten to send important information, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
If possible, avoid using the office chaos or the noisy colleagues as an excuse!
The best thing to do is to admit your mistake and apologize if it has affected others.
The question of how to make up for the mistake or the oversight is all too appropriate!
At the office - a feeling of home?
Pants and flaps: comfortable for home, but has nothing to lose in the office!
Even then, you should not dress casually, even if the workplace allows it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if you want, even pretty and elegant!
Wanting to be right for everyone - or how to be uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody comes from the radio: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, the bass is added to the previous sounds, and a female choir is added as a real sounding gem.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which is on mr2.
The local music scene hasn't been treating us to quality electropop for a long time.
But now you can see the traffic jams in a different way when you listen to Zagar's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, as well as other new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene, are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if garage rock with its guitar-like sound is back in, the local electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, playing in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a pub can't hold two pipes - started to make his own way.
He made his breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, but only when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
The first of these is the "Sezon" by Ferenc Török).
The band, which had originally been formed in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, almost single, also in the West marketable trendsetters.
No doubt Zagar and his band were trendy, but no one cared if they liked wearing that brand.
The band responded as they should have, with a new, even better album.
The new album, "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", could open up new avenues for them, but the title itself expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but the ethereal character of the music is not matched by the more vocal guitar, the rock and roll influences, which are in keeping with the spirit of the times and the trends.
With these songs, György Ligeti, a singer living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in the Millennium.
One song from the album has even become a radio hit - the most recent Mr2 Petőfi, who has been broadcasting pop music from early to late, has successively put the earworm on the listener with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
All right then .
The hvg.hu has asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music remain reserved for a certain class?
Balázs Zságer: The term "slam music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two casts in pop music, and that's not mainstream and underground or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but it can also be produced only for sale, making it commercial music.
Even a good pop song can be born of an honest motive.
The listener's receptivity also works on this principle, regardless of language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
For example: abroad, especially in the West, pop music has a larger tradition.
It's not just teenagers or twins going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively because they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hv.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people hear your music?
For example: Of course, it's a good feeling to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
We never wrote for the market.
We don't make music to serve a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is mostly felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that exists only in the intangible changes of the moment.
But I've noticed that if you try to please everyone, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's a soloist on tour, and he's made his career in the West.
B.S.: We don't really follow his path, except for the fact that we keep trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more as team players, relying on each other's musical presence and letting it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons between our work and that of Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" is at number one.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a more popular style, towards a wider audience?
For example, we had no plans to write a hit song that would be the album's highlight.
This song is about more than that.
It was meant to be the final song on the album, and we wanted to break up the sonic orgy and the more difficult themes.
How did you choose the six female singers?
Why them? What was the guiding principle?
The idea was to make a gospel-style choir.
Then the idea came to form the choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was formed - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then called "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls co-create it?
Note: The song had been in the instrumental version for a while, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this song still needed something.
The chord progression has formally called for a vocal voice.
I learned the tune that night, and later the girls learned it.
It all came about practically on the spur of the moment and frighteningly spontaneously.
I remember, I was pretty electrified at the time, but the Divas did it.
With my voice alone, the song would never have been this powerful.
hvg.hu: But both on the record and at the concert, it seemed like the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no separate part, they sing perfectly together and they are no louder than the music, so their singing is not just accompanied by the music.
They were also behind on stage.
Is it on purpose?
BZ: The reason they were behind was purely technical.
But we didn't want to give them solo parts.
The number is also about forgetting your ego for a little bit, forgetting who came from where and where you are going, and just letting yourself be lifted up by these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel that euphoric state that we felt when that song came out.
hv.g.hu: What was the most expensive song?
For example: In the musical creation work, there were more difficult tasks in the mixing.
Like "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play a concert piano, or "Rock 'n' Roll Goes to the Girls", where the groove didn't want to work anymore, but gradually it all came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts and even now that I have "released" the album.
Currently, they are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent brokers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
The bottomless cheater
That's what he called his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, of the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It lost almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do it the same as his colleagues, and he was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all the big banks, he was able to spot the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's a bit of a weakling", his superiors reported to the police.
But as we can see from the statements of Kerviel published by the French media, for example by the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who had made profits of EUR 1.6 billion from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he claimed in his deposition.
In the summer he had managed to earn half a billion euros just from the American crisis.
He had seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previous repayment problems, were in trouble.
The crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe that and was right.
By the end of the year, he had boosted his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I had made the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it", Kerviel admits, and goes on to say that he definitely kept nothing for himself.
During the interrogation, he admitted to falsifying documents so that he wouldn't be caught.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even as the Eurex stock market began to take an interest in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so, not at all.
"I thought it would satisfy the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank".
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant to a realtor and in 2005 he became a self-employed realtor with an annual salary of $90,000.
But he knew he would never make as much as others.
"Even in my first interview in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development", Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after he was in office, his first big success came.
He made a lot of money with Allianz shares, betting half a billion euros on the losses of the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball", he told the policeman.
But the bosses were supposed to know everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes".
But then, early this year, the big hit came.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He's a suspect in a vacation.
"I only took four days off last year.
A real estate agent who does not take a holiday is one who does not want to be looked at", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and European Commission representatives yesterday signed a total of nine development programmes which will enable the Czech Republic to raise EUR 14 billion (about Kč 365 billion) over the next few years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
The total amount of about 125 billion kroner comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive some 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will go into transportation.
The transport programme is the largest development programme, accounting for up to 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative ventures.
The aim is to provide firms with the means to finance the introduction of new technologies, research and the introduction of more effective methods of organization.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful of the new accession countries in the acquisition of EU funds.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20-year prison sentence for former presidents
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of defrauding the country of $100 million (nearly $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his estate near the Nicaraguan capital.
The former head of state (1997-2002) of this Central American state is currently uncertain whether he will be sent back to prison.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officers whether Alemán is sent home or in prison.
A court case four years ago established that Alemán had been regularly transferring government funds to accounts in Panama held by foreign companies.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts were actually owned by his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money eventually ended up in a fund Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 campaign.
Budget is passed
Yes, it is done.
The state budget is approved.
What's so special about this budget?
It is the first budget of this government that has been adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it was presented by Minister Sobotka (from this party), and the ČSSD could not therefore afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives quietly approved this traditionally little-noticed, but nevertheless highly significant, law.
This is a paradox.
All government starts and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is obscured by the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A quarrel between politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets suffered under the previous Social Democratic governments from three weaknesses that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate all at once:
The first is the high share of legally-mandated spending, which is not just pensions but also social spending, which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a consequence of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the budget deficit of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government deficit.
This budget is public and is somewhat controlled.
The real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to tap other sources of investment besides tax, levy and bank loans, often unwisely issued bonds, which made them over-indebted to their councils.
In recent years they have been able to pay off this debt by selling off shares in the energy and other utilities that they received from the state in the privatization drive.
Now that spring is already dry.
In so far as we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we find that:
For some years now, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth, of which the ČSSD has been constantly proud.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to get their public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace, which is mainly the fault of the previous governments.
We are among the countries least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
The Commission has already taken the initiative of proposing a new directive on the protection of workers from harmful substances.
Even if we managed to cancel some of the senseless populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no shift in the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then practically all politics in this country will end, and whoever is in power will have nothing but pure administration.
It is a slight exaggeration to say that ruling politicians then become civil servants who divide the bulk of tax revenues mechanically between pensions and social spending.
The budget of this year cannot therefore be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The 70 billion kroner deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not spent what they could over the last decade.
If we do not want to see the ruling politicians become mere administrative officials, we must be patient and let this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to collect in taxes and fees, rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
The Commission has not yet taken the necessary steps to ensure that the budget is balanced.
The President of the Republic
Banks want to deal with crisis
The Federal Reserve of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
This will bring more than 100 billion dollars to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the US Federal Reserve is putting $40 billion up for auction, and the European and Swiss central banks are taking another $24 billion.
This is the first time since the 9/11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to defending against or mitigating the effects of a financial crisis.
"This move is designed to address the economy's biggest problem, the growing shortage of available capital that banks can lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm, in a report to his clients.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the probability of a US recession from 65% to about 50%", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost about $60 billion in loans that have not been serviced, especially in the United States.
Analysts are predicting billions more in losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what was to come when they decided to do this", said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad", he continued.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty in accessing bonds, their customers will have to pay more for their loans.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, potentially affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do this after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for interbank lending.
This means that banks have been constantly afraid to lend money to each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another rate cut", said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts believe that this move by the central banks is fueling the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, the fall of the US housing market.
Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Developing countries are said to be the most affected by global climate change.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the closing of the international UN conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book 'A blue planet, not a green one', he said the ecologists' debates were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, what is unacceptable is not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and those from non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a firework of words, which is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems", said Klaus.
The Czech President emphasized at the launch of his book that the subject matter of the book was very important to him and that this was the reason for his commitment.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book was being published in German translation because "I often come across caricatures of my views".
So now interested persons could read his attitude without any distortion.
Klaus reminded them that he was not a climatologist, but he felt he had the necessary skills to write such a book.
He was an academic, able to understand and assess technical papers, had experience in statistics and was also an economist.
The main thesis of the book is that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the evolution of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
In addition, as someone who has experience of totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly stated, when asked by those in attendance, that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
The same subject was discussed by Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driving licence
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving license by the end of the year.
The Ministry is not concerned that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the streets after the New Year without valid driving licences.
According to the authorities, the main ones who have not changed their driving licences are those who no longer want to drive.
While small towns report a sharp drop in interest in driver's license exchanges, the offices of the capital are being flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange was still growing this week.
The city administration handles about 2000 customers a day.
You have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
It takes 20 days to issue a new driver's license.
However, it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay an additional 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the required changeover by the end of the year and start driving without a valid driver's license will be fined from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
The police may also terminate the offence by a warning.
In case of a violation, the fine can rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, the person who does not drive at all can also be fined by the municipality.
He could, it was said, face a fine of up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry has already called on the authorities to be lenient and to impose a fine of not more than 1000 kroner.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a fine of a thousand crowns.
The driving licence is a document whereby everyone can decide whether he wants to have it or not.
It is not a form of identity card that everyone must have, a valid one.
People who don't want to drive anymore should turn in their driver's licenses.
It is sufficient to take it to the local authority office or send it by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
Drivers will also have to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three years to change.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million additional driver's licenses.
Court reduces sentences for detectives who were allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of colluding with David Berdych's gang, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
This was the final decision of the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced their sentences by one or two years.
The original sentence for detectives in the Office for Combating Organized Crime was 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal from today's ruling, only review by the Supreme Court.
Berdych himself is charged in this case, but he faces first the first instance judgment.
However, he had already received sentences totalling 16 years in other trials.
He can't be convicted of more than that.
A district court convicted 19 people in January, mainly for involvement in robberies, and the Superior Court of Appeal heard the appeals of 16 of them today.
Most of the defendants denied the charges from the beginning, saying that they were fabricated.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police officers, in collusion with Berdych criminals, inter alia, handed over information from police sources, covered up various robberies and helped gang members to evade prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30% of the loot.
The indictment is for crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robberies, in which victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for embezzlement and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, police discovered illegal handguns, steel-cores, a laser sight and a submachine gun.
The gang has, according to the indictment, made millions of crowns from their robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this case, Berdych and a number of others were found guilty by the courts of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are facing another trial, other cases have not yet come to court.
The main proceedings have so far been avoided by Mr Tomáš Půta and Mr Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
Children in exchange - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation of 12 million crowns from the hospital in Třebíč plus court costs.
Each mother gets three million, each father gets two million, and each child gets one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of $200,000 for each parent pair.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, therefore disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is far too high", Dostál said after today's hearing.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion which the opposite party has had produced.
We'll see if it's worth saying at all.
But we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all of them", stressed Dostál.
The amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the Jablonow family wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
Veleba used as a basis for negotiations on compensation an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children were found to have suffered from psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying intensity and depth by experts in the fields of psychology and psychiatry.
The men were more tolerant of the stressful situation, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
Women, on the other hand, are less able to cope with the aftermath of the trauma they have experienced, as well as with what is happening now, Veleba summed up.
Veronika and Nikola switched nurses at the maternity clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák family in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablonec.
At the end of October, the district head of Vysočina (Bohemian-Maha) handed each family 100000 crowns as compensation for expenses incurred by the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district's jurisdiction.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, and only exceptionally can they ask the institution for help.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low amounts of damages to victims, the amounts being determined by tables and ranging in the hundreds of thousands, with some exceptions, millions.
Polívka came for his kingdom Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trademark "Kingdom of Wallachia".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian king", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Mr Polívka did not attend today's hearing.
His lawyer says that the case is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team wanting to parasitically participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka", said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
When people heard the words "Kingdom of Walachi", they all thought of this actor and comedian.
That's what Harabiš thinks.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
"The key to success is to create a stronger and more effective network of people, and to develop a more effective and efficient network of people.
According to him, the reason is a dispute over money.
"After years, they realised that the project was a success and that they could have a share of it.
They want to parasitize our work", he continued.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka first used the term "King of Wallachia" in one of his TV programs.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But this was not at the time the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Walachi passports.
From an initially fun activity, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachic Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature on the passports, and even offered their owners discounts on visiting his farm and his theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used the idea that Polívka had made public in the show "Manege" for his business intentions.
"Polívka's popularity has certainly helped the Walachi Kingdom project", the judge said.
She added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had devoted themselves to it.
The cooperation of the now-confused parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But since then, the quarrels between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav I. elected until Saint Nimmerleins Day".
The leading role was then claimed by Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother at the suggestion of Harabišs.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court today dismissed.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the contest for the throne and half a princess prepared by Harabiš.
A new king was to be born.
He wouldn't give me any details or a date.
"We don't want to rush into anything.
It should be like the king's march in Wallachia.
The king was to be chosen for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka is also welcome to sign up,' added Mr Harabiš.
The Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: front end is shrinking
To tell you the truth, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shifting, steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The van with the SW mark is a bit further on, and I'm just going to have to reconsider my position.
For example, when I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, I had to complain about the lack of headroom on the back seats.
Now, those complaints are gone, for the body of the station wagon is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Keep moving
I'm just going through the interior so I don't have to repeat myself too much.
It is a fairly successful design, where I have only one objection to the pathetic central tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design where the car usually looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and the days of complaining about short seats or headrests are over.
The page content has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As for the space, you can also feel the increased dimensions of the body.
The Kombi also eliminates the lack of headroom mentioned earlier.
Baggage in the trunk
The main thing about this truck is the cargo compartment.
I have to say that it is very easy to load and saves space (also because of the folding backrest).
The cavities are equipped with retaining walls, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, they can be pulled apart and they can hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the cargo volume.
The table shows that the standard capacity is 428 litres, which is a rather average figure compared with the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling car in the Czech Republic of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot is lagging behind by a considerable 52 litres.
This value is already critical when going on a holiday abroad or when loading a baby carriage.
But to highlight the positive side, I must mention the very flat cargo space after the rear seats are folded or the very low cargo edge.
120 HP in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And frankly, this is what a 1600 cc engine should look like, powering a family hatchback.
It's quiet, low-power, and moves well.
If I compare it to its counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes looks as if its exhaust is blocked with a cloth, then I can only be delighted by it.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine is 329900 crowns.
With our motor it costs 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car is worth 80,000 kroner in addition to Buche.
But we had copper bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, electric window sills in the back and and...
The car's total cost is just 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but add up the extra equipment for a Fabia and you'll come up with a pretty similar sum.
So now it's just a matter of deciding which brand to go with.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, raising concerns among the local population about the future development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far been hampered by a number of obstacles.
British schools are even reporting cases of increased violence between immigrant and native children.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where there is a gradual increase in conflict between the local population and Slovak immigrants.
Fights, bullying, and fights among students have spilled over into parental relationships.
The situation has developed to the point that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman for beating a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after a Slovakian immigrant was attacked by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks about the man and had thrown stones at him.
"On the way home, a boy climbed on a bus stoop and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his ass", described another unpleasant incident a mother of Slovak schoolchildren to The Times.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the conflict with the Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited are evidence of the growing tension between local and immigrant students in British schools.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have reported coming here in search of work.
The UK has a population of around 30,000 Slovak students.
Cuba - The Most Beautiful Island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you want from your vacation, it will come true if you choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or a sea that's as calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiter who serves pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
You find it in abundance on the islands of the Caribbean.
But there is one island where you can find much more, and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
In the Spanish era, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen from America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the American mafia bosses, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
I'm not sure I can do it.
In Havana, tall buildings were built, and on the wide boulevards, cars were driven, becoming cult symbols of the 1950's.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and he had his yacht in Cojímar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America signed their names.
What about today?
You can also sign your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
The bar at the Hotel Nacional will be mixing cocktails for you.
And the 1950s cult cars still drive around Havana today because the once imported schigulis and fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
The old part of Havana, in particular, is very dilapidated, and nowhere else in the area are so many wonderful colonial sites to be found.
Other places are being cleared out, like Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, this development was given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, and others.
Cuba also has a marotte, the only one in the world, that is especially attractive to railway enthusiasts.
The sugar pipes from remote plantations brought steam and diesel narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Its rolling stock has not been updated for decades, so you can see neat and fully functioning locomotives, whose contemporaries are already in the museum.
Destinations of excursions
The most important places are not missed by the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It remains to mention that the Hemingway estate, already mentioned, houses a museum that is not to be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on calcareous soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, their cavities accumulate fertile soil, which also covers weathered rock areas with dense vegetation.
This is the valley where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see it in its final form when you visit one of the Havana cigar factories.
Some may also find it interesting that the Chilean episode of the TV series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
The following table shows the
An ancient city, founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Her fame and wealth came from the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the ornamental beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has changed little in four hundred years.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that as late as the 1950's there was no road connecting the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to keep it from being noticed.
Nothing was built there, but nothing was demolished, so everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than an afternoon to spare in Trinidad, it is worth seeing some of the interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón or the "Sugar Factory Valley".
In the evening, go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark, and where the music doesn't stop until the morning.
Other, of a fat content, by weight
This small town in the eastern part of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly, the way they travel to these places will also influence their view.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo to there must cross high and jagged mountains and pass through a landscape that has been little touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unspoilt nature.
There, the finest chocolate is made, the church features the Columbus cross (actually, it was made about a hundred years after Columbus' voyages), and from the hill where the former castle, now the El Castillo Hotel, stands, several table mountains can be seen, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
The coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the Sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, an African religion professed by the descendants of slaves, all of which could be written about many pages.
Yes, as they say, it's better to see for yourself.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
The United States has said that the shortage of troops and the lack of equipment will affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The EU must also take action to ensure that the EU does not become a victim of the terrorist attacks.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going according to their ideas, and this was agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the representatives of the countries which have units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further plans for coordination among the allies.
The United States, through its Secretary of State for Defence, Robert Gates, is calling for more action by NATO forces, while the UK sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and in stepping up development aid.
"There is a sense of progress in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the people to start their own economic and security development", British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent of the time
The Afghan insurgent activity has reached its highest level in five years, according to the US military.
The number of violent incidents increased by 27 percent compared with the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
The United States, however, believes that the Allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We're going to have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them", Gates said.
The same was said today by the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"I'm not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90% of the troops and equipment we need, and that's too little", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been a dispute among the countries involved in recent months about whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only minimal violence and the combat requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper The Sun this week called the German soldiers "lazy".
"Afghan non-violence unmasked: Germans play games while our boys fight", the Sun wrote in a post, accompanied by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on the offensive and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt to hit one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84000 crowns.
Total debt by the end of September was 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to incur 159.2 billion kroner in debt this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of the state budgetary policy.
The public debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its figures for the government debt at the beginning of October.
Each Czech is owed 84,000 crowns.
The state's debt over the whole of last year was more than 111 billion kroner.
"So far, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not cross the threshold of one trillion kroner until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns", said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, the iHNed.cz server.
Vladimír Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, sees a similar situation: "We could reach the billion mark in the course of 2009.
Exactly when depends on the next household we don't know about.
If the situation on the political stage changes and politicians are prepared to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change", he remarked.
Debt increases
The national debt is the result of government debt and is mainly the result of the accumulation of deficits in the national budget.
The public debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct borrowings or, for example, by European Investment Bank bonds.
The national debt has risen to SEK 719.4 billion this year.
The state's foreign debt has risen by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable public debt reached SEK 803.3 billion at the end of September and decreased by SEK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the public debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose 13 percent from the first to the third quarter of the year, which is really high considering how well the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done even before the pension reform comes", Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of the public debt for 2007 indicate that the government had planned to raise 159,2 billion kroner for that year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of the state budgetary policy.
This is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which is expected to reach SEK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated SEK 91.3 billion.
The other items are a maximum amount of 13.3 billion kroner for the consolidation agency, a reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of 43 billion in government bonds and 1.8 billion in instalments for the European Investment Bank bonds.
For naming a teddy bear, she was taken to court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who was charged in Sudan with insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison and deported by a court in Khartoum on Thursday night.
The British actress was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old schoolchildren to name a teddy bear after Mohammed, even though any depiction of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be whipped.
After several complaints by parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- and seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
"The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", says school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Muhammad as their favorite first names.
Sure, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it's also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the bear's picture on it and the caption "My name is Mohammed".
The bear itself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and she would not have done anything to impede her religious beliefs, "I just never regret asking the children to vote on a name", he said, adding that it was just an "innocent mistake".
Many of the teacher's students share her opinion, describing her as "very attentive to her students" and "a person who never speaks about religion in class".
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given last name in the UK, with 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a form of homage to the Prophet (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can a toy be given this?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
On Wednesday, the final negotiating session in Vienna failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final round of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without overcoming their controversy over the future status of the breakaway province.
'It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status,' said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
The European Union is also calling on the Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's policies are consistent with the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, and to ensure that the EU's policies are consistent with the objectives of the Lisbon strategy.
'No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time', he added, indicating that there are clearly tensions.
End of the negotiations on 10 December
The Troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, 90% of which is Albanian-speaking, could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika received the mandate from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing the negotiations beyond that deadline.
Russia has been and remains a supporter of a negotiated solution, a negotiated solution, said Ms Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration, the West considers independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
'Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached,' said the president of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where the 'last chance negotiations' have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future premier of the province, shared his grief.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan proposed by Belgrade was 'part of a past that has led to murders and deportations'.
The 'domino effect'
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, said that a compromise was always desirable and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence for the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a 'domino effect' in a region still so weakened by the war of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible", he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would be made solely in the Security Council, where their Russian ally holds a veto.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
"Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia", declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told journalists that "the parliament of Kosovo will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would be made "in consultation" with Western countries.
Bush tricks Israelis into agreeing with the Palestinians
President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration at the opening of the international peace conference he chaired in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday.
He went on to explain that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
Bush promised in front of the two men that he would do everything possible to help them conclude a "peace deal" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "the terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas were ultimately aimed at a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the core issues.
This term encompasses the three major issues on which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is largely centred: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were displaced from their homeland in the 1948 conflict, which is now the State of Israel.
After the US President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "comprehensive and thorough" and provide a settlement on all issues, including "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the EU's role in the fight against terrorism, which calls for the EU to take action to combat terrorism and to promote the fight against terrorism.
Bush has set the deadline for the end of 2008 for the implementation of his "vision of two states", one Palestinian and one Israeli, side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it received a similar assurance from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
The Arab world, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries, offering Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is at the root of the conflict and its central aspects", said the Saudi prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
The prosecutor's office believes the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, there's official version and rumor.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial findings of the investigation by the National Disciplinary Police Board (IGPN), a police car was driving on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
"He was not on duty, but was on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without any blue lights", a police spokesman said.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, 'not registered, not open to public traffic' (see below), was approached 'at very high speed' by two young people without helmets.
"It struck the left side of the police car after ignoring its right-hand approach", a police officer said.
The alcohol tests carried out on the vehicle passengers were very negative.
The condition of the car (swollen mud flaps, shattered windshield, broken bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, just yesterday morning, the public prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary homicide and lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main department for public safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excluded the responsibility of the police at this stage of the IGPN investigation.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the police's version, that this small motorcycle had arrived relatively quickly on her left side".
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the foot rails on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been impounded and will be subject to a technical inspection.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, a rumour spread quickly in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, and without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains cautious, it would also rule out 'any serious errors' in this matter.
According to a police source, 'this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation and must be handled with great care'.
Libération has an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
"We went out immediately with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her", the witness relates.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw "a policeman who was completely disturbed and limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth made a phone call".
In view of the tension that had quickly developed around the incident and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the youths' hopeless situation, the police were taken away by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
According to this witness, the rescue workers arrived "about twenty minutes after the police had left".
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be said that the police did not help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
Fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahore in the east of the country, some 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades fired by the police, according to witnesses.
They threw stones at the policemen, injuring them.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily detained.
Similar scenarios have been seen in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers have attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court Bar Association have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of around 500 arrests of oppositionists, human rights advocates and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked off to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations were reported in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-east).
The lawyers' movement received support on Monday from the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the public to send flowers to the judges who opposed the state of emergency and to send the trash to those who took an oath to Musharraf.
"Musharafs promise is no longer in force"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday night.
He was forced to comment in the following days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
"All that we stand for is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court", the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to relinquish command of the army and become a civilian president has "no longer been valid" since the state of emergency was declared, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by November 15, the date his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the elections could be postponed from January.
The Pakistani government also denied persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been given a place of residence by his deputy commander.
Still, more than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Even today, 40 years after the Neuwirth law was passed, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is unplanned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
The IED estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or the IUD, still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of women between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed for better 'fertility control'.
In any case, eight out of ten births today are carefully planned.
One in five couples even calculate the month exactly, and, if possible, in the spring, the time of year when it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular Repair at the Space Station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members on the International Space Station (ISS) spent more than seven hours in space performing the spectacular repair of a faulty solar collector that is essential to the continuing scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has set several records for its duration, removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools "made by hand" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose Wednesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical piece that will soon be used by European and Japanese science labs.
This module is a sort of landing bridge to the module labs.
But you have to be able to power them.
The crew's second task was to convert a 17.5-ton solar module already on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to rearrange the module's solar panels, which span 250 feet [76 m].
And what happened was that one of the collectors, which are like accordions, got damaged by a cable that was jammed into it, about three feet long.
The restructuring was stopped to prevent further damage to the collector.
The astronauts, who were originally scheduled to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a check-in and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the end of the space shuttle's 100-foot-long remote-controlled arm that was attached to the station to perform the repair.
He's one of the best spacewalkers at NASA.
Tall, tough, very skilled, he has a well-developed torso and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was therefore chosen to operate on the injured solar collector.
After examining the damage, he cut the faulty wire and attached some kind of rails to the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock to the solar panels, which generate several hundred volts, had been devised and "made" by the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the collector to fully unfold before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before returning to the space shuttle Discovery today, with seven astronauts expected to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the group Aviation and Defence announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to compensate for the A400M deficit, EADS shares are currently showing a significant decline on the Paris stock exchange.
EADS is currently trading at a loss of 4% to €21.96 on the Paris stock exchange.
The group was forced to revise its business forecasts for 2007 in view of the delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delayed the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to 'between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion is for Airbus', announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
The costs will force EADS to announce new operating profit targets (EBIT) for 2007 when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday, he added, without giving further details.
The group also states that the estimation of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
It should be recalled that EADS's operating performance fell by 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large A380 aircraft.
Originally, the group had planned to deliver the first A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday, the counting of the ballots will not be exciting: the masses of Russians will vote for President Putin's United Russia party.
After a very close election campaign, it confirms its desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the electorate in a message broadcast on public television, which has been recorded but the content of which is kept secret.
He is doing so in his capacity as the leading candidate of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party which is expected to win a landslide victory.
Yesterday, the president was oblivious when he received foreign ambassadors, and contented himself with delivering a new attack on the Western powers, who are accused of interference - his favorite topic during the election campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud", he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they are wrong.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziouganov says there "had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Yeltsin".
Following the crackdown on demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in jail for unlawful demonstration, is still banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have retained the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus".
After these elections without tension, two far more important questions arise:
- Who will be Putin's successor as president?
The Official Gazette announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, who will choose the government and the president?
Whatever happens, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the old power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their own fate", says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Levada Centre.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes even further back: In this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe, civil society developed very slowly; the famous spirit of community retarded the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not followed by terror but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "freely renouncing the personal responsibility" they showed for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think about it?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional heads) lead the local electoral lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion by Tamara Cheretnitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why wait?
Those in power aren't so bad, why are they being replaced?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now open to the public.
The 47 million documents in the archive, which are located in Bad Arolsen, covering a total area of 27 km, could not be accessed until now, except for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and by name, that is, at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the 11 countries responsible for its administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to make it available to researchers and historians.
The ratification process of this Decision has been completed and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct research, 'especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of forced labourers', explains Reto Meistern, head of the archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The lists of concentration camp inmates or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labor and, if necessary, to provide them with evidence of their arrest, thus paving the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen still deal with tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, some members of the scientific community have shown limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
"One should not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents", declared Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India are aiming to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
The trade between India and Europe is already worth 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
The European Trade Minister, Peter Mandelson, and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner.
'A free trade pact will bring a huge boost to the two economies' and 'India's access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans would be improved', confirmed Peter Mandelson.
The European Commissioner went on to say that Europe is the first or second market for the 10 most exported products from India.The Asian and European giants exchange '€47 billion worth of goods' and '€10 billion worth of services' annually, Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, and regretted that trade between them 'has not yet reached its full potential'.The EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England is taking note of the concern and is offering £10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday, anxious to contain the recurrent worry over credit conditions, announced a £10 billion offer at a 5.75% base rate for five weeks, an unusual offer with a maturity of five weeks.
In order to allay fears that financial market conditions will be particularly tough at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about how to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase, which starts on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, it said in a statement.
The bank further explains that in this way, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation at the base tax rate on 6 December at 12.15 GMT and only until 10 January.
This appears to be the first time the BoE has ever put five weeks' worth of liquidity into circulation in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE's communication adds that it is "prepared to take further action to maintain the"day-to-day differential" of interbank lending rates with its base rate.
The daily variation in the interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the financial crisis of the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penalties which have prevented the banks from using them.
According to some rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, drawn up in the context of a socialist "niche" (a meeting initiated by a parliamentary group), listed some ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, the majority of which, 50%, were on employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP flottante, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After the UMP and the NC voted against the revision of the articles (180 votes against 115), the sitting was dissolved after the main debate, which occasioned some violent exchanges of views between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the television contribution of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present the totality of its proposals as an amendment to the draft law on the financial correction, which was considered by the Assembly last week.
A New Festival Is Born
In the wake of numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer is canceling the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America, no more and no less", Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 is hosting the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will take place August 8-10, on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational functions of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the 'most inspiring event' he has ever been to, says that his company and Melvin Benn's are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
"We have chosen Philadelphia as our market and are working hard with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
We negotiated with the city and the commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been caught up in political debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we've been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we're making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the people".
C3 Presents has brought the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival to life at Grand Park Chicago after making its mark on the festival scene in 2002 alongside the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross taxpayer days in 2007 respectively.
Both of these festivals are held in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more of an urban green space", says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to somehow blend these two concepts together to convey the impression of a rural festival in the European way and an urban one in the American way".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is happy to take on the burden of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but confirms that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival that will hopefully have a long life".
Charlie Jones says that the festival's recording capacity is "very large", roughly equivalent to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of audiences", says Charlie Jones.
His partners at C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy getting the main stage for Hollywood movies to Montreal when no less than the Terminator is against it.
These attempts to lure are part of the delegate's duties.
A politically "tricky mandate" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is denouncing Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Governator"?
"You have to be careful because it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that are considered the best", he says.
The run at the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of local cinema is the top priority at the moment.
The Oscar hunt has begun.
All the festivals on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's going to be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the billboard in Santa Monica and will premiere at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market on the brink of a year-end rally?
With just under five weeks until the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the coming year-end rally.
However, the experts cannot make any firm forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that "from a purely statistical point of view, the month of December is usually associated with a positive market development in the stock market.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts on a short-term basis and on the basis of statistics only, especially when serious tensions are determining current market developments.
Although other experts do not approve of such a sharp rise in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that "the stock market price is determined by the liquidity of the market and the market participants, who, due to the lack of safe stock funds, invest mainly in pension funds, which are strongly affected by the upward trend towards high-yield assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will tend to have a more lateral trend influenced by market fluctuations, "mainly because we cannot yet assess the extent of the possible decline in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate, an uncertainty mainly due to the increased price of crude oil and the risk of rising inflation rates".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold moment to announce an upcoming market rally.
"The chances are not very good", the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4% since its peak of 15 945.7 on 8 November.
But not all experts share this negative view.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could end the year with almost 16 000 points, as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional provisioning of the pension fund, which is carried out every year at this time.
However, the expert points out that things could be a little different this year, especially because of the end-of-year rally that is already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore right after the bridge day to the Constitution Day.
The analyst believes that the price fluctuations would not affect the market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the assessments of the market situation so far are at a level that is almost technical, which could lead to 'a deviation from the index values whose magnitude depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
The analysts are unanimous in their choice of the values that will propel the Ibex to new heights.
Solana of Intermoney said that "this year it is the turn of the big values".
The expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies as the "highest value winners, because the electricity sector will be too expensive at some point".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by a link with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally does happen, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
ACS has been on a catching-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, says the expert.
In the last half of the year, periodic consumption will determine market developments.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also generate positive sales results, even if they are only a small number of them on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only on two occasions did December witness a decline in the price of oil.
The bursting of the tech bubble at the end of 2003 brought the stock market out of its crisis and triggered the last real end-of-year rally.
This year, with the Ibex 35 gaining 28.17 points, December saw a 6.68% increase.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and will also show a year-end rally remains to be seen.
Popular will have its 200 lending institutions open 12 hours a day, Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically developed regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these new branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, Popular being the first banking group to take the leap of extending the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 8.30 pm and on Saturdays from 10 am to 8.30 pm.
BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in its branches, has not yet taken a final decision.
The Bank's negotiations with the trade unions, which are currently under way, seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement whereby 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and will open on a weekday afternoon, although not for customers.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which will adapt business opening hours, will depend on Popular Bank's experience.
And that is precisely the intention of Popular with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, because of their location, can attract the shopping-minded clientele of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but rather have changed opening hours.
The Bank will therefore re-design the premises of those branches already located in business zones, while at the same time adapting them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of the opening hours is combined with a new layout of the branches, which is characterised by a more up-to-date, more colourful design.
The representative of the bank responsible, Ángel Rivera, assures that the restructuring would not require major investments, but would involve an increase in staff recruitment, since a branch would no longer need six but eight or nine employees.
The offices, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience scores were positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the name Mundocredit, which specialize in immigrants, also have extended hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
These PopularMax branches will not use the BBVA model, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
"We don't want to be a competitor for our customers", explains Rivero.
They have reached a provisional agreement with Telefonica to sell mobile phones through the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco has doubled its market value for the first time, beating rivals Antena 3 and Telecinco.
"We did it".
This was the phrase used by the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, to express his satisfaction at the close of the stock exchange, when the station he was managing had increased its value by twice that of its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: "This is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had less losses", he said.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they had "not fallen too low".
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a gain of 2.54%.
That profit reduces his previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the value of the company now stands at EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%), and Vocento only holding 13% of the capital.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has posted a total loss of 40.5% since January, so that its market value at 2.193.46 million is halved.
The market value of other publicly traded communications companies, on the other hand, is rising: Sogecable's to 3.571 million, Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that 'they are two similar companies', according to Vasile.
The question remains uncertain as to the extent to which we can actually operate in a stock exchange-like manner, at what price and how we can make it profitable at the customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago that it would be the first television station to generate more than 1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, as confirmed by Guiseppe Tringali, managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising arm.
If the plan were to be implemented, the channel would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million it had in the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net turnover rose by 1.6% in the first nine months of trading (to 734.4 million), while net television revenues rose by only 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor behind Telecinco's comparatively better performance on the stock market is seen by analysts as the high payout ratio the company has achieved to date: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría paid a 100% dividend.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio may still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as the parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
"We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always given much more.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already raised by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing some loss-making tendencies.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation for Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the projected growth rate, which will fall from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
It also reduced the profit forecast for Antena 3 by 4,5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
Three options to choose from.
1 .
Ibersecurities: relying on its high effective return and sustainable potential, therefore recommends buying both shares.
2. the
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) is in a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) due to the 'multiple incentives' and the prosperous market.
3. the
JPMorgan: recommends lowering expectations in both cases in view of "similar threats" (saturated market and weaker economic climate)
The Congress approves the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary work, which ended today with the Senate's decision on the amendments to the draft, the Government published the provisions resulting from the new law, with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the members of the Congress and the Senate, whose deliberations and votes were aimed at establishing the best possible system guaranteeing the security of investors and regulating the activities of individual entrepreneurs, in order to guarantee an overall efficient market operation.
The MIFID, which redefines the securities regulation, aims, in addition to the modernisation of the financial markets, to improve investor protection, increase the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new directive allows financial advice to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and also contributes to the creation of new financial services firms (ESIFs), the advisory firms which merge with investment and securities brokerage companies.
It also extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding to the regulated markets for circulation the multilateral securities trading systems and the systems for the internationalization of trading orders, which would eventually enter into competition with the current economic operators.
The law requires investment firms to disclose the focuses of their corporate profile, the nature of the competition and the way in which they deal with risks in the market, and to register all operations carried out, in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Congressional Budget Committee subsequently proposed further changes, with the decision that securitised debt securities must now be considered "complex" financial assets because of their high risk to the investor being confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crises.
In addition, the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of graduate economists was adopted, 30 years after the 1977 regulation limiting the fields of work reserved for economists.
The Senate also introduced new positions in the financial sector, such as that of an economic intermediary working for another person, who does not need to be authorised by the CNMV and can offer his services to commercialise products and attract clients to several investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
The publication of this data is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to provide data on the basis of a comparison of location and quality with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be made in advance by using the same approach as the HICP, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator, which was determined in advance, was only indicative and therefore did not have to match the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance, Pedro Solbes, said that the increase in the CPI in November was a "temporary development" and that the price index would remain at a "relatively high" level in the coming months.
However, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress Building that "even if the current figure is not good", Spain's inflation differential with the other members of the monetary union has remained "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also said that November had "fewer surprises" than the previous month, when the government had not expected such a large increase.
"We expect a figure of around 4%", said the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance, referring to the forecast published today.
Virgin is projecting revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years with Northern Rock
The value of Northern Rock's holdings has fallen by more than half since the bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in the midst of the crisis in September last year, and they now amount to only £12 billion (equivalent to €16 billion).
At that time, the bank's assets were at a record £25,000 million, a figure that has fallen considerably in two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and will continue to fall until the end of the crisis, despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe.
The Virgin Group, which would continue to run the group after the takeover under the Virgin Money brand, would have to contribute about a quarter of the income of the UK banks that will be assembled from the investments there over the next three years to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds needed to reach its 30 billion pound target.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his flashy advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (equivalent to about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, which has three other companies as its preferred bidder to help it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested on suspicion of participation in urban corruption
Spanish police arrested the current mayor of Totano, a town in the Murcia region, this morning on suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was uncovered this week.
The secretary of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo, who was in office last May as a representative of Juan Morales, currently a Popular Party MP and then mayor of Totana, may have been the original mastermind of the plot, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER.
Officials are continuing to search the records of the city and the Department of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
The lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption that was discovered earlier this week, was also charged.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the "popular" and therefore privileged member of parliament Juan Morales was arrested when he left his client's residence due to important incriminating documents that are supposed to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the alleged contractual payments by Morales to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract, in which the development of a 200 hectares of land was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an electoral victory, in Congress.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to head the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory for the Socialists, to assume the office of President of the Congress.
This was announced by José Blanco, the organisational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at the party headquarters today.
The Prime Minister said the offer to the former minister was justified, as it was 'important to be able to count on the best' in politics and Bono was 'among the best'.
The party's leader, who is from Mancha, would also "probably" run for the presidency of the congress if the Socialists win the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress, who announced on November 15 that he would not run in the next general election, that he would end his career in public policy and that he would instead work in the university sector for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that the prime minister had been continuously pushing for his return to politics since his resignation two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to hide from the citizens who would take over the post of President of the Congress in the event of an election victory, calling this an "act of transparency".
If he does take office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a "house of respect, not of insult or shouting", so that it "will look more and more like the citizens".
'Unfortunately, from time to time, it seems that the only place where you cannot speak calmly in Madrid is the Congress; the President of the Government has been interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.'
He also praised the current president, Manuel Martín, for "his good work" and said he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken office, as his political opponents would call it "arrogance".
Climate change propaganda is being used
As the climate debate is subject to relentless criticism from both climate change skeptics and those who promote social and political debate on the issue, the movement as a whole must demonstrate strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, like the Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and even proposes to conclude a "new contract with the planet".
However, this proposal puts him in a binding binding on the actions or inactions of his government, which has played a decisive role in placing Spain at the top of the list of countries in the EU that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for the failure to meet the requirements, what sectors are responsible for this and why has his government, which proposed the "Contract with the Planet", not stopped this development.
The Commission is also now obliged to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take to combat climate change in a straightforward manner.
The Commission's proposal is to set up a European network of national savings banks, which will be able to provide the necessary financial support to the European economy.
More specifically, who will have to sacrifice and pay for saving the planet.
However, there has been and will be no such explanation.
Because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be used to combat climate change are not popular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous to Zapatero from an electoral point of view that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
So we have to save the planet with nothing, with nothing but propaganda and empty words, with no real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician who is otherwise suited to campaigning does not have to speak, accuse or demand, but instead to pursue the demanding issue, to decorate the meetings and to inspire others with his gentleness and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not stipulate that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or that we will only be allowed to refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana for alleged involvement in a city-building corruption.
The Guardia Civil arrested the mayor of Totana, a town in Murcia, and the "popular" politician José Martínez Andreo, as well as the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel owner, on suspicion of urban planning violations, investigators said today.
The councilor was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office, where he is still, surrounded by numerous agents who also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction department of "Suelo Industrial y Vivienda".
The three arrests are linked to the investigations that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land were to be converted for urban development projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4000 apartments on the land after the local administration had illegally commissioned it during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested but were subject to an investigation initiated and carried out by the First Court of Totona.
The first six people arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to the investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and the then independent PP deputy Juan Morales are also being investigated.
The former wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, are also under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G., whose company was part of Nuaria and who allegedly received the bribe.
The investigation is being carried out by the Municipal Urban Crime Unit, under the supervision of the Guardia Civil Central Unit, whose representatives carried out, in addition to the arrests, eleven more searches, most of them in businesses directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a well-known local poultry business, who was allegedly acting as a middleman.
The "Nuaria" construction group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia area, with over 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of redeveloped land in Totana, with the aim of realising a building project that would bring the population of the municipality to 25,000.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the car parks of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector; and Preconiza, which specialises in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent explains the comment published yesterday in the leading Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is, incidentally, at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November, coincidentally on the day when the edition contained the review of the book Blackburns.
The content of the Philosophy course has become the subject of public debate following the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The man responsible for the brutal murders is a high school graduate who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Philosophy Education Council, Pekka Elo, urged teachers to take a more critical stance towards Plato and suggested that the teaching of Plato be removed from the lower-level philosophy curricula in high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law punishable by six months in prison.
If you rob a music store with a value of less than 400 euros, you are only considered to be a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the store up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is considered a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still less than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than in a music data exchange.
Participation in a rebellion is punishable by imprisonment for three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Penal Code), while exchange of data is punishable by imprisonment for six months to two years.
The applicant has been granted a stay of execution of two years.
E. According to Article 184 (2) of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The penalty for the sale of copyrighted films which have not been authorized by the authors is higher than for the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone has raised his standards.

My doctor hands me one of his long, strange research papers, entitled, "Money activates certain areas of the brain, especially when others get more of it".
So the feelings that come from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was carried out using a reference tomographic magnetic analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the latest edition of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn-based Life&Brain Research Centre, "the activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed".
The researchers found that when both participants got their answers right and received the same amount of money, their brain activity was always very moderate, but when one of them got twice as much, their brain activity was also more intense".
I am not quite sure that it really requires that much scientific effort to arrive at such a result.
The Balkan prosecutor
For eight years Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing the perpetrators of the Balkan wars, based in the Office of the Prosecutor of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, in The Hague.
Her term of office will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with tears in her eyes and a smile on her face, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on a list drawn up by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary film 'La Lista de Carla' (2006, not yet released in Spain); a film which, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her quest to trace the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their nets.
What insurance is best for me?
The insurance of motor vehicles covering a possible accident caused by the driver involves a high cost, the amount of which depends on several factors, including age, sex, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it's even harder to find the right car insurance than the right car model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are dealing with here.
A car insurance policy is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company shall receive the agreed insurance premium and in return shall be obliged to provide the corresponding indemnity in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance policy, which is composed of several factors, including age, sex, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that higher accident risks lead to higher premiums.
This is why both women and those over 25 have to pay less, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate because of their prudence.
The same applies to married people, as statistics and therefore also the opinion of the companies show that they are less likely to be involved in accidents than single people.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When calculating the premium, insurance companies have to take into account a number of factors.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly to choose the car insurance that best suits his personal needs.
We have listed the main points to consider when choosing an insurance policy, so that you can make a choice that is not only based on benefits but also on price.
The European Commission has published a new report on the impact of the EU's new policy on young people.
Even if it is best to take out a full cover for ideal cover, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The prudent can opt for a fully insured car with a premium, so that the benefits of a full insurance policy are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract requires that the customer pay part of the amount of the damage itself.
'The amount is set before the contract is concluded and is based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid,' explains Luis Noguera, the main representative for Spain at First Europa, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire, and loss of vehicles.
Here's a little advice.
If you are under 25, it is in your power to lower your insurance costs; thus, your credit score will increase as you try to drive safely and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariffs.
'The amount of credits and fines depends on the company and its income.
"If the company has a good year behind it can afford to increase bonus payments", Noguera explains.
Once the 25 year mark is passed, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract, because the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
It is therefore most sensible to opt for a full-cask insurance with a deductible.
'Normally young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving,' explains the Spanish manager of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the 'beginner's fear' has been removed.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who has no children to take out full-term insurance, provided, of course, that the financial situation of the person concerned allows it.
The insurers consider that couples with children are the customers with the lowest accident rate, and their contribution payments are also correspondingly low.
In this case, a full-cover insurance with a deductible (for an amount of around EUR 300) would be the best option.
'They drive more relaxed overall and have more purchasing power, which allows them to pay a higher contribution', says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full-checkout insurance with a personal contribution (for an amount of about 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it involves high costs, requiring a careful choice that is appropriate to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to score in Milan for the last 16
The Italian side will be playing in the San Siro on Tuesday to claim the missing point to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League qualifying round, with the Italians needing the point to top their group while the Scots will decide whether they will play.
The Italian team already has five points and confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another one to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they will compete in the semi-final on the 13th for the first time to qualify for the final, which will take place on the 16th.
The draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the result expected by all, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home with Celtic Glasgow, who would be the first in the group in case of a victory and thus have a better starting position in the last eight.
Gordon Strachan's team could even qualify with a defeat to FC Shakhtar, but he should not rely on such circumstances, as the Ukrainians are in the running with a nine-point tie, having lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but winning the second game (2-0).
The Milan team will try to spoil the Scots, who are hoping to reach the last 16 of the rebuilt Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the previous season in the same round by a goal from Kaka in the second half (1-0) and by a 0-0 draw in the second half.
While FC Shakhtar awaits the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to concentrate on their own game, as both reaching the round of 16 and their membership in UEFA depend on their victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Benfica Lisbon, despite its lowest position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, could win by finishing in third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour since the band's disbandment in 2000 in front of 20,000 spectators in Vancouver, Canada.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said that the mood in the reunited band was 'outstanding' shortly before their concert at GM Place de Vancouver.
The concert was attended by some 20,000 people in the sold-out stadium, who were shown a video about the history of the band, which had caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincided with the release of a new album, which included their biggest hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo", and which was released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on stage, which had been given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds of fans in the audience, who brought the GM Palace to glow, despite the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star "hasn't seen our wardrobe once, so I'm very curious to see what he thinks of the performance".
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to internal disagreements" led to the group's dissolution two years later, expressed her nervousness at a press conference two hours before the concert.
"I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I could see that the world's public attitude had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought, why not; so I'm glad I made this decision", Chisholm said of the band's split, which she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that "the arguments have been resolved and everyone is very fond of each other again".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls' last appearance together in 1998.
First, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane, according to a report by CTV.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of nannies.
The five of them have seven children.
After the Vancouver show, the band will next play in California, San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid, they will take the stage on December 23.
New fears over gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia is raging, raising the risk that Russian fuel exports to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia's natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) pass through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two nations is closely watched.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the main transit countries in talks", Ukraine's Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
'The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.'
In the last big natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which has dramatically raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's gas supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'needs to check foreign workers'
The Scottish National Health Service must improve its criminal records checks for non-European workers, a member of the watchdog said.
The recommendation by Chief Financial Officer Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish National Health Service had no precise idea of the number of its foreign staff.
But his report indicated that other important controls were correctly performed on a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller examined staff recruited from outside the European Economic Area following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an SUV drove through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October, and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
The National Health Service is expected to carry out pre-employment checks on foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The Chief Auditor's report now recommends, among other things, that the Board of Directors should adopt guidelines from the Criminal Record Extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found references to these checks in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out", the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities were following their pre-employment screening guidelines to a high degree, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of foreign health service workers".
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations into the hiring of potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current NHS Scotland referral tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide", he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign staff, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, partly because boards were having trouble identifying those on indefinite leave.
The investigation also found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian had been overwhelmingly followed.
This includes passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines on pre-employment screening for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport".
She added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take the report's recommendations into account and ensure that best practice is reflected in updated guidelines on pre-employment screening for all staff, including those from overseas, which are due to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the film biography of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five British Independent Film Awards, including Best Film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast as Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was named best leading actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing British film to the world.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - whose soundtrack features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was made for just £3 million.
Nevertheless, it won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two awards - best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award show at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a Russian mafia boss's driver in David Cronenberg's London thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, which was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney that opened doors for people like me", he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored".
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are chosen by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom. The Bifa Foundation has also been involved in the development of the Bifa Foundation.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terror plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their affiliation with cells that were planning an imminent attack on an oil facility as well as clerics and security forces.
State television in the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect facilities after a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refinery at Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Home Office, says 18 of the detainees were part of a cell run by a "missile expert" who had entered the country illegally.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees were reportedly plotting to kill clergymen and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis who are seeking to join forces with Al Qaeda militias in Iraq to fight the allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias are seen by many clerics in Saudi Arabia as collaborating with the authorities in support of the royal family's policies that dominate the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months", an Interior Ministry spokesman told state television.
The arrests also involved a "Median cell" of 16 from Medina that aimed to promote "Takfiri Thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims who are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate of Venus may provide a glimpse of the future of the earth
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit shows that the planet is even more like Earth's inverted twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been similar to those on Earth and might even have been habitable.
But because of the unchecked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a very different course of evolution.
Today, the planet is water-scarce, with a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead, and is ravaged by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sobering glimpse of how the Earth might develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the directors of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar".
"Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment".
"Enriched Uranium" seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovakian and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
All open
Mitt Romey said he didn't think it was worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidate eventually agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters would record questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions that were asked on Wednesday night, November 28th, were as ridiculous as the Snowman asking Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected the state of the Republican Party as it heads into next year's elections.
It's not known, nor are the CNN producers who supported the debate, who chose the YouTube clips to show the aspiring candidates.
However, the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
It's one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn on a voting booth when they heard things they liked: The network noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke harshly about boundaries.
The most intense and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national frontrunner, and Romney, who has pushed ahead in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation that he was lenient on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in his accusation that the former governor of Massachusetts had hired illegal immigrants to work on his home.
The two clashed particularly fiercely when questioners asked whether either candidate would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Less prominent candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to get their heads around the issue.
Neither man has a serious shot at the nomination, but both are staying in the race, perhaps because they hit the immigration wall sooner and harder than others.
On immigration, at least, the candidates share broadly the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal immigrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were brought up.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney argued whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the interviewers asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he might not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations, in first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When pressed on whether Jesus would endorse them, he laughed and said Jesus was too intelligent to run for political office.
The race remains unusually wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his applause in Wednesday's debate.
These two have come out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate has united the party from the ground up and convincingly with a victorious message of American greatness and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this one is not particularly slipshod.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sold, no politician's Paris hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the revelation that a wealthy businessman had hidden donations to Britain's ruling Labour Party of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years in the name of other people, and that the party had failed to report this, is something that the embattled Gordon Brown would have done well without.
When the Prime Minister two months ago refused to call for an election, foolishly insulting the intelligence of the British people by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced that decision, there was hope that he would deliver a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly astute Liberal Democrat leader of the House of Commons, put it, the once-terrible Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a struggling bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
The government has been challenged by business associations for poorly thought out proposals to change tax laws.
The tax authorities' loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative shenanigans.
A trio of retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords in protest against cuts to military spending, claiming that being Minister of the Armed Forces was a part-time job.
Now there are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and their former chief executive) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably headed for resignation.
Still, governments may reach a tipping point after which they feel unable to govern.
Neither do people trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it becomes clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he doesn't even need to be there for long, that delay is over: the public service starts to leak; the cabinet ministers start to chat; the press looks for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would deny Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction papers, for example, are tied to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's misadventure - as in the long-running "money for titles" investigation of political party funding - voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation is not quite as bad as it looks.
The wrongdoing is not as terrible as the conservatives describe it.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely swindled.
And the antidote, painful as it is, is to deliver what Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation hype is a good example.
The Garbo Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be so, but it was not his decision to make.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear, and they exist for a very clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement but didn't say it was illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labor's chief treasurer, who was told about the bizarre donations in October.
But so far Brown has not been involved: There is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He was quick to condemn the violation of the law by his party, but he watered down that determination by resorting to a familiar instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to make full measure, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "learnings to draw" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
Besides that, there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a sweeping reform of political party funding.
This would require the Labour hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a fellow party member like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some biased facts.
The Conservatives are now in clear lead in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through unchallenged integrity and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crunch infecting the American credit card market?
When blood is in water, it's only natural for the joints of the spine to swirl around in excitement.
Now that the U.S. housing market is in a slump, predators have taken aim at the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the write-off and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are either uncollectable or more than 30 days overdue.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion charge charge from its American consumer finance, in part because of the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and casualties are still low.
According to Moody's, the third-quarter unemployment rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would rise again whether or not the general conditions for creditors deteriorate.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month.
And confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stagnation in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research firm, expects final expenditure volumes for 2007 to be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt now that home loans are drying up.
However, card issuers look at cash flow rather than equity, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to the map publishers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the properties are less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much more quickly and flexibly than lenders to the more turbulent conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans completely", says Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden crisis of under-coverage in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a lasting downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit crunch push America into recession, industry will no doubt face a grimmer future.
Keep your eyes peeled for those shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to stand trial for their role in the fraud scheme with Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their plea to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud by means of telecommunications for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The proceedings were scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to a case of fraud involving telecommunications equipment.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two years of extradition proceedings.
In the United States, her case is the loose end of an investigation that was launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The original charges filed against him in 2002 alerted Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation related to the Enron debacle.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron schemes that helped to bring the company into the vortex of bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of their stake in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company controlled by Kopper acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others stole about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enron bankruptcy.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in Louisiana's federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was released on $1 million bail, which required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer disguise billions in debt or make failing businesses look profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were overturned after he died of heart disease last year.
Not all the way down to Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is small change for some of the rich Russians.
"It has room for up to 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president".
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday for the Millionaires' Fair, a four-day orgy of consumerism on display, held in a clustered exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers had set up booths, hoping to interest new money-savvy Russians in everything from mahogany-paved yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a glowing orange Porsche at the nearest booth.
"It's a nice car, but it's a pittance compared to us", he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft".
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as awash with money as Dallas was in its heyday.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in droves to Europe, where they were considered materialistic", said Marshall Goldman, a scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's most visible and generous money-spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who have a combined wealth of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are in the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study of the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a think tank here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweller.
She had visited the fair for the first time with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-dressed, and the men are all worth a fortune".
As they stroll through the halls on Sunday night in evening wear, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the newly rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian shopper who would stand in traffic for hours to visit a sprawling warehouse that shamelessly displayed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, Dubai apartments and teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best", said Mr Gijrath, who sat patriotically in front of a large Rembrandt imitation hand-painted blue mosaic stones at a booth at the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Clipper-Clipper".
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from grand logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Yet, thousands of people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires, or just tourists, crowded the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn threads of gold.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubimov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that provides high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the green-orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three cooling grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that looked like chain-linked arm tires for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner with spokes that he had coated with colored Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: 22,000 dollars for a set of four.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels", Mr Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his 30 or 40 car garage".
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" wouldn't express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash", he said.
"There are more of them than you think".
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four red British-style telephone booths, which were stuffed with piles of counterfeit million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire's fair.
Passers-by stopped to toss around the piles of money, cell phone photos as they lean back in the middle of the spare, get a snapshot from friends, or just to put in a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", said Mr. Karryev.
Suspected botched surgery in New Jersey death
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance pull up on the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the coroner's boxcar coming", Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew that someone had died".
The dead woman, the audience learned, was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who police have not identified, who worked in the home at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help to unravel a mysterious death that sent a grief note through the Newark Police Department's executive branch.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to Police Commissioner Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and persistent", Mr. McCarthy said of Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me".
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were trying to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unapproved surgical procedure.
"That's one of the ways", said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation".
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3:00 in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh would not say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if any part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the sparse front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was sitting in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes were hanging from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the provincial and tough political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to watch this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing".
Hopes that the central bank will cut interest rates lead to the rise of the world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Reserve will try to calm credit markets by further interest rate cuts were reinforced by reassuring comments from the vice chairman of the US Federal Reserve.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, Ben Bernanke's number two, the head of the central bank, said that policy had to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm fractious markets in the face of signs of emerging credit stress, Kohn said the recent turmoil had "reversed in part some of the improvements in market functioning from late September and October".
The Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the Directive to include the provision of information on the protection of consumers and businesses against risks of fraud and corruption, was adopted by the Council on 27 June.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into US markets and possible further rate cuts.
The comments also helped to calm Wall Street in the face of more bad news from the US economy, now that US property sales reached a new record low in October.
The impact of the financial turmoil was underscored by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost-cutting measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 staff.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 Index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 Index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard securities.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
The re-emergence of credit pressure on markets was underlined earlier, after strong demand for an auction of three-month European Central Bank guarantees granted to European commercial banks at a whopping 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the US central bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and pour more capital into London's money markets increased as credit tensions saw the three-month "Libor" rates for UK banks' lending rise to their highest since late September at 6.59 percent, after a continuous increase since November 21.
England faces a decision on the testimony of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 for England to beat in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the elections, is here on call, at least under this particular title, to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electorates, if not for part-time ones.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth-string position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sports are no doubt unfair.
It is never easy to pinpoint exactly what enables one person to reach the top of his profession while another never rises above the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
It's not just cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to step up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question can perhaps be asked in a wider field, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or to sink.
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but so does chance.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain at the right moment when he can take a wicket and a batsman must be given regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind is bouncing in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs apiece to earn a place in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play in Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The vote could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and was successful in the first, taking five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to establish himself, who made the breakthrough into a major Test cricketer and who, despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion in today's Asgiriya Stadium webinar, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Shah's sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and just six from Bopara, who is 22 years, seven years his junior, and an excellent record against fast bowlers speak for themselves.
But Shah scored only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord's, his home ground as a Middlesex player, and this, coupled with his immediate rejection by the selectors as Vaughan was fit to take his position back for the next match, seems to have taken the momentum out of his bat, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the Essex all-rounder has a tremendous zest for life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude of being aloof from it was highlighted when he recently overturned a four-wheel-drive vehicle at an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (which was also sponsored, of course) and call his team-mate Alastair Cook, who had been watching from afar, and say, with enthusiasm, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better outfielder, he's conning his mid-range with some effect here on the pitches, which seems to suit him and he strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean Shah might not stand a good chance, if, as the Ceylon teesap suggest, he's the one who's gonna be playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired and others hoping the city will return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan returning in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad", said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now".
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he said, referring to the militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to withdraw at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia had helped drive Al-Qaeda from its stronghold in the western part of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, by a hand grenade attack after calling on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I came back today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troop surge and the growth of local "groups of concerned citizens" who are armed and defending their neighborhoods in cooperation with the US military.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and a lack of funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed the general suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to stop issuing visas in order to force them to return to Iraq", the Sunni pensioner said.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left".
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and lead to conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest of the Länder is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
The Saarland is only one of the countries with the same deficit in education as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday I told a non-Islander for the 50th time that we are not French" - this is the slogan the smallest federal state self-ironically put up on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the Education Monitor of the Institute of German Economics (IW) in Cologne.
The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even a triple diploma.
The proportion of foreign students is correspondingly high at 15.6%.
The Saarland also sends a higher number of rural children to higher education than the average, many of them without a high school diploma.
"In the Saarland, the vocational education system is used", says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, which places the Saarland more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also comparatively large.
In terms of population, the provision of dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite the practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"We have introduced a number of reforms in the general education system after the first Pisa study", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
The government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
To help children start learning earlier, the last year of schooling is free of charge - a model that has been copied by other federal states.
Whether the pupils' performance improves in a sustainable way will be shown only by future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of at-risk students dropped from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians are better at math.
And to the Saarland's dismay, foreign language proficiency is not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise score points.
The language of the neighbours is obligatory in the gymnasium - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez is turning the clocks
Venezuela's clocks will soon be ticking differently from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez sets the clocks back half an hour in the South American country.
In Spain, Chavez is becoming a joke.
According to Venezuela's official newspaper, a new law sets clocks to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that is not found in any other country in the world.
Among other reasons, the anti-U.S. Chávez said that the United States had imposed on the world the division into time zones at full hours.
On Wednesday (local time), Chávez also announced the severing of relations with neighboring Colombia over a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not have relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this because of my dignity", said Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform that will be put to a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chavez the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe had criticized Chávez on Sunday, saying his decision "spit in the face" of Venezuela.
In Spain too, Chávez is on the go.
A new mobile phone ringing tone is causing a stir in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people from the Internet.
The European Parliament has already said that it will not be able to vote on the report, but that it will be able to vote on the report, and that it will be able to vote on the report.
German threatens 2007
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are expected to lose their real wages this year.
Experts gave a whole host of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect to receive less in real terms on their payroll in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The low wage growth, the increase in VAT and the price increases in food and energy are to blame", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Research to the Bild newspaper.
New burdens on workers could also be imposed on unemployment insurance.
The Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was, in the present situation, correct and reasonable.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system of taxation for the benefit of the general public, which would be based on the principle of equal treatment of men and women.
On Tuesday, it was revealed that the price explosion of food and petroleum products had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
The prices rose by 3.0 per cent year on year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more like Earth than previously thought: The European spacecraft Venus Express has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirlpools at the poles, just as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is a place where lightning strikes.
Now the European probe Venus Express has found evidence of electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning flashes on Venus shoot from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 35 miles, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the science magazine Nature.
According to the famous "original theory", lightning flashes gave rise to life on earth: thunderstorms are said to have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus. "If there was life there, it must have been very early in history", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly any life on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, and temperatures sometimes reach as high as 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit [500°C].
"Venus may be the devil's twin of Earth, but she's a twin", Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken on such a completely different development is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the history of Venus exploration, as no probe has been sent to the planet since the early 1990s.
The latest research, which is now being presented in several Nature articles, is not only a reminder of the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system, say the researchers.
"They also show that our neighbouring planet has more in common with Earth than previously thought", says the ESA.
So, in addition to the already known North Pole whirlwind, the researchers found a South Pole whirlwind that spins even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-closest planet in the solar system is almost as massive as the earth and almost as large, with a diameter of 7,800 miles (12,100 km).
The planet, also called the Morning Star or Evening Star, takes about 225 days to orbit the sun.
But it rotates much more slowly around itself, taking 243 Earth days to complete one day on Venus.
Although Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, is not much like Earth, scientists believe that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
On both of them, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
President Koehler wants to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's welcome at the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
President Horst Köhler, concerned about Germany's reputation, has called on the Grand Coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
The European Union is also committed to the principle of subsidiarity, which is a fundamental principle of the Treaty.
"Human rights are universal to me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures", said Köhler.
The EU's foreign policy must be balanced, he said, but Merkel was not accused of pursuing a new China policy.
"The chancellor has not departed from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows this too", said Köhler.
The German Foreign Minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD), had indirectly expressed displeasure at the Dalai Lama's reception and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
The EU's foreign policy is a "window policy" which Mr Steinmeier had criticized.
After the Dalai Lama's reception in the Chancellery, there was intense irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership has not only expelled German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, according to SPIEGEL, has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
The European Union must be able to take action to prevent the spread of the virus and to prevent the spread of the disease.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the rest of the Tibetan region, which includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, gunshots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
The European Parliament has been asked to adopt a new resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
The Commission has already adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment against the risks of pollution caused by certain substances and products.
"We must be careful not to allow social explosives to build up and become violent.
We must take this seriously", he told the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person can keep up with the rapidly changing social realities.
The Commission has already started to work on the issue of the use of the euro as a currency.
This is not just about integrating migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes are already being seen".
But it was too early to warn.
Schäuble also pointed out that German suburbs do not have the urban and sociological problems that France has.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police in the past few nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings were burned.
The chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as volatile as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under 25 years of age was "above average".
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the health of workers from the risks arising from exposure to carcinogens is a welcome one.
Kolat stressed that "we must give young people a perspective".
The chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany, more than in France, "social control takes place in the families".
Many young people from immigrant backgrounds also did not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful".
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that young people are able to participate in the labour market.
Meanwhile, the night was largely quiet in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were deployed, a helicopter flew over the area with its searchlights.
Authorities reported three arrests, a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the previous day, a contingent of about 1,000 security forces has been ensuring peace.
Police will continue to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were sparked by a traffic accident that killed two teenagers on Sunday.
According to preliminary findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the death of the youths.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The chancellor's unrealistic appearance documents that the coalition is finished in substance - and that nothing more can be expected from her.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her dismal performance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was lamentable and lacking in substance, it must be said that not here - not in the country that she should finally be governing.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she focuses too much on foreign policy with a bitterly arrogant phrase.
It was provincial, she said, and she showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has clearly documented for all to see how true her accusation is.
There was no real interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself as a sophisticated politician who escapes into foreign policy and stays out of harm's way.
The Commission is therefore proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following areas:
The self-praise - such immodesty - would have been a failure for the CDU leader two years ago.
Now she's clinging to the rhetoric that the upsurge is coming to humans.
It damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in Angela Wolke's empire, domestic problems are a peripheral issue.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low-income?
She's got a few sentences left.
It is significant how often it promises itself when it comes to the child allowance.
Merkel needs three attempts to get a half-right sentence out.
She's stumbling into unfamiliar territory when it comes to concrete.
The attack team
In the Republican presidential debate on YouTube, the two front-runners, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are fighting a hard-fought battle, and now they have to fear an outsider.
The tension between the candidates is released at the first subject.
He has made New York a "sanctuary for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani, who has been accused of employing undocumented immigrants in private, said: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants".
The candidates are blowing the whistle: Because the Republican base remains undecided, the eight vice-presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second videos that Internet users have uploaded via YouTube are little more than a hint.
"It was this kind of isolationism that got Hitler to power", John McCain accuses his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a hard-on from the Vietnam vet when he refuses to condemn what's called waterboarding, a method of interrogation that simulates drowning, as torture.
But the campaign's important issues are now beyond the Iraq war and torture debates, as the St. Petersburg, Florida, audience's reactions show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause erupts in the auditorium.
This shows once again the weaknesses of the two favourites.
"I was wrong then", says Romney, grumbling and pleading with the base and television audience that he was still an abortionist in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is stunned when asked about his view of the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilian for the first time
One day after he stepped down as army chief, Pakistan's ruling Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Eight years of military rule in Pakistan has come to an end.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to uphold the constitution and to act in the best interest of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is now ruling as a civilian head of state for the first time.
By resigning as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a key demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
Soon after his swearing in, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, fulfilling another Western demand.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had filled with lawyers who had accompanied him after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
In the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock are back
Germany's supergroup of the 1970s is back on stage: The three members of Harmonia once again took their consoles to a concert in Berlin.
Revival is releasing a recording from their heyday, Live 1974.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The supposed sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen seated at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is throne in the flower-white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Flanked on the left by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is bending his head, concentrating on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it just accidentally blends in with a conventional piece of music.
It doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen much either.
The return of the band Harmonia has caused some excitement among Krautrock fans.
But here's the thing: targeted searches revealed that the name was still in the collective pop memory, but not so long-lasting that the band has been sorely missed for 32 years.
But why should not the German celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially the misleadingly called Krautrock, which was always more popular in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for life's work to the survivor of the Cologne group Can in 2003, German pop faces were seen in the hall asking questions.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise was unbounded.
At concerts later, Michael Rother would sit on the stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the problem of deformation abroad is one.
The memory is overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio existed for only two years and during this time also developed a far less effective power than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously worked with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first, the play was held in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
After that, in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label run by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and then made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
However, around 1973, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserberg region.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as fugitive communards.
Less ideological than Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to bother as a child.
More like a two-headed artist.
The dump also allegedly contained a sheet of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing group and a name for the art.
Some of it was harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next one was called "De Luxe".
Because the music was so calm and modest, the band was in financial trouble.
The collecting of travel was not only for self-discovery.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a recording studio of about 50 people, as anyone remembers.
Rother then wanted to push Harmonia and occasionally practice.
For Roedelius and Moebius, it is an immoral demand.
The band announced their break-up in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric realm and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the '80s and has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album by Griessemer is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating the Krautrock as a distinctive German contribution to live music.
Neu! has been excavated as Roedelius's solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British hardcore punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
And there's also the inventor of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This would outline the entire range of Kraut rock's influence on subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the void left by the supergroup.
The phrase by Brian Eno is floating around the room with the most absurd sounds: "The only true music, it belongs to the future".
There are pictures of the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
The legend formation is served by projections of further black and white photographs of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are back to improvisation.
No longer by gluing microphones to the organ and drums to produce unheard sounds through the instruments' self-made effects.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tech-savvy people.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, the sound clouds are being hoisted and whispered and in a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!" is being sung.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
"68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is not dismayed by it.
Even the most obvious things are thought through on stage.
Where does music begin and end?
It can be nerve-racking or, in the case of a fleeting moment, a source of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
The Hunting Party and Murder Peace are two more films about the Balkan War.
But neither convinces.
Either the concepts are too much about action and plot or they are too emotional.
Richard Gere in The Hunting Party can't help that.
The good news first: while the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely there, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s because of too many rather insignificant roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism that made you want to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the main argument, maybe you should watch "The Hunting Party" (Why do movie titles today have to be so long and confusing like train driver's collective agreements?)
He delivers a wonderfully eye-catching portrayal of his war correspondent, Simon Hunt, who is essentially what Gere might have become if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful: a man whose best days are long behind him, but who has retained considerable remnants of his former charm as a ruinous monument to his downfall.
But despite this triumph, The Hunting Party, along with the German production of Murder Peace, which also opens this week, continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
"Mörderischer Frieden" is a short film about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian woman from Kosovar snipers, and the latter falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evil, the television film is too quickly lost in gossip and action.
It's still a sort of "Cobra 11 alert" without the highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is a good example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three US war reporters going to track down the Serbian war criminal "the Fox" could have been a new "Apocalypse Now" in another time with a different director and a different screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's union).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times, small teams go into the woods to do something that the military can't do, and both times, it's a journey into madness.
One of the reasons that "The Hunting Party" failed is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the down-and-out heartless cynic that he's introduced to us in the beginning.
No, the script must have also suggested a romantic relationship with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party will finally go down the drain if the reporters can, in the last five minutes, in a timed process, do what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and let the Muslim Bosnians do their justice.
It is so bad that you want to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film is deeply human.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects that the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree on an exceptional occasion) are not pursuing the persecution too intensively due to secret political collusion.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says of the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's workbench: "I sympathetically see the swollen eyelids, suggesting how exhausting it is to be evil".
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same swell heads, but they hint at how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all of Iraq's Hollywood movies were big flops.
You might add that there has never been a good South African film.
Almost always, when a star is floundering around the world's crisis hotspots or minefields, it's something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond the Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it would be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably mature - the now classical Vietnamese works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were not universally hailed as masterpieces in their time.
But perhaps we know too much today about where every mass murderer is coming home in real time on two screens, and just too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the screenwriters of the recklessness that's needed to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need the sarcastically distant artistic gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières' Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust is criticized for Olympic boycott
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with fierce criticism from politicians and businessmen.
Many want to continue fighting for the water games.
But it is important to be realistic in assessing the chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, said on Wednesday that a waiver was "not good for the business community".
No other project has recently unleashed such motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the momentum of sport policy could not be sustained to the same extent".
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it "that starts from a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday maintained his previous statement that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation", von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports federation on a bid of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, expected for the beginning of December.
"This preference means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period until 2028 that we have envisaged so far".
However, the dream was not to be dismissed forever, said Mr von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beust.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will not be competing in the Olympics for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to take a chance by burying the plans at this stage", HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
The rejection of the application also contradicts the statement of the head of the Senate at a reception for the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
The Commission has not yet received the request for a decision on the application of the Hamburg application for the Universiade 2015 as a replacement for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports federation had just nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The Socialist Party's Citizens' Group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put its Olympic spirit on the map and has left out housing", said SPD MEPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
The SPD had always called for integrated planning for the Olympia and future use of the building for the Kleine Grasbrook, whereas the CDU had unilaterally placed its bets on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics had caused great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed at Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
When you think of Sweden and wooden box, you think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At present, Swedish-made wooden boxes cast a dark shadow on Warhol's catalogue of works.
The majority of the 94 Brillo boxes of the 'Stockholm type' listed there are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo boxes a few months ago, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering conclusion: the six Brillo boxes that the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies - and probably most of the other hundred or so Brillo boxes from the "Type Stockholm" that are on sale on the international art market.
The prehistory is interlocking, a confusing interlocking of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first Brillo boxes in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the Brillo soap powder cardboard.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these did not come from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
They were not works of art, but models of them, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, but not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at that time were authorized original Andy Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm" have rightly entered the history of art and auction.
Some of them have made over $100,000 at auctions.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, has examined not only the six museum-owned Brillo boxes but also three private Swedish boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first ground and lubricated, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, shows that the paint was applied directly to the pressed pan without a coating by means of a paint roller - and it is not an oil paint but an acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve. "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York reaches a different conclusion, Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material".
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious allegations" made in connection with the soap-box case.
But since then, the place has been shrouded in unrelenting silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had taken refuge in a hotel in Manila and called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
He cannot be held responsible for any bloodshed, leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government troops had earlier stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen or so soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to sit down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to be guarding him apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the ouster of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops have sealed off the area around the luxury hotel.
The president has called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales has condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"The people have had enough", said Trillanes.
"We call on the people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the elite Scout Rangers unit, said other army units were planning to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
In 2003, the financial district of Manila was the scene of an attempted mutiny by some 200 military personnel against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after less than 24 hours due to the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20% in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, the company said on Wednesday evening.
The company now holds 20.05% of the share capital.
A takeover had been speculated about before.
The option of increasing the proportion of Versatel is still open.
The move is aimed at consolidating the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, speculation had already arisen about a move after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by a further 5% to 15.1%.
The bank only holds the shares for a third party, it was said on the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already bought a 10% stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares of the company for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have entered into discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies have set up the joint venture MSP to take over competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for a stake of just over 10 percent in Freenet and not exercise their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies, however, remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had been concluded in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is still difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile subscribers and 1.27 million DSL and full-line subscribers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held 6.01 percent of the shares of Freenet directly.
It was agreed that Drillish would contribute another four per cent.
The right to buy the 18,49% stake in the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
