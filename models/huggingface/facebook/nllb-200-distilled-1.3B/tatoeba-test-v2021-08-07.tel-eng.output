A cat came out from under the desk.
Ah! How beautiful is the Taj Mahal!
How quiet this temple is!
How is the stomach?
Emmitt! Is this true?
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you mad?
Are you willing to do this?
Are you still afraid of what might happen?
As far as I know, he is not married yet.
What time do I have to get to the station?
Oh, my God!
Bananas are delicious.
Get some tea now!
Bring some tea.
Brush your teeth daily
Can I use your phone?
Did you see that?
The nearest bus stop is somewhere.
Children love cake
Come, I'll give you some too
Of course
Did all this really happen?
Did you do your homework yesterday?
Do not hesitate to ask me for help.
Don't interfere with my work.
Is there anything else to say about that?
Do you know why he's so angry?
Do you live around here?
Do you tiffany before you're seven?
Give this book to Ram.
Give it to Ram.
Go there tomorrow!
Go there.
Happy International Women's Day! The day is marked by the celebration of the International Women's Day.
Lata came from school?
Is Lata here?
Is it a red rose?
What is the meaning of the name "rose"?
Did you do your homework?
Did you do your homework?
Have you ever been to Paris?
Have you ever had a heart attack?
Did you do your homework?
Have you eaten?
He did not keep his word
He was clothed like a woman.
He earns three times as much as I do.
He had two pencils, one long and one short.
He put it
He is Ram.
He teaches Spanish to children
Help came too late
He made a bookshelf for her.
The steam has long arms and legs
He's our boy.
He took revenge
He touched me.
The game is not only a great cowboy but also a good doctor
And he washed his hands of the blood .
Shall we go out to eat tonight?
How are you coming?
How are you?
How are you?
How did you put this doll?
How many mangoes do you want?
How many mangoes do you want?
Are you okay?
How tall is she?
Is the work I said done?
I started talking.
I can't keep you here much longer.
I don't like coffee.
I make mistakes too.
I do not agree.
I don't have time to talk right now.
I don't know where they are.
I don't know who won.
I don't need anything.
I don't speak Japanese.
I don't believe him
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I drank coffee.
I heard the bell ring.
I heard you were sick.
I know you'll tell me no.
I'll be very careful.
I'll leave this time.
I'll start swimming very soon.
I'll get off at the next stop.
I'm hungry again.
I am learning Burmese.
I'm not allowed to do that here.
I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
I'm really sorry about last night.
I know he's coming.
I usually do that.
I never saw him.
I ran home.
I realized that you are my brother.
Are you okay?
I should have been able to do it all by myself.
Emmitt! Is this true?
Is there any good water there?
Is the work done?
Is it Chinese or Japanese? Is it Korean?
My advice to you is to do that.
Did you do your homework?
Did you do your homework?
It's not that easy.
I thought it was useless.
It is difficult to speak English well
It may take all afternoon or longer
What good is it to call them that?
It's time to leave for school, isn't it?
It's not all your fault.
It is very valuable.
It is clear that there is no other way
It's not my fault.
I made a mistake, even if it wasn't my intention.
I've never been to Japan.
It hit me.
I wouldn't go there today if I were you.
Two birds with one stone
Lalita has invited me to the wedding.
Lalita called.
Let him stay there.
Let us take that opportunity.
Mary bought a fake purse.
Mary bought a new dress for the party.
Mary had lied to you, but she didn't tell you.
Mary was devastated when she heard Tom say that.
Mary's boyfriend threatened to leave her.
The next morning, the family was in the kitchen.
Please don't give me any more coffee.
My bag is nowhere to be seen.
My computer is expensive.
My father is not at home right now.
My father sleeps with a telescope.
I have a headache.
We were playing tennis there.
Who did not come?
I'm not the only one to blame.
Is that true?
Is that true?
What a surprise!
Oh, my God!
Oh, Raju fell down the stairs!
The elderly walk slowly
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Only animal products contain fat.
Beyond sight, beyond the mind.
People believe that God exists.
Ram came to the school.
Ram has arrived.
Ram came to the school.
It's an evening study.
It's an evening study.
This is education.
He asked how many languages I spoke.
She was breathing cold air.
He had no children.
She refused to say anything more.
She sits on the table.
The steam scared the cat away.
She's not a doctor.
He is no longer near the house.
She has been teaching music for thirty years.
She was on her way to school.
She was terrified.
Show me where it hurts.
Sita smiled beautifully.
Sita smiled.
Sitting all day is not good for you
Some dogs survive
Tell me about your daily life.
Thank you for welcoming me.
The boy is a little monster.
That's a party.
It sounds very interesting.
It's not that easy, you know.
Sin cried out loud.
Sin cried.
The caterpillar cries for milk
Today is not over yet.
The movie is about to begin.
Shabaash! The doll is good!
There are islands in the sea.
There is nothing to fear.
There is nothing left.
These pencils are the same color
These socks don't stick when washed.
The station is nearby
The work is almost done.
They are animals.
They sing a song.
That is a very stupid question.
It was while I was eating a banana.
It's not a sentence.
I was very hurt.
This plant has some burnt leaves
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Tom washed his hands of the lust.
Tom washed his glasses with hot soapy water and rubbed them on the cloth.
Tom was very scared.
Is it really that bad?
It is better to leave him alone
We did it on purpose.
We don't understand French.
We didn't sleep for days.
Shabhash, you put this toy well!
We need money to do what we want to do.
We should hire trustworthy ones
We played basketball yesterday.
We must get rid of him.
We want to hear
What are you doing tomorrow, Tom?
What are you saying?
What were you talking about?
What did you talk about.
What else do I have to lose?
The game is meaningless.
How much is the book?
What time is it now?
Emmitt! Is this true?
What's in the box?
What time is it now?
What's your room number?
How long has it been?
What do you take?
When did you stop smoking?
When will Sita go?
When will you come from Vijayawada?
When will you come back?
You'll understand when you're my dad.
Where did you put my book?
Where is Mary?
Where's your boy?
Music speaks where words cannot.
What color do you like, blue or purple?
What's your pen?
Who are we?
Why didn't you make it.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
Why can't giraffes sing?
Why did you call me?
Why did you lie to her?
She answered the door as her heart beat.
The error
You can do it.
Is that right?
You are fat.
You can eat lunch here in this room.
You don't have to be ashamed.
You must come once.
You can go swimming or fishing.
You need to speak up.
Stay where you are.
You seem very happy.
You came so soon.
