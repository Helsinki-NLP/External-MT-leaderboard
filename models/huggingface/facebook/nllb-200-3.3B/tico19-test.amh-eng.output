The overall incidence rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was increasing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) from January 1-March 15, 2020.
The overall incidence rate of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, which confirms that the global COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries, although at different rates depending on the country.
As a result of Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness in anticipation of a sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a novel coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that 80% of COVID-19 patients have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
In 14% of cancer cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more severe stage requiring hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% of cases, severe illness requiring intensive medical care is observed.
The mortality rate among hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assess the overall incidence trend of COVID-19 in each of the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to the Chinese province of Hubei.
We have now compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK with the number of cases in Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK
COVID-19 has spread from China to more geographic regions, and the current COVID-19 outbreak in the world is concentrated in the country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a global pandemic.
Spiteri et al., writing in the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, reported the first European confirmed cases of COVID-19 according to the WHO case definition.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported on January 24/2020 in France, and were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been reported in all 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2020, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Knowing the total number of COVID-19 cases and the overall incidence
The COVID-19 case numbers reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in each country worldwide are derived exclusively from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, and are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK and to compare them with Italy.
Since the presence of active COVID-19 cases is representative, we have calculated the 14-day overall incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area country and the UK from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
In addition, we have also presented the number of cases reported in each country as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, compared to the situation in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trend of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK over a 14-day period of total incidence was followed by the province of Hubei (China) as a whole (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall increase in COVID-19 cases began around February 21 and then increased sharply around February 28/2020 (source).
This was largely due to the rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supporting material).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, compared to the total number of cases in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
As of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have recorded a total number of cases that compares to Italy's 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases has increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK.
Trends in the overall incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the global epidemic is increasing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is happening at different stages of the disease, with differences in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions and protocols in different countries for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in the Italian provinces affected by the virus reported that 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and that hospitals and intensive care units in these provinces had reached capacity limits, according to media sources.
The current EU/EEA standard for data on COVID-19 cases treated in hospital and/or intensive care unit is only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not available).
However, they should be collected in a systematic way to strengthen the up-to-date monitoring data, which focuses on reported cases and deaths.
A 2010 study showed that there was a large gap between ready-to-use high-level surveillance beds and standard beds in Europe, from 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds per 100,000 population in intensive care and medium-level care, 2010 vs. 2011).
The estimated number of hospital-acquired COVID cases for each EU/EEA country and the UK, with more than 90 cases of acute hospitalization, related to the combination of the health support capacity of the model conditions, is given in the sixth ECDC update on COVID-19 assessment.
As group cases are also found in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are often reserved for a specific population, the data for cases and intensive care beds should be reported at the statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience from Italy and other trends in other countries show that the global COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the continuous spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and the increased need for health care, especially for COVID-19 patients requiring intensive medical care, as seen in the Italian regions affected by the virus.
As suggested in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid and comprehensive approach to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in case numbers if not implemented early on does not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt to responses.
Rapid risk assessment limits community health measures, which are intended to reduce the impact of the global pandemic.
The window of opportunity for countries to further scale up their containment efforts to reduce the burden on health care by slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is short.
Otherwise, health care systems in other EU/EEA countries will be overwhelmed in the coming days or weeks with patients who need urgent medical attention.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has so far killed more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, and has caused more than 3,000 deaths, making it a human plague.
Similar to the same virus SARS-CoV that infected thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms in the same way.
However, although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, it has a higher incidence and affects older men more than younger men and more women.
With the rapid increase in the number of papers being published on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide an updated and comprehensive overview of the rapidly growing research project.
We cover the basics of the disease, including epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope this discovery will help to understand and eliminate the threat of a devastating disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, was a memorable event for all Chinese people, as a new viral disease caused by a new virus, prompted the Chinese to stay indoors during and after the festival.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (Cov) that caused severe respiratory syndrome in 2003, so on 11/February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2, and the variant disease was named COVID-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country, reaching nearly 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, more than 40,000 patients have been discharged, and more than 3,000 have died.
As WHO warns, COVID-19 is the No. 1 public enemy and has the potential to do more damage than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report was published on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, pathology, and treatment, and they have been devoted to sequencing viruses isolated from various patients.
This survey attempts to summarize the results of the research on a new and rapidly changing topic of study.
To the extent possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another COVID-related disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
we will discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the history of the disease, as well as some remaining but pressing questions.
CoVs are generally considered non-lethal human pathogens, and are the primary cause of about 15% of influenza IV cases.
However, we have had two pandemic CoVs in this century (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), both of which first appeared in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, before spreading rapidly to many other countries and causing horrific disease and death rates.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV pandemic in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1, the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China on 31/2019.
Seven days later, Cove's successor was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in the water.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, states, and countries.
On 20 January, healthcare providers were reported to have been infected with the virus, which was an indicator of human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, all public transportation in Wuhan was shut down and the city was completely closed.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease showed that of 41 patients with a confirmed case, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is thought to be the point of origin of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the pandemic an urgent global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread to China and about 50 other countries (Figure 2).2)
The situation is changing rapidly, so the final extent and severity of the pandemic will be determined in the future.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study was conducted on 8,866 patients, of which 4,021 were confirmed COVID-19 patients with the latest outbreak (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but primarily those aged 30-65.
Half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, with a very small number under 20 years old, and only 14 cases were under 10 years old.
The number of men infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000) is higher than that of women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was mainly spread in and around Hubei.
On average, it takes 5 (2-9) days from the date of infection to be diagnosed with COVID-19.
The average incubation period for a person infected with the virus is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13).
The baseline reproductive index (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05); the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases increased significantly before 23 January 2020, which is the time of transportation related to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three primary risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of broad-band viruses that contain a single strand of RNA.
They can be divided into four general classes: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans.
Envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and subsequently forms a tissue-to-cell fusion.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is folded, the genomic RNA and envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form an intracellular or extracellular body containing the virus, which is then released into the plasma tissue.
The first preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of beta-CoV and more than 99.98% of the 10 samples collected from the Hunan seafood market, in the waters where the outbreak originally occurred, showed a genetic similarity.
SARS-CoV-2 has more of a genome similarity to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 microorganisms were detected in the thinnest parts of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 has a weaker binding to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is related to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is secreted by Novel's short protein orf3b and secreted by the orf8 protein.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ, however, orf8 has no known functional domain or causative agent.
On February 18, 2020, Xu and colleagues reported that the human ACE2 full-length crystal EM structure is 2.9 Å resolution, which is a carrier of the amino acid B0AT1 complex.
The closed-loop and proof-of-concept complex was reassembled as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex was shown to bind two S proteins, providing evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 could be a potential therapeutic target for drug screening to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Source and distributor host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via mice and camels, respectively.
Based on a comparison of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were assumed to be the primary hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus had a 96% similarity to two SARS-like CoVs derived from bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate vector that allows the virus to cross genetic boundaries to infect humans has not yet been identified, and the route of transmission is still being investigated.
According to the team, the virus was transmitted from bats to humans by a snake, which requires recombination with the S protein.
In one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, identified pangolins, long-nosed, ant-eating mammals that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on 99% genetic similarity between the CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% variation distribution in both genomes is itself a large variation, and therefore, concrete results are awaited for a conclusive proof (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a dry environment for up to 48 hours and up to 5 days in a temperature below 20 °C and humidity of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperature at 56 °C for 30 days; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated antiseptic, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other greasy solvents, excluding chlorhexidine, can effectively neutralize the virus.
The general population is vulnerable to the new virus due to the weak resistance to SARS-CoV-2.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 foreign invader virus.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other covers, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after a virus has invaded the host, it is first recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) running on the host's immune system, including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
The virus uses several pathways to cause inflammation of the body, destruction of antigen-presenting cells, synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) and restricts viral transmission by accelerating viral antigen macrophage phagocytosis.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape the immune system.
Soon, a targeted immune response will join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a critical role in the immune response.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune system.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by accelerating T cell death.
Fluid-derived immunity such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also critical to preventing viral infections.
For example, the antibodies identified in the recovered patient rendered MERS-CoV useless.
on the other hand, when the immune system overreacts, it produces large amounts of free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, disabling various organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to attack elderly people and pregnant women with various diseases.
It is common for people who have been exposed to high levels of viruses or who have weakened immune systems to be more susceptible to infection than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with a peak incubation period of 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in aquatic animals.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As noted above, the most recent study, based on demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed a virus incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It will be important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate breeding season, and in doing so prevent people who are infected but do not show symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a standard procedure, individuals who are exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to remain in isolation for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The primary and first symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which may be either unnoticed or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or reduced oxygen levels in the blood from the day of onset.
In severe cases, patients may develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy early.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened for early detection of the virus, even if they do not have a problem with imaging.
A demographic survey conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of patients with symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory support.
Similar findings were reported in recent studies of two family groups and a group of infected individuals who were not showing symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of COVID-19 patients required ventilation more often, considering the higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat ulcers (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, with 14%-20% of patients requiring respiratory support.
On 14 February, the COVID-19 death rate stood at 2%, and the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576 at that time.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to a demographic study conducted for Maers, June 2012, among 2,494 confirmed cases, the mortality rate was 37%.
Initial local studies showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high at 6.47 and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV based on the symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but a lower lethality than both.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more challenging than controlling MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Group infection often occurs in the same family or in the same group or in a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas in the two weeks prior to the condition, or have had direct contact with individuals or patients with the virus.
However, the fact that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms and that patients who have been discharged from hospital can carry the virus again may be a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages of the disease, patients have a normal or decreased white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphocyte count with white blood cell count; 4×109/L; lymphocyte count including lymphocyte count; 1×109/L high aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
In some patients, there was an increase in liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, while in most patients, there was an increase in C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In patients with persistent cases, the amount of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, is increased and the number of immune-mediated white blood cells is progressively reduced.
In most COVID-19 patients, chest radiography results showed a health issue, characterized by a swelling on both sides or blurred areas in the lungs.
Patients usually have regular pneumonia, severe lung damage and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled swelling, fluid buildup, and increased scar tissue can cause significant problems with gas exchange.
Type-I and type-II alveolar cells decrease lipid and protein synthesis, increasing stress, causing lung strain and increasing the risk of stroke.
Thus, the worst chest radiography findings are usually associated with the worst case of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 showed the presence of pneumocytes damage, hyaline tissue formation, lung infiltration, and lung tissue from a patient who had died from the disease, which is consistent with the viral infection and ARDS epidemiological analysis and is similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a laboratory technique called reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has served as a critical criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the increasing number of false negatives, which hastened the spread of the epidemic, clinical serotonics (which are no longer exclusively based on RT-PCR) were introduced in China on 13 February 2020.
The same thing happened with SARS.
Therefore, the combination of medical history, clinical exams, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is critical to an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group developed a protocol for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dipstick in less than one hour without the need for additional equipment.
We hope that the new technique, if it can be confirmed in clinical samples, will greatly increase sensitivity and comfort.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, physicians can only provide supportive care for COVID-19 and will also test various therapies previously used or proposed to treat other covers and other viral diseases, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Table (Table.2).2)
these include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients, chinese medicine, and psychologically assisted treatment and future treatments.
Plasma from patients recovering from the disease was suggested for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to produce antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs in the first place, with smaller amounts of other body parts such as the digestive system and kidneys, which produce ACE2.
However, respiratory failure and stroke are the main concerns of patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives: total oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, intravenous ventilation, and mechanical ventilation are included in the weight of the patient.
Patients with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should be treated with extracorporeal tissue oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory arrest.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, and maintaining vital organ function are critical for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storms are known to be caused by overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a systemic immune response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytotoxins cause the disease-preventing cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which cause ARDS and organ failure.
Immunosuppression is critical for treating cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe disease.
anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids and tosylizumab have been used to treat cytopenic storm.
Other treatments for cytokine shock include stimulation of T cell-targeted immune responses; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blainatumobumab; cytokine signaling inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the risk of human disease.
However, steroids administered in high doses are of little help in reducing severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can have serious side effects, especially bone tissue loss, and can seriously affect prognosis of disease progression.
However, low to moderate short-term corticosteroid administration is recommended for COVID-19 patients who are stable.
At the time of writing, effective antiviral therapy has not yet been proven to exist.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been shown to be effective in one US COVID-19 patient who was administered intravenously.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally intended to treat infections caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir was shown to inhibit the activity of single RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Accordingly, Gilead delivered the compound to China so that it could conduct the combined tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as therapeutic agents for patients with symptomatic acute respiratory illness.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur with lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction between these therapies and other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
the practice of taking blood from people who have recovered from infectious disease to treat people with the same disease or to prevent the infection of healthy individuals has a long history.
of course, patients who recover from the disease have a high level of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes that fight pathogens and other foreign substances, and also directly neutralize them by identifying specific molecules in the pathogens.
Accordingly, plasma was taken from the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients who were critically ill.
their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with a decrease in inflammation and viral load, as well as improved blood oxygenation.
However, until specific therapies are developed, validation and activation are necessary to recommend a method for large-scale use.
In addition, some plasma-related injuries should be treated with caution, taking into account the therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can block the immune response and cause the life-threatening cytokine-like syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat patients with severe disease is high.
It is difficult to rapidly develop and produce specific antibodies that have the potential to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract B cells from recovering patients and isolate the genetic codes needed to produce effective antibodies or to filter critical viral proteins into effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, the effects are mainly due to the combination of different components in a single formula, which varies according to the TCM treatment and the disease.
Most of the effective components remained unknown or ambiguous, because it was difficult to identify and verify such components or their composition.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from severe disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du pills and the Lian Hua Qing Wen pills have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The survival rate for COVID-19 patients was highest in several provinces in China that used TCM on 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Nianxia (50%), and Hunan (50%). The province of Hubei, which used TCM only on about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest survival rate (13%) of all provinces.
however, this comparison is shallow, as many other influencing factors, such as the number of patients and the degree of disease, are involved in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time it takes for the body temperature to recover, the time it takes for the symptoms to subside, and the time it takes to be hospitalized were significantly reduced in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM-only group.
Most surprisingly, the rate of progression of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) than in the WM-only group; the rate of mortality was also lower in the WM+TCM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM will depend on the results of larger, more controlled trials in many centers.
It may also be of interest to describe the steps and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or, if possible, their combination.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are more afraid of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and those in isolation feel isolated, lonely and angry.
In addition, infection symptoms and treatment side effects such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, various mental health challenges were reported, including persistent dizziness, anxiety, panic attacks, mental breakdown, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and suicidal ideation.
Mandatory contact monitoring and quarantine, one of the community health responses to preventing the COVID-19 outbreak, may cause people to feel anxious and guilty about the impact of the pandemic, quarantine, and isolation from family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and their contacts and for those in general need.
The range of psychological support provided should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, the clear transmission of regular and accurate up-to-date information on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid contact with each other.
In addition to effective vaccines being critical to break the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected humans to vulnerable hosts, antiviral therapy is also helpful in controlling outbreaks caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines that can permanently strengthen antibodies and/or immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines developed from pathogenic viruses have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these candidate vaccines in elderly people and their efficacy in the presence of a reduced lethality model and a zoonotic virus should be determined before clinical trials begin.
This may be because the incidence of SARS decreased 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, the MERS-CoV transmission rate in the Middle East region continued to expand significantly, with animal-to-human transmission in existing areas and spread to other regions.
Immobile viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like materials and laboratory-created protein subunits have been used to develop vaccination strategies for MERS, some of which have been tested in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, the long time required to produce a vaccine (average 18 months) and the volatile nature of the CoVs make it challenging to address the problem.
COVID-19 is a new disease, and it has only just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
in most cases, patients recover gradually without any adverse effects.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 can cause severe morbidity and mortality in critically ill people.
Therefore, it is critical to build a growth prediction model for this disease so that healthcare agencies can streamline their services, especially in areas with a shortage of patients.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following cases may be related to or have been associated with the history of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the history of SARS, and this is also true for COVID-19.
As noted above, 47.7% of patients aged 50 years and above were found to have COVID-19 primarily in the age group 30-65 years, based on a study of 8,866 cases.
The fact that patients requiring intensive medical care are older than those with pre-existing conditions and health problems and no pre-existing health problems (mean age 66 versus 51 years) suggests that age is a predictive factor for COVID-19 patients' chances of recovery.
Gender: As noted above, SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 males; 0.27/100,000 females).
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive medical care are more likely to develop severe cardiovascular disease and respiratory failure.
Heart disease-related complications are the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is reportedly associated with ACE2-positive cholangiocytes and may cause liver health problems in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and preexisting disease are highly correlated and one can interfere with the other.
unhealthy laboratory findings: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the level of inflammation or tissue damage, and it was proposed to be used to determine the natural history of the disease, the response to therapy and the final recovery process.
A correlation between the CRP dose and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may help to predict the outcome.
these enzymes are highly expressed in various organs of the body, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Thus, heart or liver health problems are common symptoms.
The main clinical symptoms, chest radiography and duration of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other factors to predict the outcome of COVID-19 and health problems.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are commonly prescribed as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the risk of human immunodeficiency and respiratory damage.
With the widespread use of high-dose corticosteroids in patients with SARS, many survivors experienced bone cell death, permanent disability and a lower standard of living.
Therefore, steroids should be used in small doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Anxiety: As mentioned above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic have experienced high levels of anxiety and uncertainty due to prolonged isolation, the death of close family members and other patients.
psychological counseling and ongoing support are essential to help these patients recover from depression and return to a normal life.
According to the current demographic studies, COVID-19 has a different mode of transmission from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates in the upper respiratory tract, causing no or minimal symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other influenza-causing CoVs.
Therefore, people who are infected in the first phase or the incubation period may produce large amounts of virus from their daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, it has been shown that SARS-CoV is transmitted when patients are critically ill and most transmission does not occur in the early stages of the disease.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 pandemic is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS pandemic.
Massive efforts are being made in China to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including a complete restriction of movement in Wuhan and surrounding cities and placing the general population under quarantine.
While these measures are severely damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the decline in the number of new cases indicates a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most pessimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end in March and the rate of transmission will decrease in 3-4 months.
However, other experts are less optimistic.
According to Paul Hunter, COVID-19, which is more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
and Ira Longini developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reports that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in nasal and throat samples from patients who have been discharged from hospital for two weeks, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be as frequent as the flu.
However, there are some promising signs in China as the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that current strategies are not going to be as effective.
Ebola was originally estimated to cause half a million deaths, with up to one million cases recorded.
However, due to strict control and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can become weak and lethal in the process, or it can become a weaker virus that co-exist with humans and cause disease.
A comparison between the COVID-19 outbreak and SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through the bite or sneeze, as well as through direct contact with infected materials.
The virus was also found in the feces, suggesting that it could be transmitted from the feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases found that 41% of cases were probably caused by infection in one location, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, extreme precautions must be taken to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and those who come into contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defence that we can use to reduce the risk of infection is to make face masks; wearing surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (brand number 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent the droplets from an infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to surfaces of material to prevent them from being passed on to other people.
However, only N95 (code 1860s) masks are able to resist the inhalation of viruses ranging in size from 10 to 80 nm; only 5% of viruses are fully inhalable; SARS-CoV-2 is somewhat similar to SARS-CoV, both of which are approximately 85 nm.
Since surgical masks can be stacked and even hidden, and small objects can be introduced, health care providers who have direct contact with patients should not wear N95 (product number 1860s) and surgical masks.
Healthcare providers should wear a self-contained gown in addition to masks to minimize contact with the virus.
viruses can infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor wore an N95 mask and was infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus may have entered the body through the infected eye.
Therefore, healthcare workers should wear transparent face masks or masks when working with patients.
For the general population living in affected or vulnerable areas, it is recommended that everyone wash their hands with soap and water more than usual, stay home and avoid contact with people who are at risk of infection.
the distance between people and the patient is three feet.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus to the human world, its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a major wake-up call in the face of the severe memory of the SARS outbreak in China in 2003.
However, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center had waited until January 19, 2020, to console the public, stating that the new virus is low in human-to-human transmission, has a low reproduction rate, and is not difficult to prevent and control.
This message has greatly increased the alertness of the population, especially as the whole country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and it has saved the critical time to control the disease while it is still at a low level in the water.
Disease control agencies in China can take this hard lesson and make robust improvements for the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public statements because citizens value every word and can change their opinions and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or administrators; (3) be more vigilant to prevent an outbreak from occurring in the first place rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) be more timely in delivering targeted and effective training activities that allow the public to better understand epidemics and improve community response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
in less than two months, it was distributed throughout china and, at the time of writing, in some 50 countries.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of SARS reoccurring.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are critical to controlling the outbreak and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more often than younger people, men more often than women, and the severity and mortality rate are higher in older people than in young people.
The death rate from SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients transmit the virus mostly during the acute stage of the disease, making the spread of COVID-19 more difficult to control than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.
The standard RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, rescued patients may be re-positive.
These findings greatly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
As research on COVID-19 is progressing rapidly, several critical issues need to be addressed, including:
where did sars-cov-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS CoVs has been found, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal species was the first carrier of the virus, from a bats, to humans, and was the most aggressive in the process?
Without the answers to No. 1 and No. 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread, and the pandemic could strike at any time.
Although the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 has been demonstrated by molecular modeling and biochemical tests, how does the virus enter the airways and cause disease?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 receptor cells in other parts of the body?
without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the genetic makeup show up during transmission of the virus from person to person?
Will it be a global pandemic, will it bite like SARS, or will it be seasonal like the flu?
it is vital to seek answers to these and many other questions, but it may take some time.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
The origin of the coronaviruses
The adaptation and change of the coronavirus and its carriers, including humans, has been the basis for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human covers (HCVs) were found to cause mild, flu-like illness.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown that HCV infection is both destructive and life-threatening.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has again brought cows to the forefront and has surprised us with its high transmissibility, but its pathogenicity is reduced compared to its cousin SARS-CoV.
As hcov disease is a zoonotic disease, understanding the zoonotic sources of hcov is of great benefit.
Many HCoVs are from bats, and they are not pathogenic in them.
They are also known as medium-major carriers of some echovchs.
Identifying vector animals is directly related to the prevention of human infections.
Examining covid-carrier interactions in animals may also provide valuable insights into the pathogenicity of covid in humans.
In this review, we present the information on the seven HCoVs, their history of discovery, and a summary of existing information, focusing on their main origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we will compare and compare different EHCOVs based on viral genome and genome recombination.
The current Covid-19 pandemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, criteria for successful carrier exchanges and viral physiology implications on disease severity were also suggested.
The coronavirus belongs to the coronavirus family, a group of viruses that includes the positive and single RNA viruses.
These viruses have larger genomes than RNA viruses, ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases, and were named by Zhukovsky because their structure resembles a crown under electron microscopy.
There are genomes that share the same structure, not divided by the level of covetation.
Approximately two-thirds of the virus strain contains two large open leukocytes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which produce multiple proteins called pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotons are continuously arranged to form 16 distinct non-spondin proteins, the specific nsp1~16.
The rest of the class comprises ORFs, which combine spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleotide (N) for the protein structure.
Several variable protein stem cells are also recorded in various Covech stem cells.
Based on the differences in protein sequence, the covers are divided into four categories (alpha-cov, beta-cov, gamma-cov, and delta-cov); of these, the beta-cov genus contains the most echov, and is further divided into five subgenic groups (A, B, C, and D).
Genetic evidence shows that bats and rat mites serve as a genetic source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are a major reservoir for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, covchics have repeatedly crossed the breeding line. And some of them have been implicated as a major cause of human disease.
There are seven known human-causing HCoVs so far.
Among these are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, both alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-covs that are infected are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are the most commonly associated with mild symptoms such as influenza and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the recently isolated SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections in a small number of patients, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first HCoV-229E specimen, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of influenza patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, several breakthroughs have been made in the extensive research on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
Indeed, the idea that infections from E. coli are harmless in general until SARS emerges has been widely accepted.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was the worst in recent history, killing more than 8,000 people, with 10% of them in the most severe form.
A decade later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak had repeatedly occurred in the Arabian Peninsula and quickly spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), also known as Sars-CoV-2, is the cause of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has infected more than 91,000 people and killed more than 3,120 people as of March 3, 2020.
The world must prepare for the impending SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as the alarm is being sounded.
The seven echovchs are from a night bird, a rat, or a domestic animal.
Most of the data support the hypothesis that all HCoVs originate from bats, which is where the viruses are most adapted and do not cause disease, but still shows a large genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Studying the source of the covch suggests a theme of natural history, the underlying motives and the limitations of species dispersal.
This could guide or facilitate the detection of primary, intermediate and host carriers of SARS-CoV-2 with important recommendations in preventing future spread.
In this survey, we provide an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission, and causes of HCV disease.
In particular, we will discuss the topic of the unrelated HCoV viruses, which we should highlight and highlight in their natural habitat, they become weaker as they are transmitted to a new host, but become pathogenic after transmission.
We also examine the evolutionary tendency of HCoV, where increased susceptibility is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The implications of the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed in this context.
Animal coves have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the initial detection of HCoV-229E B814 in the nasal cavities of influenza patients, various strains of the virus were identified in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last decade, seven Echkovs have been discovered.
The main idea of the story of Chekhov's discovery is clearly laid out in Table 1.
The first HCoV-229E strain of upper respiratory infection was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients in 1966, and subsequently grown in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E and influenza infections, including headache, vomiting, pain, and sore throat, have been reported with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
In 1967, the spread of HCoV-OC43 was isolated in a series of cells in the physiological system and brain of a domestic mouse.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 disease are similar to those of infections caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be distinguished from other respiratory infections such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses, due to their asymptomatic nature.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide, and are most commonly found in winters when the weather is cold.
The time to onset of symptoms for both viruses is generally less than one week, followed by two weeks of illness.
According to a study of two volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild influenza.
Very few immunocompromised patients have developed severe lower respiratory illness.
SARS, also known as SARS-CoV-2, was the first documented E. coli-borne disease in human history, and the third E. coli to be identified as the etiological cause of SARS-CoV-2.
The first SARS discovery was in the Chinese province of Guangdong in late 2002, according to European records.
The SARS outbreak has spread across several countries and continents, causing 8,096 cases and 774 deaths.
Each case outside of the rapidly spreading ones is estimated to cause an increase in the number of cases of the advanced stage, which is 4 to 7 days of reproduction, with the peak viral load at the 10th day of infection.
Initial symptoms for patients with SARS-CoV include migraine, headache, fever, feeling craving, and cold, while the later symptoms include shortness of breath, diarrhea, and respiratory distress.
Lymphopenia (too few lymphocytes in the blood), impaired liver function tests, and elevated creatinine kinase (the enzyme that releases from damaged muscle) are common laboratory abnormalities caused by SARS.
Alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage proliferation have also been seen in SARS patients.
On average, 20-30% of patients require specialized treatment and respiratory support.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and kidneys can be affected in this difficult condition, which is often life threatening and is aggravated by cytotic storm, especially in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus first infected a relative of the patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong for a separate lung operation.
Since then, much energy has been poured into the research of Hkov.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It is reported to be most prevalent in children, adults and patients with respiratory disease who are immunocompromised.
Nasal discharge, eye irritation, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of HCV-NL63.
Another unique study in the Netherlands has identified the same virus in a nasal sample from an 8-month-old child suffering from bronchitis.
It is known only in the Netherlands, but is distributed worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for about 4.7% of all common respiratory infections, with peaks in winter, spring, and early September.
ECOV-NL63: It is associated with a condition known as throat obstruction.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old patient hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and throat disease, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with increased risk of severe asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide to cause mild respiratory illnesses.
All of these community-acquired HCVs were designed to work well in humans, and were generally less likely to cause highly pathogenic disease, although unknown causes posed risks, such as the highly contagious HCV-NL63 subtype, which was recently reported to cause lower respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs have the ability to become highly transmissible and persist in humans, they become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first identified in a 60-year-old patient with a pulmonary embolism that turned into pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases have come from the Middle East, a secondary outbreak of recent contacts has been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases reported.
The results of the investigation show that MERS is similar to SARS, with the progression of pneumonia becoming worse.
In contrast to SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, making MERS the most unusual of the previously reported cases of E. coli.
More than 30% of patients suffer from gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, with 34.4% of the cases being high-fatal, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses for infants.
A large number of pneumonia cases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, from mid- to late December 2019.
The World Health Organization says the emergence of lower respiratory tract infections due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has caught the attention of the global community and the disease has been named COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
In Hubei, China, the death rate of patients is 4.2% compared to 1.2% outside of the country.
SARS-CoV-2 causes a group of serious respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which manifest as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
diarrhoea has also been reported in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms of the disease, and can quickly lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their 82% high nucleotide sequence similarity, they are classified under different branches on the hereditary lineage tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic but highly contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases have been reported, likely contributing to the rapid spread of the disease worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals significant similarities and differences in their desirability.
First, the incubation and duration of HCV infection are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the traits of the other six HCoVs.
The severity of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs found in humans (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are more common during community-acquired HCV infection, including unresponsive, mild, or no symptoms.
On the other hand, although the prevalence varies, the severity of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows surprising behavioural patterns in community-infected HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of AHC, as it is spread in the community.
On the other hand, it has not yet been proven that SARS-CoV-2 will decrease its transmissibility after a period in the environment, as will SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to other EHVs, can be detected in a saliva sample.
While SARS-CoV-2 may play an important role in oral oral transmission, as in the SARS-CoV case, it should be clarified at least in some cases by future studies.
There is considerable interest in whether SARS-CoV-2 is mutagenic, as in the Echcovitch case, which is distributed in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmission, pathogenesis, and continuing transmission after infection have a significant impact on the ultimate fate of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.
All four community-derived HCoVs, which cause mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
from another perspective, it may be true that humans are well adapted to these four ecologies.
In other words, both of the ancient global epidemics of Echinacea may have been superfluous.
E. coli, which causes severe disease in the gut, and people infected with severe E. coli infections have been eliminated.
To make this happen, ECVs create a pool of targeted exchanges that counteract the limiting factors sufficiently well-concealed in humans.
In this case, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is likely to be fully adaptive to humans if it lasts for a long time and infects many people.
If it is well identified, it is difficult to isolate or stop other disease control measures.
Over the years, four community-acquired covoviruses have been repeatedly reported in the community, resulting in the common cold in immunocompromised victims.
These viruses do not require a major host animal.
In contrast, the most virulent strains of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are less commonly associated with mosquitoes, and their transmission from mosquito to mosquito cannot be stopped.
The possibility of persistence and reproduction in their pathogenic carriers, and the spread of suspected human cases, especially through one or another intermediate and reproductive carrier, needs to be explored.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-derived HCoVs.
Echovch is highly contagious, at least for the time being, as it has spread in society.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-transmitted HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it will fully adapt to humans and be transmitted to humans without a host or host animal remains to be seen.
Before we discuss which animals Echecovich comes from, it is useful to discuss the evolutionary, natural, connective and complementary definitions and characteristics of Echecovich's hosts.
If the tips share a high nucleotide sequence close to the original, the animal serves as an evolutionary carrier for the HCoV.
A hereditary virus is highly contagious and not highly transmissible to humans.
In a similar way, a substrate carrier holds the ECHO continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and carriers of the HCoVs or its parent virus.
Conversely, if the ECV is introduced into the host and host organisms in a new form before or during the introduction to the host, it will not integrate well with the new host and will often cause disease.
This carrier can serve as a zoonotic source for infection of humans and can play a role in accelerating the spread of the virus, transmitting the virus from humans to humans to increase the infection rate.
Unless we limit the spread of this temporary carrier, HCV could continue to be a disease that destroys the world's population.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to their medium-sized hosts and cause long-term epidemics.
This is when the middle carrier becomes a natural storage carrier.
Epidemiological data showed a history of contact with animals associated with the SARS main case.
The study found that the animal population was more similar to the anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
A mouse (Pugma larva) and a raccoon dog were first found at a wildlife market with viruses that look very similar to Sars-CoV, which looks like Sars-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS cases were reported after all the mosquitoes in the market were removed.
However, it was reported that cats did not carry Sars-CoV before they were exposed to the animal market, which is why cats are medium carriers, not natural carriers of Sars-CoV.
Specifically, since 80% of the animal species in the Gonzo market have anti-Sars-CoV antibiotics, it is impossible to separate the transmission and exacerbation of SARS-CoV by different mammalian species.
These are non-SARS-CoV carriers.
Species evidence shows that bats and mice serve as the genetic source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
These bats have been shown to possess anti-Sars-CoV antibodies and the Sarsr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other nightbird coves share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence imitation with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new theory of human pathogens in bats.
Several SARS-like covers (SL-covers) have been found in bats, but with the exception of one subclass WIV1, no virus has been isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 entry was interpreted as a receptor for bats, a fecal sample from bats and human ACE2 use.
Surprisingly, SARS patients do not have the ability to inject WIV1.
WIV1 represents the closest relative of SARS-CoV found in bats, with a 95% homology of the nucleotide formula.
Although there is a significant homology difference between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not direct carriers of SARS-CoV.
The study of the virus strain brings MERS-CoV together in the same group of bat cov-HKU4 and bat cov-HKU5.
Bat cov-HQ4 and MERS-CoV use the same transcriptional receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The Mers-Cove sequence of RNA polymerization based on RNA is inherited in reverse to the beta-CoVs; it occurs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living mars-cove has been found in the wild night owl.
MERS-CoV and its close relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the bat may not be a direct carrier of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that unlike the Arabian camels, the camels have a different antibody, MERS-CoV, which means that they are as susceptible to the virus as camels in many African countries, if not the Middle East.
The live MERS-CoV, which is similar to the virus found in the human body, differs from the nasal fluids of the Arabian camels, but the most striking feature is that camels are the exact carriers and transmitters of MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that in laboratory studies, camels vaccinated with MERS-CoV for testing were found to have generally mild symptoms but high viral load.
It should be noted that infected camels transmit the virus not only through respiratory tract but also through the faeces, which is the main route of transmission from bats.
However, the source of MERS has been questioned until now, as the disease was not detected in camels before the outbreak, and it is assumed that the MERS-CoV was caused by a mutated or unknown animal species.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide sequence with the ratite-CoV RTG13 isolated from Rhynolophysis affinis.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence relationships of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so complex that their relationship is difficult to predict.
This means that the bats may not be close carriers of SARS-CoV-2 unless similar covch bats are found in the future.
The animals that carry and transmit SARS-CoV-2 must have been sold and killed in the Hunan seafood supermarket, and several of the COVID-19 cases linked to this, suggesting that the animal-to-human transmission may have been avoided.
Recent studies on metagenomic analysis have shown that a small number of endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may be carriers of ancient beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% of the nucleotide formula with that of SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to the RTG13 at the level of their nucleotide sequence with a 90% affinity.
In the pathogenic category, SARS-CoV-2-like viruses are grouped under two subtypes, one of which shares a very similar 97.4% amino acid sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-2 infectious peak receptor (RBD).
Although the genome of the first-membrane sequence is extensive, it is clear that, contrary to the commonly accepted view, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are unique.
A previous study on infected pangolins found viral infections in lung samples, which were similar to those of SARS-CoV-2.
This study used various assembly methods and manual preparation to produce a genome precursor that comprised 86.3% of the entire length of the viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are the animal vectors of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-associated beta-CoVs, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly from pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathway in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains stable.
However, high homology sequence was found in RBDs, and beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 mechanism share high genome-wide sequence imaging.
High-level similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2 bound RBDs (receptor endpoints) and beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by a distinctly selective-deeply bound evolution.
The counter-proposal addressed the re-synthesis between pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wildlife actor.
The compound is widely distributed among beta-covalents as a catalyst for transformation.
The decision is still on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides HCoV, the most pathogenic, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that the two HCoVs HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from Lelthwaff Kovch, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 family viruses were found in the mouse strain.
ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge cov) from the North American tricolor nightingale has shown close similarity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has been identified as a relative of another bat covid found in Ghana and genetically named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, while camels have been identified as the intermediate carrier.
to be clear, our understanding of the animal origin of the echcovites is clearly illustrated in figure 1 and table 2.
Paleogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the transmission of EHCOs to intermediate species throughout history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 transmitted the agent from domestic animals to humans, a respiratory epidemic was recorded.
The distribution of HCoV-229E among species is not well understood.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
among them is alpaca alpha-cov.
Several sources support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, alpacas (the long-necked, hairy wild animals of South America) may have had contact with nightbirds in a shared ecological space, not humans.
Instead, humans have had little to no contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are isolated and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV has caused outbreaks of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-alpha-CoV has not been found in wildlife.
Therefore, we should not stop to speculate that alpacas may have acquired the alpha-CoV associated with HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that can be deadly to humans, including mad dog disease virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229 directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoVs can carry viruses and transmit them to humans, as can MERS-CoV, alpacas and Arab camels, while serving as the HCoV-229E gene pool.
Mers-Cov is a good example of a mosquito-borne disease, since it is transmitted from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The origin of mars-cove evolution was first identified in the nocturnal, and was reinforced by a series of discoveries.
It is clear that bats produce multiple sets of viral agents for gene exchange and gene transfer in the genome division.
Long-term exposure, crowding, close contact, and the ability of bats to fly with force are all favorable conditions for the spread of the virus.
merce-cove, on the other hand, had been keeping camels for decades.
It is well suited for these camels that have been converted from medium bearing to permanent and natural bearing.
MERS-CoV causes a moderate illness and maintains a low mutation in these animals.
The occasional human infection is accidental and unless the transmission pattern can be contained, humans will remain the carrier of this MERS-CoV pathogen.
The share of camels in the MERS-CoV transmission is unique compared to the share of pangolins in the Sars-CoV-2 transmission.
Pangolin beta-covas are especially high in health risk among pangolins.
Beta-CoVs may be the last carriers to come into contact with SARS-CoV-2, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2 in the case of the tick.
Several possibilities for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans via interaction should be explored in future studies and then monitored by an external study.
Early bats may be carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.
The larvae may share the same ecological zone with the moth, feeding on animals or mining coal.
Second, pangolin is transmitted by rapidly spreading carriers and by newly infected viruses associated with Sars-CoV-2.
People contract the virus when they kill and eat wild animals.
Many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Animal and wildlife testing for antibodies is permitted.
Third: As described above, the process of reassimilation and adaptation of Sars-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that was in contact with bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Unlike the various animal carriers, the three main causes of viral transmission are important for facilitating covid across species boundaries.
First, the highest comparability for the outliers is measured in the RNA ratio.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated covid replacement rate can be classified as moderate to high, with an average of ~10-4 replacements per year at 2 per place, based on the adaptation stage of covid for novel carriers.
Kvosch has a confirmation-reading exorbitance, the loss of which results in a very high degree of behavioral change and the inability to persist or continue.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogues of remdesivir are known to suppress COV replication, which is achieved by retaining this exoribonucleic acid and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being studied in clinical trials.
But the reproductive capacity of the kows is a million times greater than that of their host.
In addition, when cows are not well adapted to their host, their rate of spontaneous mutation is usually high.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It may have already been introduced to another host, if it is closer to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also affects MERS-CoV, which is inherited in monotremes.
In humans, genetic drift vaccines and antivirals are not as effective against SARS-CoV-2 as they are for rapidly spreading SARS.
Second, the extensive RNA genome in coVs provides additional plasticity in the modification of genomes through mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the chance of co-evolution for the genes and facilitating the occurrence of novel coronaviruses when conditions are favorable.
This is supported by several distinct transcriptional frameworks and protein functions that have been introduced into the 3′ end of the genome.
"Third, when the kovch RNA is replicated, it can replicate and mutate spontaneously and repeatedly by a special ""replicate-selection"" mechanism".
Inside the carrier, which serves as a solvent, the exchange of silk occurs frequently during the transcription of cov RNA.
Rare full length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine to form new coves.
Natural recombination phylogenetic residues were found in the bat-CoV SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9, which are also animal co-ovars, HKU-HKU1 and HKU-OC43.
The virus carrier is contagious in some cases.
In addition to the three viral factors listed above, contact with the virus is another critical and influential factor in the spread of the virus from the host species.
The SARS-CoV reassortment is taken as an example, which shows evidence of adaptive selection during intragenic events.
Based on comparative analysis, the hybrid between humans and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV, was found to be able to rapidly adapt to a variety of carriers, especially in the exchange of S protein RBD.
RBD, which is found in the general cov S protein, binds to the cellular receptor and is a widely selected antibody receptor.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the S1 region of the 318th to 510th amino acids, which bind to the ACE2 receptor for viral entry.
Sars-CoV RBD (Receptor Bore-Ended Infection) has the potential to detect ACE2 receptors in certain animals, including bats, bats, mice, and raccoon dogs, allowing the transmission of the virus by means of genomic sequencing.
In addition, 6 amino acid residues have been identified from different isolates of human and mouse viruses and 4 of those are exchanged for ACE2 receptors in the receptor-binding motif.
Cvet Sars-Cov RBD (the receptor of the peak of the pathogen) has K479 and S487T exchanges and increased the binding of the pathogen protein in the human ACC2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substituents may be critical to the virus's ability to adapt to humans.
SARS-CoV-2 is most interesting because it is transmitted by the same cells as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to the S protein binding to the S protein of the S1 unit, which can be tightly bound to the ACE2 gene.
Indeed, the Cryo-EM study suggests that this binding is 10 to 20 times more highly covalent than that between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein in humans.
It is necessary to determine whether or not any other major host is required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HC-NL63 binds to ACE2 but with another S-body.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
After being passed from the animal to the human, they have played a significant role in the successful adaptation of this virus to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, the distribution of the HCoVs in the genus is influenced by other carrier receptors and other factors.
The separation of these carrier proteins between humans and their natural hosts such as night birds, one-horned camels and long-faced mice may limit the transmission of genes.
For echovchs to have a successful cross-species spread, they must replace host-asylum cases and overcome host-inhibition.
In this regard, the molecular determinants around the critical viral carrier relationship are still being identified and characterized.
Using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology to screen for the non-destructive genome-wide dependence and limiting causes of SARS-CoV-2 carriers could be useful.
The rise of Novel Echtkovich: a return to the roots
The diversity of night owls creates a high probability of occurrence of new covars.
In this case, the nightingale's coven serves as the collection point for the echidna.
In addition, rapid translocation and genetic recombination are the two steps that determine the ECV process.
For example, the expression of novel protein cells has the potential to change the viral state.
Among SARS-CoV utility proteins, ORF8 has been found to be essential in the case of adaptation to humans, which has been isolated from SARS-CoV-related bats, although different ORF8 proteins have been found to be involved.
The loss of the SARS-CoV-29-nucleotide signature was discovered in efforts to isolate it during the early stages of the human pandemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b creating a homologous reproduction.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a historical connection with SARS-CoV and Gamma-CoVs, as the micro-transforms are found in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Resorption sites were also detected in the nsp9, most nsp10, and nsp14 regions.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV outbreak in Saudi Arabia among the monkeys was a manifestation of a cross-species recombination phenomenon.
In parallel with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other echovites, where the echovite's shapeless gene is recombined with another animal's covh.
It is necessary to be extremely cautious as the viral strain may produce unexpected mutations in the selected strains that may result from the isolation of the virus, especially in strains with a strong host immune system.
An example of this is the reduction in the total length of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, which means that two nucleotides are missing.
ORAF4 has been identified in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, which has shown a single nucleotide entry of alpaca alpha-CoV due to a membrane mutation.
Finally, the evolution of the Novel HCV is also driven by selective pressure in storage carriers.
When night owls are attacked by a crow, they show little or no sign of attack, indicating the harmony between the crow and the night owl.
The bats have been shown to be biologically and physically adapted to covid.
For example, night-flying mites reduce the risk of mosquitoes because they do not show symptoms of disease in advance.
On the other hand, the major histocompatibility sign of complex phase I molecules is low, as the upper binding of the NKG2/CD94 receptor in the natural killer cell is blocked by the natural killer cell activity in the night bird.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the nocturnal metabolic activity of the fly can put pressure on the cochlea or impair reabsorption by the exoribonucleus, so that the injection pressure for the virus generation can become highly pathogenic when it enters the host of the fly.
Additional pathogenic cluster strains can also be grown by fusion, leading to the development of new proteins or protein-sampling materials to adapt to the carrier.
So, it is no coincidence that the three Novel Hicks have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not as virulent as their primary vectors, such as bats and camels, or cause mild symptoms.
They will breed without a strong immune response to a vector.
The mystery of why asymptomatic carriers appeared and why they cause severe cases of infection in humans continues to unravel.
The severe symptoms occur mainly when the immune response is highly active and the cytokine levels are high in the area of the strong immune response, and the more severe these are, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, the immune response in the carriers was lower than that of covid-19.
The same mechanism of release of resistance response may have beneficial effects for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in night birds.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon should be useful at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the intestine.
In addition, the NLRP3 inflammasome is initially absent in bats.
In this way, the NLP3 enfilemasome from MCC950 can be used to treat COVID-19.
The origins of SARS-CoV-2 are followed by the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in general.
The beta-CoVs moth has been found to share 95% of the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV, while SARS-CoV-2 has a 96% nucleotide sequence with the beta-CoVs moth.
However, the mice and other animals in the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, and no known direct carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs were found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may be the closest of the carriers or that pangolin beta-CoVs may have absorbed the genetic profits of the last SARS-CoV-2 strain.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was either deliberate or accidental.
The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has brought attention back to covid.
The study of covovirus in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the pathogenic origins of covovirus and the importance of animal vectors in transmission to humans.
There is strong evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
The SARS-CoV infection was caused by contact between humans and mosquitoes in the marketplace, and the SARS-CoV outbreak would have been stopped if the markets had been closed and mosquitoes killed.
Similarly, given the presence of several strains of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent the transmission of the zoonotic (parasitic agent to humans).
However, whether or how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other animals will be determined in future studies.
merce-kov, on the other hand, was in a single-legged camel for a long time.
These camels are used for transportation, meat, milk, wool and leather products for the local community.
they are widely distributed from the middle east to africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China, as was done in the wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrence of MERS outbreaks, it is necessary to follow a holistic approach that, along with other infection control measures, will help to develop effective vaccines to prevent MERS-CoV, which infects camels.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new pathogens can emerge.
A variety of zoonotic coves are moving through the wild.
In particular, the disease-causing night-bird cows are very different.
These zoonotic cows have the potential to evolve and regroup to form new cows that are highly contagious and/or deadly to humans in the future.
wildlife slaughter for food should be banned in some areas of China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Given the risk of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, it is imperative to maintain high preparedness and full coverage for early treatment.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They will remain in their natural environment until conditions are favorable for their spread.
Although bats have a high potential to transmit viruses, contact with bats and other wildlife is reduced if people stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of cows and their natural hosts, which will confirm the importance of animal-to-human transmission and the prevention of future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent the origin of a pathogen is to avoid the ecological origin of the natural carrier of the pathogen.
Many details are lagging behind the SARS-CoV-2 origin hypothesis.
If a bat transmits Sars-CoV-2 to pangolins, it is necessary to study the similarities between the bat and pangolin.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of viruses to humans, it should be understood how humans can come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is a viable vector, it should be clarified how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and both infection surveillance and research should be conducted.
whether it is a bats, pangolins or other animals, it is expected to be a natural carrier of SARS-CoV-2 or its related viruses and the like.
Ongoing research in this area will explore the evolutionary course of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with suggestions for preventing and controlling COVID-19 in humans.
It is important to update the criteria for the diagnosis of suspected and unconfirmed COVID-19 cases.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid recommendation guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide presents our experience and provides a good reference for the fight against this pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our knowledge and awareness are gradually increasing through continuous research findings and clinical practice, and therefore, the methods of diagnosis and treatment continue to be up to date.
In this letter, we responded to our comments on the guidelines and provided the new diagnostic criteria in accordance with the latest diagnostic and medical guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the Committee of Public Health of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was renamed severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has prepared a quick advisory that was published online by the Army Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
it has attracted considerable attention since its publication.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, however, our understanding and knowledge is gradually increasing based on current research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, the methods of diagnosis and treatment are also continuously improved.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published a total of seven editions between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, with some contexts changed significantly.
Now that our guidelines have received input from these people, they have proposed a simplified score based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidance and adds value to this worldwide epidemic.
we support this vital work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs updating, according to the latest COVID-19 (trial version seven) and the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines from the studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (March 3, 2020), the suspected case must meet three clinical epidemiological history profiles to confirm that a comprehensive examination is required, or unless otherwise specified, two clinical profiles to include two items:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history to Wuhan city and its surroundings where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms, or history of travel or residence with other reported cases of COVID-19, (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with alumic acid testing), (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surroundings, or other communities associated with COVID-19 prior to onset of symptoms, (4) list of confirmed cases (≥ 2 KZ) occurring in 2 weeks in small areas of the cluster of confirmed cases (i.e. home, office, school/etc.)
Clinical profiles: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with key diagnostic features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte counts during the primary phase.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on the following suspected case: 1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; 2) overall genome sequence of the virus showing high susceptibility to the known novel coronavirus; 3) positive in serum test for a specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2; or a change in the recovery rate from a negative to a positive for a SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody, or more than 4 times the recovery rate over a sustained period.
Real-time PCR testing for respiratory or blood samples to detect nucleic acid was added to the second (January 18th, 2020) and third (January 22nd, 2020) editions.
The blood test was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions. Then serologic evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These adjustments, based on the researchers' ongoing work, are a good nucleic acid detection tool to aid rapid detection, as well as a blood sample to be added to a variety of samples from respiratory organs and to bring specific antibody positive results into the approved range.
In addition, there is more and more data from patients with and without natural symptoms that should alert us.
Therefore, since people without clinical signs were deemed to be a minor threat, the Zhou et al. process table should be updated.
The outcome system must also be validated in clinical trials and studies.
In conclusion, we invite readers to express their opinions.
We recommend that people follow and obey the new guidelines of their countries of origin, to investigate suspected cases and unconfirmed allegations.
our guidance team regularly updates our help page.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths for the day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the same day.
This is the highest death toll in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) had recorded and reported 114 cases of the disease, including 33 active cases and 33 recovered cases.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news summary, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirijaddi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Merzadi, two patients were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He said two of the pilots were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared that CID-19 was a pandemic.
The deaths included Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Benghazi Anti-Corruption Commission, who was under observation at Kuwait Maitree Hospital, the hospital authority told local news agency Anadolu.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would remain closed until next Saturday, longer than originally planned.
This public transportation shutdown initially began on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods - medical, fuel and food - was still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was on 8 March, when two people returned from Italy and one of them was a wife.
As of March 19, the three had already recovered.
The number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has exceeded one million.
The total number of cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus worldwide on Thursday exceeded one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 deaths have been linked to coronavirus infections.
Malawi has confirmed its first coronavirus cases, and Zimbabwe has recorded its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea has declared itself one of the few countries that remain free of coronavirus infection as of Thursday.
The World Health Organization announced yesterday that a total of 1,051,635 confirmed cases were reported, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours after 10 a.m. Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4 this year.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported that more than 1,000 people died in the United States on Wednesday from coronavirus infections, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced that they are taking strict measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's curfew until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will continue to receive their pay until April 30th.
The Portuguese parliament voted by 215 votes in favour, 10 against and 1 abstention to extend the national emergency for 15 days.
Saudi Arabia extends curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to a full day, after previously restricting them to between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfew at 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have lowered the limit of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian supermarket chains Wellworth and Coles lowered their sales limits for toilet paper per unit to two and one pack per unit in all stores nationwide.
ALDI also introduced the one-pack restriction on Monday.
These restrictions were posted on the exchanges and on the links to the Facebook pages.
Consumers have reportedly stored goods due to fears of COVID-19 and possible quarantine.
On Tuesday, Woolworths ordered a bundle of toilet paper/soft supplies to be taken home.
These changes follow the previous four-pack exchange limit introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in a press release on March 8 that "many stores are still selling in an hour's time" as the four-point curfew is being implemented and that demand "has never been seen before".
last week, sales showed a "significant increase", according to a woolworths spokesperson.
Costco store in Canberra reduced the permitted size to two packs last week.
To better reduce the shortage, Coles has ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency; Walworths has ordered more ready-to-sell items, and ALDI has scheduled special pre-order sales for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Retailers Association, said retailers want to increase sales, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times make it difficult.
He expects the price of production to fall as suppliers and others wait to develop specialized filets.
ALDI announced on Monday that some warehouses would not hold a special day on Wednesday, following the early release of the stock.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, said that the stores were filled with ready-made items for sale each night.
Toilet paper/soap is a bulky item, which means that it is available in fewer stores and, when sold, it creates a large open shelf space, which creates the feeling of a shortage.
"The idea behind cole and wolworths is that if you have a lot of items on the shelves, you can reduce the noise that can be caused by the abundance of sanitiser and towels", said russell zmerman, according to abc.
The leading post-cycle toilet paper manufacturer said last Wednesday that it was running out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, Knex Toilet Soft, and Solaris Paper, which operates a garbage collection, indicated that they are working 24/7 to support the delivery, as reported by News.com.au.
The real estate website Domain.com reported that some property sellers in Melbourne are giving away free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction, as some auctions are not held during the long weekend due to the holiday of the buyer.
The NT News Thursday edition, published daily in Darwin, included an eight-page insert that could be folded and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases, as reported by ABC Australia on March 3.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products, including masks, sanitizers, dryware, hand sanitizers and powder, are also in high demand.
Similarly, outside of australia, british online okado supermarket announced on sunday that andreas's edible section would sell only 12 cases.
the world health organization has declared covid-19 a global pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) now declared the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
The term pandemic is not only about the severity of a particular case, but also about the spread of the disease, and it indicates the rapid response of the governments of the A.I.D.
"All countries can still reverse the course of the pandemic".
"if countries examine, collect, protect, search and respond to the people", said the director general of the world health organization, tedros adhanom gebreyesus.
we are focusing on taking appropriate action given the severity and concern of the disease.
"According to the former US Director of Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Tom Frieden, the pandemic has been described as ""unprecedented"".
"In comments published on CNN in February, he said, ""there have been no respiratory viruses other than influenza since the outbreak until the next global outbreak"."
"Jesus said, ""We have not seen a pandemic like the coronavirus".""
"He continued, ""and we have never seen a previous pandemic that could be controlled at the same time""".
The new situation follows the decision by the World Health Organization to declare the spread of the global threat of the outbreak a public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fucus, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the spread of the disease is becoming more severe as it has penetrated the community.
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths as a result.
The 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak is the ongoing 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus outbreak, which is caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was declared a global public health emergency in Wuhan, China, on 30 January 2019, and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries, and it has caused approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered from the disease.
This case fatality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, and in the rest of the world it is estimated to be 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Fever, cough, and shortness of breath are the main symptoms.
complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but this can range from two to fourteen days.
there is no known vaccine or antiviral treatment for this.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended prevention measures include hand washing, covering the nose when urinating, maintaining social distancing, and self-monitoring and self-isolation for those who suspect they have been infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, time limits, workplace risk controls, and closure of facilities.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic stress, the postponement and cancellation of sporting events, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages in the wake of the shock.
Schools and universities in 193 countries, locally or globally, have closed, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the student population.
The spread of false information about the virus online is causing discrimination and discrimination against Chinese, South and East Asians and other countries where the virus has been detected.
Due to reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions were reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Yubei Province) reported a case of pneumonia of unknown origin on December 31, 2019, and initiated an investigation in January 2020.
Most of the cases are linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, and the virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the nocturnal avian coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first case of infection was diagnosed on 1 December 2019, and the individual has no apparent connection to the category of the wet market.
At the beginning of December 2019, two-thirds of the cases were not connected to the market.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post reported that the first case was detected in a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province, China, on 17 November 2019.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that the number of cases in China had decreased, and that cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea had increased.
There may be many minor reported cases, especially in animals with mild disease observation.
As of 26 April, fewer cases have been reported in adolescents under 19 years of age than at any other time, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be vaccinated before effective disease control could be achieved.
Cases refer to people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test result has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, had official guidelines that only those with mild symptoms should be tested.
According to a study published on 16 March, about 86% of COVID-19 cases in China were unknown as of 23 January. These undocumented cases accounted for 79% of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of cases in Italy would be higher than the number of cases reported.
The original estimate for the baseline recombination rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that 5.7 is likely.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who don't know, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths related to COVID-19 have been recorded.
As of February 5, 80% of the deaths reported in China were over 60 years old, and 75% had pre-existing circulatory and diabetic conditions.The official death rate due to COVID-19 is generally based on official protocols for COVID-19 positive deaths.
The death toll from COVID-19 may be higher if deaths that were not diagnosed, such as deaths at home, in the home, etc., are not included.
Partial data from Italy suggest that the number of deaths during the pandemic was four to five times higher than the official COVID death toll.
"We recognize that [the reported death toll] is an underestimate", said a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adding that such reports of underreporting in the U.S. are rare during the pandemic, such as in the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 swine flu.
The first death from mainland China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
As of January 28, the most deaths outside of China were reported in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories declared deaths on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region, but over time they tend to be overwhelmed by factors such as the number of diagnoses, the quality of healthcare, the physician and the management, the time since the outbreak, and the population's health status, such as age, gender, and general health. The death-to-case ratio is the ratio of the number of deaths to the number of people who died within a specified time frame.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global case-fatality rate as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies from region to region.
In China, the case-free mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (for those diagnosed from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those diagnosed after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the case-free mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people who have died from the disease who have been tested, and the infection-free mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of people who have died from the disease (both tested and untested).
These statistics are not time-bounded, and follow a specific case sequence if a population is infected.
several scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Health Centre, based on the evidence, estimated that the mortality rate due to the outbreak could be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The initial estimate for this range is based on the COVID-19 test in Germany and the CFR estimate in a statistical study.
WHO notes that the epidemic is manageable.
It is difficult to say with certainty when the epidemic will reach its peak and how long it will last, and it may vary from place to place.
Marcy Penn of Penn State University says the epidemic will remain the same, and the number of people infected will decrease.
But it is not possible to predict when this will happen.
Zhong Nan Shan, the Chinese government's top medical adviser, praised the WHO's recommendation that if all countries move to follow the measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, "it could stop by June".
"On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 ""may recur for a year or two"".
"According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures are "required" until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
"This coronavirus is so easily transmissible that it is difficult to say it will disappear completely, and I think it may come back every year and turn into a seasonal disease", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University.
The return damage is determined by a combination of immunity and DNA mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory fluid buildup (acne), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremors, vomiting, a cough with blood in it, diarrhoea or skin rash. The World Health Organization says that about one in six people may develop the condition and have difficulty breathing and breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists what are called emergency symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden fussing, difficulty walking, and swelling of the face or lips, which should be treated immediately. Further spread of the disease can result in widespread pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, dyspnoea, infection, and death.
The researchers suggested that if some of those infected may have no symptoms, no clinical symptoms but a positive test result, those who have had contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened to ensure that the infection is eliminated.
The Chinese estimated the absence of signals to be as low as 44%.
The typical incubation period (the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms) is in the range of one to 14 days, usually five days.An example of uncertainty is the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell, initially at 30%, and later decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the virus spreads are yet to be revealed.
The disease is transmitted mainly by close contact and small droplets formed during urination, sneezing, or talking, with the closest contact being 1-2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that uncovered saliva can produce waves of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some speculate that the virus may be transmitted through droplets that may form during speech and that these droplets may remain in the air for long periods of time. Respiratory droplets may also form during respiratory processes, including vomiting, but the virus is not airborne in general.
they may rest on the mouths or nostrils of people nearby or be attracted to the lungs.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can expose respiratory tract surgeons to the risk of respiratory illnesses.
a person can spread the virus by touching contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is a risk of transmission through contact, this risk is very unlikely to occur.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted orally. The virus is considered highly transmissible in the first three days of its detection, although it is not asymptomatic and can be transmitted through contact with infected individuals.
People were diagnosed with the disease three days before they began to show symptoms, indicating that the disease can be transmitted before symptoms appear.
There were very few laboratory-confirmed cases of transmission, but similar cases were detected when the virus was tested in other countries without a vaccine.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said it was not entirely clear how easily the disease spread, with one person transmitting the disease to two to three others.
The virus can survive for up to three days on plastic (especially polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have also tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British officials recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, just as they would after an infected person touched a surface.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that was first isolated from three people in Wuhan with pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory illness.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature with a related coronavirus. Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, as soap removes the virus's protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed that the zoonotic origin is.
Genetic analysis shows that the coronavirus is genetically classified with two strains from the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Serbcovirus (lineage B) and other Lilt Waff strains.
At all genomic levels, it is 96% identical to another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequence between pangolins and human viruses.
The whole-genome comparison to date has found that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share about 92% of the genetic material, which is sufficient to confirm that pangolins are intermediate carriers.
Viral infection can be treated based on symptoms, but confirmation is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT scans.
A study in Wuhan that compared PCR to CT found that CT was more sensitive than PCR, but with a slightly lower clarity and many visual features similar to those of other lung tumours and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used as a screening test or as a first-line test for COVID-19.
The WHO published the first edition of the guidelines for the process of isolated RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 on 17 January.
The test uses the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on a sample of respiratory tissue or blood.
Results are generally available from a few hours to a day.
The test is generally done by rubbing the inside of the nose, and a throat swab may be taken. Many laboratories and organizations are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been validated enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US, the serological test developed by Selx is only approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) and the behavior of people with markings are fluidized between the non-uniform shaped and the non-uniform shaped glass and the fluid between the absent and the sampa.
The Italian Radiological Society is developing an international online image database of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections, such as adenovirus, the scope for detecting COVID-19 is limited to images not confirmed by PCR.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and considered it a fast and more accurate screening tool for infections, although the image showed little variation.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect the visible content of the virus via radiographs and CT.
Methods to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and rubbing and sneezing on softs and throwing softs directly into the trash.
Those who are already vaccinated are advised to wear a surgical mask before going to a public place.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission of the disease.Many governments have banned or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries where the spread is most widespread.
However, the virus has reached a point of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some community members do not know where and how they became infected. Healthcare providers who care for a potentially exposed community are advised to take regular and standard precautions, such as touch precautions and eye protection. Testing for absence of physical contact with an infected person, tracing is a very useful method for health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent transmission.
The use of local data from government mobile phones for this purpose has raised individual concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have called for limits on such surveillance.
Many mobile apps have been proposed for use on the FLAGAT, and many experts expect that by May 7, 2020, they will have another option to use Bluetooth.
If users are in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, they will receive a message.Misconceptions are being spread about how to prevent infections, for example, that rinsing the nose and mouth with a mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 despite many organizations working to create it.
Hand washing is recommended to reduce the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are obviously dirty; before eating; and after touching, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because washing with soap and water kills the virus outside the body.
The CDC recommends the use of a 60% alcohol hand sanitizer where soap and water are unavailable.
WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be cleaned with a variety of solutions (stainless steel cleaner in one minute), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% propylene, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chromium hexadecide gluconate, are less effective.
As the CDC advises, COVID infection should be suspected or confirmed in service area, office or childcare setting, and should be disinfected with antiseptic in bathrooms, shared utility areas and shared electrical areas, desks, shared computers, ATMs, and other areas.
Health organizations have advised people to cover their mouth and nose with a folded arm or a scythe when they cough or sneeze, and to discard any scythe immediately.
Surgical treatment is recommended only for those who are infected, as it can prevent the virus from spreading and limit the spread of the virus when they cough, sneeze, and sneeze.
the world health organization has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leigh University, "Wearing a mask can reduce the chance of people touching [their] face, which in turn avoids the main source of infection that can occur with unwashed hands". "Masks can also prevent people who may be infected from spreading the infection to another person".
Health people should not wear face and mouth masks unless they are in contact with people who are providing care for people with COVID-19, and even if they understand that wearing face and nose masks is a good idea.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by members of their populace.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of cloth. China recommends the use of disposable medical masks in a healthy part of the community, especially when in close contact with others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Wearing a surgical mask is recommended when using public transportation or when staying in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to wear face masks and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam ordered all citizens to protect themselves and others by wearing face masks when going outdoors in public places.
The Austrian government requires that anyone entering a grocery store wear a face mask.
Israel requires all its citizens to wear face masks and face shields when they go out.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million face masks a day since mid-March, has ordered train passengers and city bus users to wear face masks from April 1.
Panama mandated that all people who go out wear face masks, while encouraging those who cannot afford to buy face masks to do their homework.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, North Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves preventing the spread of the disease and reducing contact between individuals to reduce the spread of the disease.
The measures include quarantines, travel bans, and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing measures by staying home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, avoiding contact, and physically isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are currently recommending and mandating social distancing in states affected by the pandemic.
The combined recommendation of the US government body and the World Health Organization was to reduce the number of gatherings from 250 (if there were no known symptoms of COVID-19) to 50 and then down to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned all outdoor social gatherings of more than two people.The CDC recommends that people who are elderly and medically-trained, such as those with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and those with weakened immune systems and who are at risk of severe illness and other complications, stay out of their homes as much as possible in the affected area.In late March, WHO and other health organizations began replacing the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"" because the goal is to reduce social contacts by keeping social networks offline or physically distant".
The term social distancing is used to refer to people who must engage in complete social isolation, rather than being advised to continue contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the global pandemic.
These include only having sex with someone who is living with you and who is free of the virus or symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people who are suspected to be infected and have COVID-19.
Health agencies have provided detailed self-quarantine guidelines. Many governments recommend self-quarantine for people in areas where the virus is most prevalent.
Strict self-isolation guidelines have been issued for those in high risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the virus has spread are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last day of exposure.
The strategies used to control the spread are to block or prevent and reduce.
The lockdown is in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate those infected and to promote other new ways of controlling infection so as to reduce the spread to the rest of society.
If the spread of the disease cannot be contained further, trials will then be moved to the containment phase, where measures will be taken to reduce the spread and address the impacts on the health care system and the community.
The combination of prevention and resistance measures can be taken together.
Reducing the baseline breeding rate to below 1 requires more drastic measures to reverse the global pandemic. One part of infectious disease control is to try to reduce the spread of the disease using a process known as the epidemic approach.
This will allow more time to prepare vaccines and treatments, avoiding overcrowding of health services.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that could contain the outbreak include hand hygiene, masking and self-isolation; social measures to enforce physical distancing, such as closing schools, cancelling public gatherings; community involvement to ensure such measures are adopted; and adequate sanitation.
other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and quarantine, and issued notices when infected people were in the field.
Singapore itself has been a strong supporter of the temporary suspension, but has re-imposed sanctions on those who have done so.
Taiwan has increased production of face masks and coordinated distribution of medical supplies.The survey of the United Kingdom and the United States shows that reduction (reducing the spread of the epidemic but not stopping it) and control (reversing the progression of the epidemic) are serious challenges.
the use of preferential policies reduces primary health problems by two thirds and reduces deaths by half. but thousands of deaths and lack of health care systems indicate that there is a lot of problems.
While suppression may be preferable as long as the virus is circulating in humans, it should wait until (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first) when conditions are right for the virus to return to circulation.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic will lead to social and economic collapse.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including testing existing drugs.
taking over the counter medication, drinking fluids, and resting may help to reduce symptoms.
depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, blood vessels and respiratory support may be required.
steroids can lead to worse outcomes.
A number of sites authorized for treatment of viral diseases are being evaluated for services for treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" may provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity for COVID-19 patients' needs and facilitating health care is a fundamental step to prevent the spread of the disease, WHO said.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidance to hospitals and primary health care services to mobilize resources in a number of ways, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancelling procedures whenever possible, identifying and isolating COVID-19 positive patients and training staff to increase intensive care capacity and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are many theories about where the first event (Patient Zero) originated.
The first case of coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually decreased.
Most of these were linked to the Hawaiian seafood wholesale market, in addition to those selling live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these animal species, or in other words, a zoonotic origin.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted colleagues to the outbreak of a ""SARS-like coronavirus"". "
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were given a police warning for spreading false rumors, while another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her boss for spreading the rumors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued an official announcement on December 31 and informed WHO.
The number of cases of unknown pneumonia was reported to health officials in Wuhan for testing in early January. During the initial phase of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, migration and the arrival of the Chinese New Year as a transportation hub and major railway interchanges helped spread the virus to other provinces in China.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, official data from the WHO showed that 6,174 people had been diagnosed with the virus as of January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy in confirmed cases.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported globally, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
Nearly 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Many countries in the Schengen Area have imposed border controls to restrict free movement due to the outbreak in Europe.
National measures include lockdowns (not leaving home, preparing for a stay, or closing down) and restricting movement.As of April 2, approximately 300 million people, or 90%, in the United States were under lockdown, 50 million people in the Philippines were under lockdown, 59 million in South Africa were under lockdown, and 1.3 billion people in India were under lockdown.
On 26 march, 1.7 billion of the world's population were either under house arrest or in some other form of confinement, up from two billion to 2.6 billion, or about one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan on December 1, 2019, with an unconfirmed report indicating that the previous case was detected on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with a case of pneumonia of unknown origin on December 26, and then reported it to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) on December 27, at her hospital.
December 27, 2019 Genetic testing of patient samples shows the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A rumor ad was released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The World Health Organization was notified on the same day.
when these announcements were made, doctors in the water had received a warning from the police for spreading rumours.
China's National Health Commission said there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in the first place.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus, according to the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping.
In what has been described as the largest quarantine in human history, the curfew in Wuhan, or the ban on travel in and out of the city, was lifted on January 23 and extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting an estimated 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) has been canceled in many places.

In January and February 2020, 5 million Chinese lost their jobs during the height of the Wuhan pandemic.
Nearly 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were forced to stay at home or stay in the middle of the country in Hubei Province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak has caused the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate is estimated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis to be as high as 32%. The lockdown in India has left millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid daily wages) without work. An Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment. In Spain, almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs since the lockdown began in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit, while nearly half a million German companies sent their employees to the government's short-term redundancy scheme, Kurzarbeit.
The short-term work compensation program implemented in Germany has been implemented in France and England.
The arts and cultural sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals who are employed and self-employed internationally.
Art and cultural sector organizations have tried to uphold their missions (often assisted by the government) of presenting cultural heritage to the community, protecting the well-being of their staff and the public, and supporting the actors in every possible way.
As of March 2020, libraries, museums, theaters, and other cultural institutions around the world have been relocated or postponed, with performances being cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been major efforts to provide a digital alternative to the platform. Another recent and rapidly growing phenomenon of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced that the Holy Week in Rome, the last Christian penitential fasting, has been cancelled.
Many dioceses have advised elders to stay home and not attend church services on Sundays; some churches have made church services available on radio, online live or television, while others have offered to drive to worship.
Since the Roman Catholic Church banned worshippers from meeting together and St. Peter's Square was cleared of Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations have also restricted religious services and prohibited crowds from congregating in churches.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced that Friday prayers were canceled and shrines were later closed in the affected areas, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign spiritual travelers and the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has put a great strain on the world's sporting events and programs since World War II.
Many sporting events have been canceled, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The pandemic has delayed the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled for late July, until the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would "re-start after 2020 but not later than 2021".Casinos and gaming venues have been closed worldwide, and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
This has led to a surge in online gambling, and many online gambling sites have reported increases in the number of new registrants. The entertainment industry has also been affected, and many bands have cancelled their concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists have explored the possibility of creating and sharing traditional live streaming services such as live streaming concerts or web-based 'festivals' as an alternative to the Internet, allowing artists to perform, broadcast and record their work".
A number of coronavirus-themed online entertainment has been circulating, many of which have unexpectedly turned into comedy and satire.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, high levels of exclusion, prejudice and racism have been observed among Chinese and Asians, people of East Asian ethnicity, and people from Europe, the United States and other countries with high incidence.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have been reported in many countries, and in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most of the cases reported were in China so far) suggested that racial sentiments were being expressed by various groups around the world, such as those who felt that the Chinese people deserved the virus or that its arrival was an appropriate retaliation.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has been rising in some African cities.
He has repeatedly said that Wuhan and Hubei will be discriminated against simply because they are the source of the virus.
There is support for Chinese people both online and offline and in the affected areas.
In countries that have seen the first high-profile outbreaks of COVID-19 in Europe, such as Italy, which has become a new hot spot, the event may be followed by uncertainty and uncertainty.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been widely used on Twitter.
Increased incidences of racial violence and violence were reported among the Chinese population, as well as among other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus a Chinese virus and has been branded as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attack a bus carrying Ukrainians and other foreigners from Wuhan to Novy Sanzary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities have reportedly experienced a rash associated with the coronavirus outbreak.
"The state chapter president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that China has ruined nature and 'that's why God is taking revenge on them.'"
"The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later denounced his comments as "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents have been rampant due to the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" and "targeted for elimination".
Many newspapers that do not have paid-only sections have eliminated these sections due to some or all of the coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the outbreak available for access.
Some scientists have shared their results on servers such as bioRxiv to rapidly preprint.

Laboratory tests are used to detect the presence of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus and the antibodies that respond to this infection.
The virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which is able to detect the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is limited and is useful for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.
to help identify the most recent or active strains.
Identification of antibodies (serology) is helpful for both diagnosis and public surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have the disease, including how many people have symptoms but report little or no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the immunity of the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country has a definitive data on the extent of the population spread as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, with significant variation in the results from country to country.
This differentiation has the potential to have a significant impact on mortality rates, as it is higher than the actual estimates in some countries.
Using the instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on a sample of nasal fluid such as a swab or a swab.
Results are available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing, which is based on a sample of the throat fluid, is only reliable in the first week of infection.
The virus can then be destroyed from the throat and replicate in the lungs.
For those tested positive in the second week, an alternative sampling device from Deep Airways can be used with a suction catheter or a saline (salt) assay.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Berlin in January 2020 by Charité.The polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) developed at that time was reversed and 250,000 tests were distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020. Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, developed a clinical-grade PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
"It seeks the ""E"" gene found in all coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI team was one of the first organizations to receive an emergency emergency benefit from China's National Health Products Administration, and a PCR-based identification tool for SARS-CoV-2. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is simultaneously distributing the RT-PCR test panel to community health laboratories through the Global Agent Source".
In three genetic tests, incorrect results were found due to the presence of a valid reagent in the old test kits, and a test break occurred at the CDC in Atlanta, where an average of 100 samples were successfully tested daily throughout the month of February 2020.
As of 28 February 2020, it was not determined whether the tests using two components were reliable, and until then, national and local laboratories had not received approval to conduct the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use license. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that a national RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test was available.
Quest Diagnostics made the national COVID-19 test available on March 9th, 2020.
No dose limit is specified, and sampling and screening should be done according to the CDC standard.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and manufactured by VECTOR, the state-owned center for virology and biotechnology research.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Federal Health Examination.On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test for COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA to conduct a test that provides results in a maximum of 3.5 hours, allowing 4,128 tests to be performed in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories, which is testing the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Cepheid received the same EUA from the FDA on March 21, 2020, and it is 45 minutes long.
The FDA has recommended that isoterman nucleic acid amplification technology be licensed as a replacement for PCR.
Since this variable temperature does not require a cycle, a positive result is obtained in as little as five minutes, and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.
The United States currently has 18,000 machines, and Abbott is ramping up production to allow 50,000 tests per day.The test, which uses monoclonal antibodies, binds directly to the Novel Coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) and is expected to show results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to the rapid influenza test.
The Literature Review in March 2020 concluded that the cost of chest radiographs in the early stages is very low, but that CT results may be available even before the mark is seen on the site.
Typical features on the CT include dual multibar ground-glass opacitors with parallel, uncoupled and backward diffraction.
The pressure of subdiversity, incorrect stability and all-inclusiveness is increasing as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in water at baseline found that CT has a more sensitive characteristic than PCR, but with a lower limitation, most of its imaging characteristics are similar to those of pneumonia and the disease process.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used as a primary COVID-19 test, and in March 2020, the CDC recommended the use of PCR as a primary test.
The immune response is the production of antibodies to the immune system, including IgM and IgG.
These are used to detect infection, determine immunity, and in population studies in people who have been symptomatic for 7 days or more. Testing can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or at point of care (PoCT).
Automated systems called High-Shrupts can perform these tests in most clinical laboratories, and the amount of detection will be determined by the amount of product in each system.
A single blood sample is commonly used for CLT, but serial samples may be used to detect immune response.
A blood sample for PoCT is usually obtained by needling.
Unlike PCR methods, a pre-initiation step is not required.On March 26, 2020, the Agency notified 29 facilities that they could now distribute antibody tests as required.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for emergency use.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for the detection of IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test has the capacity to test hundreds of samples per hour, which is faster than PCR to isolate viral RNA from a normal sample.
Antibodies usually separate in 14 days of infection. At the beginning of April, no antibody detection kits were available in the UK.
Hong Kong has taken steps to allow suspected patients to stay at home, with the Emergency Department providing a sample tube for the patient to breathe in, return, and test for results later.The UK NHS is also developing a system to test suspected cases at home, which would prevent people from infecting others if they went to hospital, and an ambulance would be used to clean up infection.For a case of suspected driving to pass a COVID-19 test, a health professional would take a sample using the correct device.
The drop-in centers in South Korea have enabled the fastest, most extensive testing in the country.In Germany, the National Medical Association for Legal Health Insurance reported on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform 12,000 tests per day in ambulances, compared to 10,700 tests the previous week.
When you book a medical check-up, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
As of march 19, driving tests were still being conducted in many major cities.
The total number of tests in Germany on 26 March 2020 is unknown, as only positive results are reported.
"Initial laboratory studies show that at least 483,295 samples were tested as of 12/2020 from the calendar week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital tested a method to test samples from 64 patients at once, mixing samples and only testing positive.
With construction under the close supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the modeling work in Hubei could have been 47% higher, and the cost of quarantine would have been twice as high if the testing had not been initiated.
Following the Wuhan Laboratory, they have been opened in 12 cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As of 4 March 2020, daily mass tests were 50,000 per day. Open Source Multiplex Designs was released by Origami Assays, using only 93 tests to test 1122 COVID19 patient samples. These balanced designs can be done in small labs and do not require robotic fluid containers.
In March, testing shortages and shortages in the European Union, UK and the US led to a significant slowdown in the mass testing process.
This has led some authors to investigate certain testing procedures, such as heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA and allow further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was testing more per capita than any other country and was on track to reach the majority of the population.
"This is a driving test, and the whole population is tested by the laboratory from Team 42 and BGI (which is based in the "Huo-Yan" laboratory in China)".
The laboratory, built in 14 days, can handle thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, and is the first in the world outside of China to be able to operate at this scale.
Different test sequences targeted different genotypes of coronaviruses, and were produced in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German manufacturing recipe for low-income countries that cannot make their own.
The German order of dispatch was issued on January 17, 2020, but the protocol from the United States Centers for Disease Control was not ready until January 28, causing delays in testing in the United States and China, and the United States was facing problems with reliance on testing equipment at the start of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient testing equipment to meet the demand and provide recommendations from health experts.
On the contrary, experts say, South Korea's extensive testing capacity has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has been building up testing capabilities for several years, often in private sector laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended that testing be accelerated to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing equipment due to the rapid spread of the virus has led to a shortage of hundreds of thousands of viral tests and a chemical shortage.
In March 2020, China announced that it had problems with the accuracy of its detection equipment.
In the United States, the CDC's tests were problematic, and the government eliminated bureaucracies that restricted private testing. Spain purchased tests from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but the results were not accurate.
The organization explained that the erroneous results could be due to the incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of the equipment.
According to the Spanish Ministry of Health, the equipment that produced incorrect results will be returned and replaced with a separate test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic reported that 80% of the test kits they purchased from China produced incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that these be dumped in the Danube. According to Ateş Kara, a Turkish health ministry official, Turkey has not used the test kits it bought from China because they have a high error rate. Turkey has purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced that they could not be used at the beginning of April 2020.
Testing, including the isolation of people who tested positive and the monitoring of people with SARS-CoV-2, has led to a positive outcome.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vittorio Veneto, where the first COVID-19 death was recorded in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on a total population of 3,400 within ten days of each other.
Half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all known cases were in isolation.
It has been possible to stop new infections due to restrictions on travel to the community.
Due to the high demand for contact lenses, travel restrictions and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak spread at a much slower rate in Singapore than in other developed countries, but very severe measures were not taken, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home until March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 after a break.
Many other countries have managed to contain the epidemic through high levels of contact monitoring, restricted travel, testing, quarantine, but few have managed to do so through moderate national restrictions, such as those in Iceland and South Korea.
According to statistical studies, countries with more testing than deaths are less likely to be infected, perhaps because these countries can detect those with few or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited testing capacity and limited experience in COVID-19 testing send their first five positive COVID-19 samples and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 testing centers for stability testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in South America, and 1 in Australia.
The following chart shows the positive column as a percentage of people tested, and is influenced by the country's testing policy.
The percentage of people tested only in hospitals is higher than the percentage of the entire population tested positive, meaning that other factors remain unchanged, whether they have symptoms or not.
hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning the hands to remove dirt, grease, germs, or other unwanted substances.
Handwashing with soap at certain times of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted to the mouth by unwashed hands.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous tissue), they may also contract respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold.
The five critical occasions during the day when hand washing with soap is important include: before and after cleaning the toilet, after washing the baby's bottom or changing diapers, before and after feeding the baby and before eating food, and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If there is no soap, wash hands with ash water.
before, during, and after preparing food.
before and after caring for a sick person.
after changing diapers or using the toilet.
after you blow your nose, or brush your nose.
after eating an animal, eating animal food, or touching animal waste.
medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of infection.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean up pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or germs that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
this is especially important for those who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also a useful practice for the general public.
Hand washing has several health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the transmission of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and plans to reduce infant mortality in home birth.
A 2013 study found that improved hand-washing habits may lead to slight improvements in height for children under five years old.
In developing countries, the rate of infant deaths related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap and water.
this simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by as much as 50%.
Interventions that promote bathing can reduce diarrhea by as much as one-third, compared to providing clean water to low-income communities.
48% reduction in diarrhea incidence can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Washing with soap is the single most effective and simple way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) that have occurred in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths annually.
about 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet in a routine manner could save more lives than any single vaccination or medical intervention, reduce deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and reduce deaths from severe respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is often combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
hand washing also prevents the transmission of skin diseases through direct physical contact.
Minor damage to hand washing Repeated hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dryness.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition called hand itchiness, or hand-biting, which is especially common among health care workers.
too frequent hand washing is also one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd).
To reduce the spread of infection, there are five critical times during the day when soap and washing is necessary: after using the bathroom (urinating, defecating), after cleaning the bottom of the baby (changing hygiene), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Practice proper hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of infection, including before and after treating a cut or wound; after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose; after touching animal or animal waste; and after touching human waste.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is the norm.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households washed their hands at home. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent. Closely behind the average are the United States at 77 percent and China at 23 percent. There are several behavioral change strategies in place to promote handwashing in times of crisis.
In the Philippines, the "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education is cited as a model for action to improve children's health and education.
The main objective of this national program is to promote the slogan of hand washing with soap and detergent, disinfection with fluoride and disinfection of teeth twice a year.
Indonesia has also successfully implemented it.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding water to soaps or liquid detergents.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce dissolving barriers and increase solubility.
Since the organic soil's fats and proteins are not easily removed by water, water alone is an insufficient skin cleanser.
However, the cleaning is aided by a moderate water flow ..
dry soap can be recycled and may contain bacteria from previous use.
A few studies that have examined bacterial circulation with contaminated solid soap have concluded that it is less likely to cause problems because it removes germs from the foam.
The CDC still says that liquid soap is preferable for hand-free controls.
Antibacterial soaps have been widely used in the community to promote healthy habits.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antibiotics or antimicrobials selectively selects antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain a common antibacterial carrier, such as tricon, which contains a large amount of cell line.
Therefore, although antibiotic resistant strains may not be as effective as expected if they are not selected by antibacterial soaps.
In addition to skin protection agents, advanced forms may include: pH control, antibacterial benzoic acid and additional skin coolants (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal extracts), acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that clear soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps in preventing illness and removing bacteria from carriers.
The hot water that is convenient for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot and soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils that hold soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that hot water has no effect on reducing microbial load on our hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is another alternative to water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic and non-water-based hand hygiene alternatives (known as alcohol-free hand sanitizers, antiseptic hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (a polymer of oleic acid) to form a gel, or as a glycerin solution, or to be used in powder and alcohol drying to reduce the effect.
The addition of mixed hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germicides.
alcohol disinfectants kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), pneumonia and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol hand sanitizers remove 99.97% of bacteria from hands after 30 seconds of application (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibels) and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria from hands in 1 minute. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not fully effective in eliminating viral infections (or norweck), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptic or alcohol washing should be used to dry or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of each finger and the ends of each finger are painted for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The tips of the fingers should be washed thoroughly with both hands. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand sanitizer testing, especially when it is obvious that the hand is dirty.
The increase in the use of these agents is due to their ease of use and quick killing activity on microorganisms, but they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless anti-depressants and/or skin moisturizers are included in the formula.
The effects of alcohol desiccation can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers or antibacterial soaps have resulted in significantly less skin irritation and dryness.
Allergic contact skin disease, osteoporosis, or alcohol-induced hand allergy or allergen-induced hand infections are less likely to occur due to the contents of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
The incidence of skin infections is higher compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not wash hands of organic materials, but they do easily destroy them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogenic organisms, as pathogens can still be found on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends primarily on ingredients and flavor, with the qualification level being lowered alcohol and alcohol-containing ingredients.
more recently, benzaconic chloride formulations have been shown to be less effective after repeated doses, unlike alcohol, which is less effective after a single dose.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and instead use a mortar or a pestle.
The ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or soil is contaminated with microbes, it could increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
like soap, ashes are a disinfectant because they form an alkaline solution in contact with water.
When soap is not available, the WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative soap.
The correct hand washing method recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission includes the following steps:
wash your hands with hot or cold water.
Since water pools can be contaminated, drainage is recommended, and meanwhile, the water temperature does not seem to be affected by the variation in temperature.
wash hands thoroughly with soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when they are in the presence of soap than when they are in the presence of water.
Look for at least 20 seconds.
Massage creates a gel that helps remove germs from the skin, and prolonged massage removes many germs.
wash them thoroughly with running water.
washing in a sink can re-contaminate hands.
dry with a clean towel or blow dry.
Wet and dirty hands are more susceptible to re-infection. The most commonly affected areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and the underarms.
artificial nails and broken nail polishes can cause microorganisms.
It is recommended to use hand washing lotion to prevent dryness, as dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
"Various low-cost alternatives can be implemented to facilitate hand washing where tap water and/or soap are unavailable, such as: drawing water from appropriate holes in the drain or pit and/or using a basin if necessary in developing countries. Water-saving alternatives such as water-holding "Tip-taps" and other low-cost alternatives are available in situations of water-supply shortage (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries)".
TPI-TAP is a simple hand-crafted technology using a wire-wrapped hook and a little water and a barrel of soap.
While effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, there is some controversy about the most effective way to dry hands in public bathrooms.
A growing body of research indicates that paper towels are more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted at the University of Westminster in London, funded by the paper towel industry, and funded by the European Thesis Symposium on Air Hand Dryers to compare the hygiene standards provided by paper towels, hot air hand dryers, and the most modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing hands and drying them in the hot-air dryer, the total bacterial count increased on fingers by an average of 194% and on hands by 254%.
Drying with the jet-air dryer showed an increase of 42% in the total bacterial population on average in the foam pads and 15% in the pads.
After washing hands and drying them with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced by up to 76% on average fingerprints and 77% on the palms of the hands. Scientists conducted tests to determine the potential for contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment due to each type of drying method.
The air dryer, which had a blasting speed of 180 m/h (650 km/400 mph), was capable of dissolving microorganisms from the hands and appliances and contaminating other bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a hot air dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper dryers have not shown any signs of microbial spread. A 2005 study by TÃœV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes were observed in the bacterial count after the hands were dried.
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers were compared to paper towels.
Hand washing of hand sanitizers is another option when traveling when soap and water are not available.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand sanitizer has been a requirement for a long time after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in preventing infection in a hospital setting (1846).
electronic devices remind hospital staff to wash their hands by sending a reminder.
in relation to their use, one study found a lower rate of disease.
Medical hand-washing is done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water or gel to massage and massage each area of the hands.
hands should be rubbed with fingers.
If there is dirt in the fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can remain on hands in water, it is important to wipe them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After it dries, close the water with a paper towel (and open any outlet doors as needed).
this will prevent the hands from being contaminated by those surfaces again.
"The purpose of hand washing in the health care setting is to remove and prevent transmission of germs ("germs") by the relevant microorganisms".
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that handwashing is becoming unacceptable in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, thus spreading germs.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures reduced catheter-associated bleeding rates by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a paper showing regular hand washing and hand sanitizing in health care settings.
The organization's hand hygiene draft can also be found on the website for public comment.
A critical review was conducted by Whitby et al.
If a declaration of compliance with the control regulation is required, commercial equipment can measure and verify hand hygiene.
"The World Health Organization has defined the five seasons of hand washing".
After exposure to blood/ bodily fluids
before the pollution-free action, and
After patient care.The addition of antibacterial chemicals to soap (either disinfectant or antibacterial soaps) indicates a hand washing agent.
Such removal may be necessary before surgery or in settings where antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming more common. To perform surgery, you need to 'rub' your hands, a handheld faucet that opens and closes without touching hands, dry towels to dry your hands after washing, some chlorhexidine or iodine, and other antibacterial tools to wipe dry brushes, and to clean under fingernails.
all the ornaments must be destroyed.
This usually requires washing the hands and forearms for 2 to 6 minutes.
Longer test-times (10 minutes) are not required.
During the cotton milling, water on the cotton should be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
after the hand washing, the hands are dried with a clean cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs: it is best to wash your hands before and after taking care of a sick person or to use hand sanitizer.
In hospitals, for the control of staphylococcal infections, the greatest benefit from hand hygiene was found to be 20% of the initial washing, and a very small additional benefit when hand washing frequency was increased to more than 35%.
Washing with plain soap compared to antibacterial soap is three times more likely to cause foodborne bacterial infections. Comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution for an average of 30 seconds to hand washing with antibacterial soap, hand washing with alcohol reduced bacterial infections by 26% over antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile from hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include training of staff on hand washing, the addition of alcohol-based hand washing, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in various health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is seen as a cost-saving, health-promoting and nutrition-friendly tool.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes achieving universal handwashing practices challenging.
For example, while there are cheaper options for building hand washing stations, in much of rural Africa there are few hand washing facilities near each private or public toilet.
However, lower hand washing rates may also be the result of ingrained habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and educating about handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to lasting behavioral change in the public.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social advertising campaigns were not.One example of promoting hand washing in schools is the three-star approach by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap and water, among other hygienic requirements.
When minimum criteria are met, schools can grow from one to three stars.
Building hand wash stations can be part of hand washing promotion campaigns to reduce disease and infant mortality.
Another example is the global handwashing awareness campaign that is trying to change behavior.Due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged handwashing emoji to be promoted.
A few studies have looked at the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALYs.
However, one study found that encouraging hand washing with soap was more effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, including newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospital, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician working in Vienna, Hungary, and Florence Nightingale, a British nurse who was the founder of modern nursing.
at that time many people believed that infections were caused by the unpleasant odors of miasma.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of food poisoning and health-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 Swine Flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of washing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with "Good hand washing techniques" have been posted in public restrooms and buildings and at airports near hand washers next to toilets.
to wash one's hands of something is to refuse to take responsibility for it or to be a part of it.
In the gospel of matthew, the biblical passage where the pentecostal pilate washes his hands after deciding to crucify jesus christ is derived, but it has become a common phrase in some english communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to forcefully wash her hands to clean a paint intended to represent her guilty conscience in relation to the crimes she has committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
he also found that people who remembered or meditated on immoral acts were more likely to wash their hands more often and to use hand sanitizers than others.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to engage in other remedial actions, such as volunteering to do penance.
Religions prescribe hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, the use of water without soap to wash hands, is a hand washing system in many religions, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netelai Yadaim in Judaism, Lavo in Christianity, and Wudu in Islam.
hinduism, judaism, and islam all require that we wash our hands after using the toilet.
and hinduism, buddhism, sikhism, judaism and islam all require hand washing before and after each meal.
workplace risk management for covid-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are workplace safety measures that allow for the control and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk management at the workplace will be determined by the workplace and the type of work, based on the assessment of the risk of exposure to the risk sources, the transmission in the community, and the risk factors for the individual to develop COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure occupations are those occupations with low exposure to the community and low contact with co-workers, which requires basic infection prevention measures such as hand washing, keeping workers home if they are ill, and continuing with respiration and routine cleaning and disinfection.
Moderate exposure risk occupations are those who work with people who have no known or suspected contact with COVID-19 but who may become infected through ongoing transmission or international travel.
this includes people from the community, such as schools, high-density areas, and high-end retail locations.
Risk control for this group is to have a respirator and personal safety equipment that uses air filters with high filtration capacity, in connection with basic infection prevention measures, and if a person with COVID-19 is exposed.
OSHA considers the exposure of persons who are known or suspected to have been exposed to COVID-19 to be at high risk, with a very high risk if workers are collecting samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients while performing aerial sampling procedures.
The appropriate safety controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation and personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have many impacts on the workplace.
employees may be dismissed for illness, lack of consideration for others, and fear of exposure.
business practices may change, including what products are needed and how those products are purchased (either through queuing or delivery or through a drive-through service).
Finally, delivery of supplies to areas with high COVID-19 incidence may be disrupted. Epidemic preparedness and response planning can be used to take protective measures.
There are plans that deal with many workplaces and types of work, including source exposure, sources of risk from home and community, and sources of risk for each worker whose age is significant and who has a serious health problem.
They also explain the controls needed to avoid those risks and plans for potential outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The goals of the pandemic response are to reduce transmission among workers, prevent people from being exposed to high-risk health conditions, protect businesses and help reduce the negative impact on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the response will depend on the location of the business.
The disaster management process framework is used on the basis of the effectiveness of the management of the risks that threaten the safety of the workplace and the team.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be avoided, the most effective control methods are engineering controls, which are supported by administrative controls and ultimately personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls can isolate workers from work-related hazards, which is not based on the behavior of the worker, and may be a cost-effective method to implement.
administrative controls are changes to work policy or procedures that are made by the employee or the employer.
While the effectiveness of personal protective equipment is less than that of engineering and administrative controls, it does help reduce some of the risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected, applied appropriately (e.g. filters) as required by the worker, regularly and in an appropriate manner, inspected, repaired and replaced, and properly disposed of, cleaned and stored to prevent contamination or contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have a lower level of contact with the community and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces are frequent and thorough handwashing, advising people to stay home if they are sick, measures to cover breathing such as coughing and sneezing, preparing soft and dirty bins, being prepared to work on the phone and for shifts, encouraging employees to avoid using other people's tools, and performing regular workplace cleaning.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step to protect workers, customers and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people with severe respiratory distress, fever, fever symptoms, or other symptoms should remain at home for 24 hours until they are cured, but should not use any medication that reduces fever or other symptoms, and that sick leave policies should be flexible, allow employees to stay at home, and that employees be aware of these.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure concerns are those occupations that require frequent close contact, up to six feet (1.8 m) of people with suspected or known COVID-19 but are likely to be due to ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or if they have recently traveled to countries with high COVID-19 transmission.
This includes contact workers in places such as schools, high-population areas, and other high-risk retail shops. This and other high-risk groups include air filtration, increasing the amount of ventilation, introducing physical barriers such as plastic splash pads, and providing customer service through a drive-through window. Administrative controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging sick employees to stay at home, encouraging face-to-face meetings in virtual meetings, changing the regular shift, encouraging people to avoid unnecessary travel in the event of COVID-19 emergencies, encouraging people to stop their work in the morning or to stop their work at night, encouraging people to prepare and prepare for COVID-19 and other safety and health measures that may require them to be alert about their contact with the workplace and their concerns and reactions to COVID-19, and preparing and wearing protective clothing and other personal protective equipment, and preparing for and responding to emergencies and other health-related incidents that may cause personal injury.
Workers in this risk group rarely use respirators.
Proper surveillance to protect a person from becoming ill on an aircraft and other passengers would include isolating the sick person with 6 feet of distance, providing the sick person with a service and a face mask, or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when they are sick or sneezing.
Flight personnel should wear disposable gloves when handling sick passengers or when handling bodily fluids or contaminants, and additional personal protective equipment should be worn if the passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biohazard bag and contaminated items should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. Risk control controls for commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, include postponing travel in the event of illness, as well as self-isolation and notification.
The best approach is to conduct health surveillance in the quarantined individual's room. For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends short-term closure and cleaning or disinfection, regardless of whether an infected person has been in the school building and community transmission.
In the case of low to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling travel programs, dispersing meetings and learning through other school-based attendance, stopping large gatherings in cafeterias or cafeterias, increasing distance between chairs, separating arrival and departure times, barring non-essential visitors, and identifying segregated offices for children who show symptoms to be screened.
With high community transmission, extended school closures may be considered an option in addition to social distancing.The CDC estimates that the immediate health risks to law enforcement personnel working in their day-to-day jobs are low.
Law enforcement officials who must contact individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during stressful hours, workers should disinfect their work belts and equipment with spray or wipes before using them again or using household items, and should store and dispose of used PPE and containers and laundry clothing that are used in the prescribed work process.
OSHA identifies some health care and mortuary workers as high or very high risk.
High-risk occupations include health care delivery, support, laboratory and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This is a serious risk if the workers are working on aerosol-emitting processes or with suspected COVID-19 patients.
procedures that generate air particles, intubation, saline procedures, bronchoscopy some dental procedures and tests or preventive sampling assembly.
High-risk morgue work includes work that prepares the bodies of people suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of their death, which means that these people are at high risk if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these jobs include placing people with suspected or known COVID-19 in isolation, which is when they work in a job that releases fine particles into the air.
A special negative pressure respirator may be required for some health care or mortuary facilities.
Samples should be treated with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients stay in a confined quarantine facility based on suspected COVID-19 infection.In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for those whose work involves working within 6 feet of people suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who work in airborne environments.
In the United States, NIOSH has approved the N95 face mask respirator, or it should be used internally, as part of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes qualification testing, training, and health screenings.
Other types of respirators offer greater protection and enhance comfort of operation.While WHO does not recommend full masking, COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends that only personnel who check at entrances wear surgical masks.
For people engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients or in the transport of patients who do not have airway bags, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, eye masks or face masks and gloves.
If the air conditioning process is performed, the surgical mask will be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
In response to the global shortage of PPE, WHO recommends reducing the demand for PPE through telemedicine, physical restriction, i.e. open windows, to ensure that only people who need immediate care are allowed to enter, use personal protective equipment for a limited number of staff, care for multiple people without removing a single respirator, and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and monitoring for people who are showing signs of distress.

This month we find ourselves in a unique situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our global human connection and our responsibility to each other.
While we have no precedent for the challenges, our best response lies in global solidarity, collaboration and community building that is at the heart of this agenda.
The friendships and interactions we have seen among our employees in emails, phone calls and chats are proof of how great it is to work with such wonderful people.
i consider myself lucky to have known one of you as a business associate.
last week someone told me about the appreciation of our work.
It is a great sign of how much our world is returning to Wikipedia and how important it is to make this resource online and available to everyone.
Your work allows this, whether you take the job, our colleagues get paid, or our communities are safe.
Our world needs the information that Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it has a meaningful impact on the world.
This mission and your role are so important that we may be making some major adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
The first meeting of the newly formed Governing Body was held in the spring of 1929.
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
in that speech, we were thinking about what would be the right answer to what we are facing and what we need to do to make our organization sustainable in the meantime.
we wanted to avoid the stress and continue our mission for as long as possible.
If you want to call back, that's fine.
For all employers, temporary workers and temporary workers:
The daily work hours will be 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
i'm not saying it's a vacation - if you can work overtime, the assignment can be beneficial.
But our world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to take care of your family, go shopping, or visit a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
we do not track your time.
if you do, do not work.
it is not necessary to say this, but we will say it.
No sick days or PTOs are required - just inform the management staff and ensure your team has coverage of key work areas by reviewing schedules and calendars.
(If you test positive for COVID-19, please inform Brian to help with support and to ensure that your case receives proper attention from the administration.)
people are paid in full every hour.
We have done so in the past, and we will continue to do so for our contractors and our employees.
everyone will be paid for normal hours of work.
this includes those who are unable to work due to illness.
if you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a means of transferring their anxiety from the world around them.
especially at times like these, our work can be very productive.
again, it's about taking care of yourself.
Our question is what to expect and how to prepare, by talking to your administration.
some jobs are considered essential.
there are some things that we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR processes, trust and welfare, and fundraising teams (among others) do a very critical job that may require additional support.
in all departments we start a process that will make the present purpose and focus on what is necessary for our purpose.
We're all busy, and we're all focused on what's most important.
procrastination is no longer harmful.
We do not plan to double the working hours to complete the emergency work after this pandemic.
no longer expect you to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines.
we accept that circumstances change, and we work to set new goals and timelines when needed.
What is created on the APP?
To adapt to our new reality and daily work schedule, we need to adjust the timing of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our goal is to extend our 2019-2020 plan, which will allow employees to schedule their work in a sequence that is mandatory, to care for themselves, to care for their families, and to meet the needs of those who want to work reduced hours.
This extension of time will significantly reduce the current planning pressure and pressure on the entire organization.
We will inform our staff to the board next week and will let representatives and teams know what the next step is as soon as we receive the information.
Thank you for your leadership in this time, APP Team.
Office environment, vulnerability and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precaution, we have hired a de-virus staff for the San Francisco office.
They have made every floor infection-free by using the same type of disinfection mix used in hospitals, including the Angda reception and the elevator banks that reach our floor.
The building has its own maintenance process using products that keep tenants safe.
we are confident that the office will be fully occupied by the time we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, and they have shared their COVID-19 process with us and our employees in DC.
Last week, our DC office followed San Francisco's lead to work entirely from home.
As some of our NYC staff know, we are also in talks to rent space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home for the first time.
Our long-term remote coworkers know that it can be a fix, and they wanted to give you some tips:
Limit the length of the meetings to one or two hours.
If longer periods are required, consider how to divide the periods into smaller periods over several days.
clearly define the meeting, have an agenda, and send reading materials in advance.
Set video as the default, which includes tools like Google Docs and Zoom, and facilitates direct collaboration and communication.
Have someone to lead each meeting, monitor chats and speakers, and help you take notes (or collaborative notes).
If you want a handy headset, email tech support.
Use your security fees to sue.
Join the #remoties channel to discuss remote work with your colleagues.
The HR team is looking for ways to handle the increasingly distributed workload in the foundation by providing webinar-based ergonomics guidance.
Last week, we asked community donors to cancel Wikimedia Foundation events, such as edits, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
we have informed them that we understand that requesting cancellation may make it difficult for them to meet the aid agreement that was previously agreed upon, and no one will be penalized for delaying or changing these goals.
Next week, we will be doing more tutorial follow-up at Wikimania and other regional and limited community conferences.
The reaction from the global community is not only sad but also a sense of relief at the uncertainty caused by the vision of focusing on their own community, Wikimedia and others.
Speaking of the future, CRT is working on creating a Meta-Wiki About page, with the goal of managing the pressure on the community and continuing to engage with them.
Closely monitoring cases associated with COVID-19
We will be sending out invitations for a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share more new information, answer your questions, and spend time on our relationship.
We are all in this together and we will help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can find information from this email and other COVID-19 related information on Office Wiki.
CRT refreshes these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
In addition, we are working to establish ongoing contacts with workers, especially those working in the most severely affected countries.
Please do not contact CRT to work with them if you need help with travel, conditions, a major line of work or coverage challenge, or any other issues.
We are here to provide support and to enforce it as required.
If you have any questions about keeping a wine secret, please email Bryan Judan - Director of Operations for Human Resources Worldwide.
none of these changes should be seen as a loss of our work.
But this time, it's a recognition that our work and our lives need to be adjusted in ways we've never seen before.
Supporting each other is part of the process, and to continue to work together, we need to support our activities, and provide services that support our world.
our planned work will be ready when the time is right.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for the critical work that will come in the weeks and months ahead.
You are all vital to this, and we want you to protect yourselves and your families so that we can be better when necessary.
Now - wash your hands and avoid touching your face!
Catherine is a member of the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme found on the cell surface (cell membrane) of the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 is a promising drug target for the treatment of vascular diseases by reducing the level of angulestin-II and inhibiting the activity of the related angulestin-converting enzyme (ACE) by increasing Ang (1-7). ACE2 serves as an entry point for some coronaviruses into cells.
the enzyme in humans is usually called hACE2.
Angiotensin-II is a zinc-containing ironloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein is classified into the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I, and the enzyme has an active domain, so it is present on the surface of the lungs and other internal organs.
ACE2 is cut from the cell interior by another enzyme called the outer shade, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the form of urine.
ACE2 is found in most tissues: ACE2 is mainly found in lung type II alveolar cells, small intestine, vascular and vascular smooth muscle cells in most tissues, and in vascular smooth muscle cells in most tissues.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, the stratum, the hypothalamus, and the cerebrospinal fluid.
The main function of ACE2 is to be a relative counterbalance to ACE.
ACE binds to the angiotensin I hormone and to the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 also cleaves the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine, which is derived from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) in the spore and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotestin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can degrade several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the SLC6A19 membrane, a neutral amino acid transporter, and is known to be associated with Hartnap disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for some coronaviruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the S1 proteins of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 cell membranes bind to the domains of the ACE2 enzyme, allowing the virus and enzymes to be transported into endosomes and circulation in cells.
This entry process also requires a preliminary test of the S protein on the host seminary processor TMPRSS2, which is currently a drug in research. This has led some to speculate that it could help fight infection by lowering ACE2 levels in the cell.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing with standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A published July 11, 2012, systematic review and meta-analysis found that use of ACE inhibitors had a 34% reduction in pneumonia compared to controls.
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was similar in patients treated with ACE flu, who had a higher risk of pneumonia, especially in patients with cerebral and cardiac failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with pneumonia-related deaths, and the effects were low with overall pneumonia risk.
Human ACE2 (rhACE2) cell is being considered as a novel treatment for acute bronchial pneumonia, a respiratory failure disease caused by liposaccharides that improves bronchial hemodynamics and oxygen retention in piglets.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the effective (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for conditions with no classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or circulating angiotensin II elevated.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help identify people (contacts) who may have come into contact with an infected person to monitor or locate the process.
In some government departments and provinces, a number of applications have been prepared or submitted with the help of official government support.
Several frameworks have been developed to build touch tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially with regard to systems based on tracking app users' geographical location.
Options for minimal interference include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would work together to integrate Bluetooth-enabled devices into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed a mobile app that will alert citizens if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.
The app is used in over 200 Chinese cities. TraceTogether is being used in Singapore.
The app is developed by the local IT community, released as open source, and will be provided to the government.In North Macedonia, the government has launched StopKorona!, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure and respond quickly to those who are infected.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is pending approval to be placed on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracing app is in a high-speed development phase, and that similar apps are planned to be launched in Ireland and France in the next few weeks ("StopCovid"). "
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients in Moscow who are not expected to leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed several problems, including false positives that could be applied to application-based systems and if the app's adoption is restricted to a small segment of the population.
"To address concerns about the spread of malicious or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has introduced restrictions on which types of businesses can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting them to only public or well-known organizations".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concerns about the implications of widespread surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially that the intelligence infrastructure created to deal with the global coronavirus pandemic will collapse once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for a ban on such surveillance.
The organizations have declared eight preconditions for government projects.
The monitoring should be legal, necessary and affordable;
The length of the control and monitoring shall be the length of the sentence;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes only;
data security and anonymity should be protected and monitored based on evidence;
Digital censorship should avoid exacerbating bias and neutrality;
any sharing of information with third parties must be disclosed by law;
There should be safeguards to prevent unfair interference and violations of the rights of citizens;
"meaningful engagement" is required by "all relevant stakeholders", including public health professionals and the organized group. the german keus computer club (ccc) and reporters without limits (reporter ohne grenzen) (rsf) have also provided checklists. "
If the Google/Apple plan does not address the issue of persistent monitoring, it is possible to remove the monitoring method from their systems.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the ability to download apps and disable tracking.
In Israel, network-based surveillance has been approved.
Web-based solutions for accessing data in a dry environment have potential problems.
However, not all systems with a centralized server need to have access to private local data, and several privacy-preserving systems have been developed that use centralized servers for communication only (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to search for contacts.
Instead of using a single purpose app, the system collects tracking data from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, and combines it with text message delivery of these infected individuals.
In addition to using this data, the government has made the location data available to anyone, due to significant changes in data privacy laws as a result of the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries including Germany have considered using centralized and private protection systems.
As of April 62020, the details have not yet been released.
The idea of privacy and tracking connections is a previous idea with a long history of human search, dating back to at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, privacy-friendly solutions were used, namely Bluetooth low-power (BLE) solutions that show how close they are to other phones.
However, PPP-PT is a collaborative combination of both centralized and decentralized approaches and includes a single protocol, with the combined protocols being the district-specified privacy protection close-range tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers, (TCN, fka contact incident numbers, CEN), privacy privacy confidentiality protocols, and mobile communication tracking (PACT), among others.
The personal data identified in these protocols will not leave the device, and all related data will be processed on the device.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or road crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
"Apps Gone Rogue: Protecting Individuals' Privacy in a Pandemic" was released on March 7, 2020. Another similar effort was the SafeTrace platform, developed at the MIT Media Lab by privacy technology developer Engma MPC.
SafeTrace is a secure hardware technology that allows users to share sensitive locations and health information with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was formed to bridge the gap and create a global network of monitoring and alerting applications, which are essentially the same course and are divided among groups that mainly combine protocols.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the release of the BlueTrace protocol, which is used by the official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a communications initiative in which they will protect privacy based on a combination of low-power technology and privacy-protecting databases called Bluetooth.
They also published detailed descriptions of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be released in three phases:
List of device implementations that allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps
This function is implemented directly to iOS and Android, as well as Apple's plan to simplify integration and eliminate continuous monitoring problems in the same way after the first implementation of system updates to spread the threat to the system.
Drug recycling (also known as drug reconditioning, re-distribution, recycling, or therapeutic switching) is the practice of using a different approved drug from one that has already been approved.
This is one line of scientific research currently being conducted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other areas of research include COVID-19 vaccination and plasma transmission. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 potential therapeutic proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
The testing of these mandatory sites involves the development of a reasonable and effective antiviral drug for COVID-19 proteins.

b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine that is a booster against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are several ongoing trials to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization said that it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus associated with the virus, to be available for at least 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase-one safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major pandemic worldwide in 2020 that will lead to massive investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI report, which was completed in April this year, was motivated by the development of tracking, speed, manufacturing capacity, deployment at scale and global reach.
As of early April 2020, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms are under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main targets of the platform, which has been upgraded to Level I security studies, include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (stage I enzyme and vaccine recruitment: cancinobiologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
In April of this year, scientists reported that 115 total vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, 78 were active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others were announced, but the data in the public domain was considered scarce (at the planning or design stage).
Phase I-II trials perform a primary and safe immunization test, typically randomized, site-controlled and determined at multiple sites, to determine a more accurate and effective dose.
Phase III trials include additional participants, including control groups, to evaluate the efficacy of the drug in preventing disease, and to provide a moderate dose of adverse drug reactions.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in development (as of April 2020), 74 have not been tested in humans (still in preclinical research).

that is, they are useful beyond the disease they protect against.
Further random testing in Australia is looking to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Research investigating the vaccine efficacy of animal models related to COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and other non-human monkeys, indicates the need for time to develop and implement standardised safety procedures for the use of Level 3 biosafety live viruses and for global collaboration.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no known cure or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs that were developed to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against MERS.
With the advent of MERS, it was hoped that existing SARS research would lead to the development of a useful standard vaccine and a treatment for MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine had completed phase-I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in development, all viral-containing vaccines, two adaptive-based (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have sparked conspiracy theories behind COVID-19 and the idea that a vaccine is known and already available.
Posts on various social media sites indicate that patents are in place for genes and vaccines for other types of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
the time between the appearance of symptoms and the first five days can vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some improvements have been seen in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from more than 210 countries and territories, and more than 153,000 deaths have been reported.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from the disease. The virus is mainly transmitted through human contact, usually by sneezing, coughing or talking.
these droplets are produced during respiration and usually fall on the ground or on a body instead of being transmitted over long distances.
people can also measure by touching the contaminated soil and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on dry surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can be transmitted before symptoms appear and later stages of the disease spread (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs.
People suspected of having the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear a mask.
Recommendations for the use of masks for the general population may vary, with some authorities recommending their use, some recommending their use and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The spread of the disease has been recorded locally in most of all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may show flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty arousing, and facial or lip bruising. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms occur.
Most often, symptoms of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as tingling, runny nose, or sore throat are seen.
Gastric ulcer symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been reported in varying percentages.
In China, some cases were initially reported as only chest blockages and physical disabilities.
In some, the disease can develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
this is called the latency period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms will show symptoms within 11.5 days from the date of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood, but early evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The number of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that about 20 percent of confirmed cases remain undetected during their stay in hospital.
The National Health Commission of China included initial cases in the April 1 case, including individual cases. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were of the same type as at the time of testing.
Both acne and measles can carry a wide viral load.
Speaking out loud will cause more droplets than normal speech.
A study in singapore found that uncovered coughing caused droplets to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has found that aerosol transmission is possible and that air collectors test positive for viral RNA in the outer portion of the human genome.
Some medical procedures, such as stunning and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory tract to be airborne, allowing respiratory air to be expelled.
Although there are concerns that it could be transmitted through contact with the infected, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people are showing symptoms. However, it can be spread before symptoms appear, and the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person infects two to three others in total. The virus can survive on dry surfaces for hours and days.
Specifically, the virus was detected in cardboard for up to one day, in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to 99% copper for up to four hours.
However, this varies with humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used correctly. Soap products degrade, destroy, and release the immune coating of viral fat from the skin and other tissues.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate (an anti-operative) are not effective.In a study in Hong Kong, intermediate-dose samples were taken two days after the start of hospital treatment.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the highest viral load, while the sixth showed the highest viral load when the patient was tested on the second day.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first identified in three people in Wuhan with severe acute respiratory syndrome, accompanied by pneumonia.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks down its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most vulnerable organs to COVID-19, as the virus infects host cells through the enzyme angiogenesis enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special membrane/glyoprotein called a peploomer to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart failure is the most common form of the disease, accounting for 12 percent of all cases admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China.
During the progression of the disease, cardiovascular symptoms are more likely due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system problems, but severe myocardial injury is associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High levels of thrombus (31%) and hormonal thrombus (25%) were found in ECI patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with post-prostate.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a specificity for ACE2 expressing respiratory cells to express respiratory function, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hypertension symptoms.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretory T-cells have been shown to be associated with the recruitment of IN-6-secretory burst monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infections have also been reported on autopsies.
the world health organization has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the rapid-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is performed on respiratory samples collected with a nasopharyngeal swab. However, a nasal swab or a stool sample may also be used.
The results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples separated by two weeks and the results are of little value.
Chinese scientists have identified and sequenced the coronavirus, enabling laboratories around the world to develop separate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infections.
As of 4 April 2020, antiviral tests (which can detect active infections and if a person has previously been infected) were on the rise, but were not yet widely used.
Chinese experience in testing shows that only 60 to 70% is accurate.
The US FDA approved the trial for pre-care-diagnosis on 21 March 2020, later that month.The trial guidelines, released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, suggested methods to identify infections based on clinical features and influenza risk.
Dual multi-layered floor-to-ceiling openings with a background, origin and back-end spread are common in earlier infections.
Sub-domain predominance, hypertrophy (thickening of the lobular septum with variable alveolar filling), and exacerbation may be observed as the disease progresses.
There is little information on the process of micro-injection and changes in the disease caused by COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy:
Macrophage-pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism and pneumonia are also known as
Four types of viral pneumonia can be identified:
Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, hyperplasia of the lungs, infections of the worms, lymphatic radicular tumor, and the formation of a giant cell in the middle
Severe pneumonia: spread by alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar oxidase.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoglycemia.
Healing of pneumonia: inflammation in the alveolar cavity and the middle fibrosis of the lung
blood: distributed intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic response
Prevention measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a mask when coughing or sneezing and using a mask in the inner chamber if there is no mask.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after any coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face masks in public settings to limit transmission from a person who is a carrier of the disease.Social distancing strategies are strategies that can help reduce contact between infected people in large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also include requiring people to stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19".As the vaccine is not expected until 2021, the key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to slow down the spread of the disease, known as ""slowing down the spread of the virus"".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are clearly dirty, before touching the nose and sneezing, or before and after eating.
Only when soap and water are not readily available, it recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. In areas where hand sanitizers are not commercially available, WHO has provided two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isosopropoethanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial growths in alcohol; it is not an active ingredient in hand antisepsis.
glycerol is added as a humectant.
people apply for financial assistance that may include hydrotherapy, oxygenation, and other vital organs and support for the injured.
The CDC recommends that people who think they may be infected with the virus wear a light face mask.
Exocrine Mantle Oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory problems but benefits are still being seen.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive therapies may be helpful for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized people with COVID-19.
Doctors and respiratory therapists in the United States have complied with medical recommendations from various agencies to use the independent database IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For tests, some medical professionals recommend the use of papetamol (acumanoinone) in conjunction with ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus when performing ventilation procedures such as inhalation or manual ventilation.
Health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19 recommend that the individual use standard precautions, precautionary measures, and airborne precautions in addition to placing the person in an airborne infection escape room (IIRR). The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment during an outbreak.
Recommended gear: PPE clothing, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has approved them as masks for use under an emergency use license (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for use outside the product description.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks or recommends the use of homemade masks as a last resort.
Most COVID-19 cases are not as severe as those requiring mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but minor cases are severe.
The type of respiratory infection in individuals with respiratory problems associated with COVID-19 is actively being studied for people in the hospital, the disease can be relieved by either a high nasal flow or a two-stage positive airway pressure.
It is not known if either of these two drugs has the same effect on chronic pain.
Some doctors prefer mechanical ventilation when available, as it reduces the airborne particulate matter circulation compared to elevated nasal drainage. Bubonic plaques are most common in older adults (over 60 years of age and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which has led to a sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization, which has limited the capacity of the health system to cope.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
30% of people in hospitals with COVID-19 in China are admitted to the ICU.
As acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and becomes more difficult to oxygenate, mechanical air becomes more complex.
Ventilators that incorporate air pressure control modes and higher PEEP are needed to maximize oxygen supply while reducing the risk of respiratory-associated lung injury and stroke.
high PEEP may not be available on old air ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be very promising.
Although it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs under investigation have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced stages of development.
antiviral drugs can be tested on people with severe disease.
The World Health Organization has proposed that volunteers participate in trials of efficacy and safety of potentially effective treatments.The FDA has granted temporary approval for FDA testing in cases where an individual's life is in grave or immediate danger.
It has not evaluated the clinical studies needed to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the pandemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can use intelligence to find 'close contacts', thus identifying the possibility of exposure to the disease.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If an incident is detected, the app will not only self-isolate but also alert local health authorities.Facial data analysis on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track and identify people who have been infected.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to identify and protect those who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared enhanced phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, an agency of the German federal government to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to identify those who are avoiding quarantine.
The Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said that 40% of people continue to travel in any way, according to mobile phone operators.
The German government conducted a study with over 42,000 participants over the weekend for 48 hours.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also issued a global call for innovative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may face quarantine, travel restrictions, adverse effects of treatment, or risk of infection.
BBC Rory O'Connor quoted as saying that "social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic collapse are the perfect storm that is affecting people's mental health and wellbeing".
Other common respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold, may have mild symptoms with little or no symptoms.
Mild cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe or severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Depending on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infections for COVID-19, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19.In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by invading the lungs.
In the most severely affected, COVID-19 can cause rapid respiratory distress, fainting spell or multi-organ failure to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, unhealthy stomach lining, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Unhealthy testicles, particularly an increase in prostate length, accounted for 6% of COVID-19-related hospitalizations, while abnormal kidney function was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people exposed to COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the first symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days were spent in hospital.
However, patients who were moved to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the earlier cases, the study measured 14 days, with a median of six to 41 days from the onset of symptoms to death.
According to a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), male deaths increased by 2.8% and female deaths by 1.7%.
Historical examination of post-mortem lung samples showed the presence of mobile fibroxide in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung imaging appears to be that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart disease was defined as a high-risk ruptured or heart failure.
According to data from the United States in March, 89 percent of people hospitalized had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical supplies and the socioeconomic status of the region can also affect mortality.
The death rate varies according to the situation because of these regional differences, but it can also be due to strategic issues.
Counting minor cases could cause a much higher death toll.
however, the death was due to previous cases, meaning that the current death rate has been reduced.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and require intensive care, or approximately 2.4 times more than smokers. Concerns have been raised about the long-term duration of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority confirmed that the sampa capacity of some people who recovered from the disease was reduced by 20% to 30%, and that the damage to their organs was detected by scans.
This may lead to post-recovery, post-high-level follow-up symptoms.
It is unknown whether the past infection as of March 2020 will provide effective and long-term resistance in people who are recovering from the disease.
The incidence of the disease is seen to be based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but positive tests for coronavirus have been reported after later recovery from COVID-19.
these cases are thought to worsen rather than recur.
The virus is thought to be of natural and animal origin through naturally produced and exacerbated infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection will be entirely human-to-human.
The first 41 confirmed studies of COVID-19 published by The Lanet in January 2020 indicate that the onset of symptoms is December 1, 2019.
The World Health Organization reported the first cases of the disease on December 8, 2019.
Various measures have been taken to measure the death rate.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the rate of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the initial outbreak, and community characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the laboratory-confirmed deaths for SARS-CoV-2 disease were assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 and the non-laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease was assigned the COVID-19 codes U07.2 in the study of clinical or related diseases.The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of cases divided by the number of people tested in a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/ 2,240,191).
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals found to have died from the disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), the percentage of individuals infected (treated and untreated) who die from the disease.
And these statistics are not limited by time until they decide to vaccinate certain people.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the small Italian village of Castiglione d'Adda, the epicentre of the outbreak, which has a population of 4600, 80 (1.7%) people have died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through carnival events, and resulted in relatively few deaths, but also spread to younger people, so that all COVID-19 deaths could not normally be classified as such.
In addition, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
It is estimated that about 3% of donors in the Netherlands may have antibodies.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
The death rate is higher in studies in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in their 50s, with the gap between men and women only approaching 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Gender-related diseases, such as hypertension, may be more likely to cause death in men than in women, and smoking may be more likely to cause death in men than in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sexually-related data related to COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women and are at high risk of exposure to the virus.
The official name of the disease will be COVID-19 on February 11, 2020, according to the World Health Organization.
According to the Director General of the World Health Organization, Theodorus Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the coronavirus was first identified as a virus, disease, and infection in 19 people on 31 December 2019.
In line with international recommendations to avoid discrimination, the name was chosen to avoid allusions to a particular geographic area (e.g. China), animal species or human group.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization also uses the terms COVID-19 virus and virus causing COVID-19 in official communications.
"The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus"".
The virus and the disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus when they first appeared in Wuhan, China.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the use of 2020-nCov and 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and the disease, in accordance with the 2015 guidelines on the use of spaces in the names of viruses and viruses in acute respiratory illness.
The name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were assigned on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in traditional supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials such as nasal sprays and air fresheners.
In one example, an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was able to deliver in the required amount of time, but the local startup Blast-Nurse printed 100 valves needed per night in one day.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, information on the origins, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease has been rapidly disseminated online.
Humans appear to have the ability to spread the virus to other animals.
The study found no evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
there is no cure or vaccine for the disease.
Global research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the Solidarity Trial to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of four existing antiviral chemicals with promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor receptor to enter cells, which was previously used by SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccine modalities under investigation.
First, researchers aim to create a universal viral vaccine.
The use of this type of virus, whether it is active or dead, is to respond to the human body's immune system in response to a newly emerging COVID-19 vulnerability.
The second strategy, sub-vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that targets specific subunits of the virus in the immune system.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus bind to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is a new approach to the creation of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines).
Among these approaches, experimental vaccines must be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, a first vaccine clinical trial began in Seattle with four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code derived from the virus that causes the disease.An antibody has been proposed as a candidate for the development of a vaccine against SARS-COV-2, although this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
They were reviewing previously approved therapies for malaria, including four approved studies, including seven for hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of the recycled antiviral drugs are Chinese research, reported in late April in nine phase III trials in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates has been conducted.Reflovir, chloroquine and hydrochlorodonequine, Lopevi / Rutavinavir and Lopevinavir / Rudonavir in combination with interferon beta are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 by multiple existing antiviral drugs.
There is concrete evidence of the effectiveness of the discount as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was first studied in China in February 2020.
However, calls have been made for a review to evaluate the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology pointed out that while a daily dose of one gram is recommended, a double dose could be more dangerous and fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the Medical Board of China issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroxaine for treating people with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include the use of intervirone, ribavirine or umfenovirine against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for additional use in the Vivo study after demonstrating a low-pressure concentration for SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that high protein consumption of trans-cell protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the induction of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydrochlorotriquine with or without artemisin have major limitations that the medical community finds to prevent these treatments without further study.Oseltamivir does not inherit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytoquin cyclone may be complicated in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine wave properties. Tocilizumab was included in the medical guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after completion of a small study.
After showing positive results in patients with severe disease, a national phase 2 randomized trial is being conducted in Italy.
It is designed to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in the injured, by combining it with the Sam Fritstin blood test to identify the Itokin wave.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist has been approved by the FDA based on studies on the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy, a treatment for steroidal reversible isotoxin release syndrome published in 2017.
To date, there is no approved, controlled data to support that toxilazime is an effective treatment for CRS.
Immunocell-generated recovered from COVID-19 is being tested as a recommended method of vaccination for people who need to be screened and stored for antibodies.
This strategy has produced unconvincing results for the SARS experience.
Virus neutralization/control is a proposed approach that could mediate the immunization against SARS-CoV-2 with a neutral antibiotic.
However, other mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory cellular cytotoxicity and/or phytobiotosis are possible.
Other types of indirect anti-infection therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are on the decline.
The production of a sick cell, a fluid component of the blood of patients who have recovered from the disease and which contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased to deploy it more rapidly.
