Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is now widely accepted, but it also gives details that fossils generally don't, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists believe that the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides a glimpse into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed handle called a rachis, but possess other features of feathers - branching and crooked - the researchers conclude that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, compared to other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature control or parade. According to the researchers, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult specimen, not chicken plumage.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage, not the plumage of a juvenile.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in the form of a halo and is made up of many small particles.

Traditionally, voting in France is low-tech: the voters are isolated in a booth, indicate the candidate they have chosen on a pre-printed sheet of paper and put it in an envelope.
Once the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, he or she places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter's list.
French electoral law is pretty strict about procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside and that no envelopes are being put in at the beginning of the voting except those of the duly registered and eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police chief, said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened is closed temporarily so that emergency services can remove the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony could be distorted because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts consider the publication of the photos as potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they circulate photos and so on of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, has indicated to reporters that until the prosecution is brought, no further comment will be made.
According to leaked information, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine is claiming based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics that are supposedly discussed are the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both sides, and the Jordan Valley.
After the signing of the agreement, Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agreed to implement such a presence for only five years.
The arrows in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was observed and its efficacy assessed.
The Australian Sport Shooting Association's hunting program has recruited qualified volunteers in partnership with NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of 'Conservation and Heritage' at the National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot were given detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelli was sworn in to the nine-member new provisional electoral council yesterday.
This is the fifth Martelli County Board of Elections in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former electoral commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the commission.
Violent protests have sometimes been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
There have been about 60 reports of malfunctioning iPods, and overheating has been reported, causing a total of six fires and light burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "a real regret".
Mariana was rocked by an earthquake at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Response Service reports no damage to the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 on the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and adults, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographs were later replaced by an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Lygins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate preterm births in his spare time.
His research shows that if you administer the hormone, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lungs.
Government investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
A tribute to Luna and fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen, my first manager, and she died on the night of the two moons, quite unique, like her, a strong woman".
"Luna is as strange as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll miss her...hope she's in a better place", commented Dustin Goldstones Runnels.
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
After all, 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and take part in three events at the British Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have put his fitness in question.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to manage his pain, because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed after comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political bullshit and nonsense".
There's been speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
The FAA says NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly longer distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to allow flight controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and to determine the exact location of aircraft.
There is no additional transport and no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and there is no car park or car parks on site with the possibility to leave the vehicle.
The fear of a lack of transportation has raised the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
The emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador is reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in only two generations, although it was thought that this process took much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwinian chinch, the middle ground chinch (Geospiza fortis) and the non-native cactus chinch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any shape, it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn as a thin wire, which can be braided and twisted, then forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted paintings in books known as illuminated manuscripts.
This is the pH of a chemical substance, and using the juice of a cabbage, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is, the juice changes color.
The amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances and then shape them into a ball with a clean wet hand.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and it will feel a little weird, and it will form something like a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected by a complex sewer system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, the remains of sewage systems were found.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women in mixed company gathered together.
You use a satellite when you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away.
The satellite in space picks up the call and instantly bounces it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light that we see.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in an incredible way, and the greatest thing that we have thanks to the bicycle is a much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
And finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) feeding on far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, the special job each cat takes on, which keeps her from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called pride.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males with blood ties, along with up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related, a big family of sisters and daughters.
Priduses act much like wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and just as deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make huge leaps, and pull with the strength of five able-bodied men.
The tiger is in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that are known to howl.
The tiger's roar does not resemble the lion's roar, but it is more like the utterance of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by using their sense of smell to ask where they have been on the earth.
With their night vision, they see very well in the dark and move very quietly, but the survivors hunt their prey by blending into their environment and leaping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The native population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, most of our food is plant food, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other Mosasauri.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp razor teeth, along with an extra set of teeth in the upper part of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a tongue split, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could even have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex could match it.
Although most of their food is familiar, the Romans also had a number of strange or unusual delicacies, including pigs, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called the sleeping giant.
The other difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate, sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together, lying on their sides while they ate.
It's not possible that ancient Roman dishes included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a prime temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of no consequence.
Most of the Jewish family's life is spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just shelves facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and travelling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it his name.
But regardless of its discovery, by this time Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each of the countries was "Scandinavian", the peoples, kings, customs and history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland were very different.
You might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you've seen the movie National Treasure.
It's not a treasure map, although there's something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, and are shown face down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at first, after it was created, the large parchment (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It's most likely that the notation was added as a label.
With the D-Day landings and the ensuing battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It's run by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies entered southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and French forces had liberated southern France and moved on to Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large and significant group of people, working and living together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civic, and is related to the Latin civis, or citizen, and civitas, which is city, or city-state, and this in turn determines the size of society.
City-states were the ancestors of nations, and culture in the context of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge over generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and natural diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States for the first time formed a weak central government, with, according to the Articles of Confederation, Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to tax, and, lacking a national judicial or executive branch, it relied on government agencies, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
It also has no authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The clauses required the unanimous consent of all the states to be amended, and the states treated the central government so casually that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, as a geographical concept, it is often referred to as an "archipelago"
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, changing local grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, the Inquihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the borders of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they came to be.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues today.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35 mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its image format is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the sides of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest denominator of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Equal to or very close to this ratio are very common formats (e.g. APS group of formats).
The much abused and often derided rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the photo into thirds vertically and horizontally (See example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, already rich and powerful, was being criticized.
The Christian religion has bound the European nations together for more than a thousand years, despite their differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
It is a fundamental Christian principle that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist for that very reason.
The centrality of the church in Rome lasted for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money makes many wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Britain began a naval blockade of Germany soon after the outbreak of hostilities.
Although this blockade violated the accepted international law, codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries, the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain mines international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response from its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, an attitude of pacifism and isolation prevailed among most citizens and nations.
Nations wanted to avoid a war situation again in the future after they saw the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War.
To take a job with the Edison Company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Butcheler (his manager at his previous job).
In ancient China, there was a unique way to show different periods of time; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
Between each of the two dynasties, there was also a period of unstable divided provinces, the most famous of these being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, and in the struggle to sit on top of the grand palace of Xi'an, thousands of people died.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the classes were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the military, because instead of the division in the army being based on class, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in things beyond this worldly life, and for meditation he often visited the cave that became known as the Hira on Mount Nur (the light).
The cave itself, surviving through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists, and once you're inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing else is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the late pharaoh.
In the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, on the Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is dedicated to Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are dedicated to his wives and family members.
The upward sign looks like a V, and the downward sign looks like a wire rod or a square with no bottom.
Up means you start at the top and press down on the bow, and down means you start at the fret (where your hand holds the bow) and then pull it out.
An upward bow is usually softer, and a downward bow is stronger and more confident.
Feel free to put your own signs, but remember that the printed arrowheads are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women in the marketplace.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At one point, one of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The Filipino people paid the military costs of the US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The US colonial regime forced them to pay taxes to cover much of the cost and interest of the bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
The super profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, the major acquisitions of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of Templarism, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the Order.
The period during which the events occurred is commonly called the Late Middle Ages - the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The true Middle Ages are preceded by the Early and followed by the Late, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice - from the technological impulse or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two common ideas are shared by most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself goes on a path that far exceeds cultural or political influence, or technology itself affects inherent rather than socially conditioned societies.
So, for example, one could say that the motor vehicle inevitably leads to the development of roads.
A national road network, however, would not be economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership has also led to greater rates of road accidents, necessitating the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a great element of cultural determinism, which was pioneered by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures emerged that were associated with geography, and that, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury dates from about 400 BC and continues until about 1100 BC.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and silk, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and the 14th century.
Early clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication, Western styles can lag 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was developing its own style, and as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothes, which was one of the great developments of the time.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce enough food for the sole needs of the farmer and his family.
Market agriculture is a simple, often organic system, often using preserved seeds from the same ecological area, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The signs that define a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most commonly used tools to illustrate the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, ill-treatment or intentional violence, were not socialized by adults during the child's growing up period.
Some untamed children were kept in captivity by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the rejection of severe intellectual or physical damage to the child by the parents.
Wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within the physical constraints) that almost entirely resembles that of the particular caring animal, as well as its fear or indifference to humans.
Whereas project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scale building is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing new learning, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, like the little man with the staples in Microsoft Office.
There are virtual skeletons built into the software that are designed to ask questions, to suggest and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not supportive, nurturing and educational, but it is happening.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything needed that was missing in the home they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the use of the gratification approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and long-term relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Imey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it's claimed that a person can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks points out how, despite the fact that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able to perceive the sincere attitude.
He even suggests that similar abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of variations that have been expressed.
Segregation and recombination are mixing the variations back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its need for amino acids through available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: depression of growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of legumes, but these are difficult for us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (thermite, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all of this, it shouldn't be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up at your usual sleep time and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that can bring you back to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself turning off the clock in your sleep, you can put it across the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is in inverse proportion to the amount of tension in his body and his spirit.
The less stress, the more positive life force, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and our own stress and negativity are the only things that stand in the way of achieving that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is extended by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana way of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy for enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations and mantras.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment of the mind is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years, and a real battle was fought by mercenary armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat to the Romanian beachhead and reconsider its organization.
These plans, however, became invalid almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having conquered the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to transport huge numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The task of a naval fleet is traditionally to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most recent and most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably conquered Britain, like the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goats, usually children or young men, similar to the more commonly known shepherd.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the railroad consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to reach greater speeds and to pull greater loads than the rougher roads of the time.
Tracks were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective with an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known way of moving was by walking, with humans walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecine fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living with more care for the environment, join the environmental movement and even become activists to reduce some of the negative impacts in the future.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been made greater by overcrowding and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After it was passed by Congress on the Fourth of July and signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, the handwritten copy was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as the 'Dunlap broadsides'.
The document was first read publicly by John Nix in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
Dunlap's 25 single-sided copies on large sheets, which are still known to exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Because they have feathers and can fly, a lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But for the birds that still look like dinosaurs, there are many things.
They have feet with claws and scales, they walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and they lay their eggs.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't always manifest immediately, but symptoms such as vomiting are so common that it's easy to diagnose.
The presence of an open container with a drug or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this poison.
The term beetle is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from the familiarity with woodworms, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Like the flying bugs, the common bugs are colorless, living in their host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
When an adoption is made, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple can be the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, and in fact, the scientific method is the guiding principle of most scientific research.
It's not just experimentation, although to eliminate some of the possible hypotheses, experiments are used, asking questions and using guides is also accompanied by scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and especially with the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge in Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are more than responses to external periodic signals have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perform a free-running cycle even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading hypotheses that DNA is genetic material was the experiment done by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they tagged either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a wide range of effects.
Only mutations in cells in the germ line can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive to people with an interest in visiting natural areas in order to admire the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
Activities that can be done here include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as learning about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, to get to work, people travel from small country towns by car, and they pass others whose work destination is the place the first ones just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is to some extent connected to and maintains a transport system through private cars.
That this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years is now being shown by science.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day, are transportation engineers just incompetent, or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
As the behaviour of drivers unfortunately cannot be predicted with 100% certainty, studying the flow of traffic is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus traffic flows have some logical sequence and can be represented approximately mathematically.
For a better view of the flow of movement, the relationships between the three main characteristics are defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design and ultimately operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid their enemies more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backwards over their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The dragonflies and the one-dayers are the only insects that cannot fold their wings today.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many hold the opposite view - that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying over eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some points six miles wide.
The Amazon provides as much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the rush of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza remained unsurpassed in size and technical superiority of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those working in the state.
All the Vatican's subjects are Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Metals are considered to be elements like calcium and potassium, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, which in turn is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So when it appeared, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was reduced to a lower status and use.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens and don't have to touch pencil sharps.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The plutonium bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which is why they tend to decay with little or no thrust.
The lunar surface is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more sea on the near side, because the crust is thinner there, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness are focused on finding out what makes people respond or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by reaching adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation are the two popular theories of content.
Generally speaking, once managers start managing their former colleagues, there are two behaviors that are likely to emerge: on the one hand, there are those who try to remain "I'm one of our boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty enforcing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and demanding responsibility from people.
You become, at the other end of the spectrum, an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often causes a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team, to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and inventiveness can be shown.
As a result, the organisation's work process to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new innovative process serving the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organisational learning and knowledge sharing.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that is used to help organizations achieve higher outcomes.
The physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition comes from the neurobiological data, which narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The link between pathology and brain behavior has supported the research of scientists.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a great importance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch in computer science, dealing with the learning, behavior and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such problems have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system, which is embedded in several home computers and video game software applications, is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs.
Excursions are a big part of school education, and very often a teacher would like to take his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from a school in North Carolina create a web page for their trip to the state capital, every year this page is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketchbook.
While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author, to avoid criticism, has started to strive to improve his writing.
Also, blogging 'forces students to be more aware of the world around them' and the need to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to be interesting and clever (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the regular school day.
Through appropriate use of blogs, students can be empowered to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material in the context of other people's writings, students can define their own positions, and also outline their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming and bilingual capital, home to a number of art galleries and museums that offer a glimpse into Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and further north are the pristine natural beauties of Muscocca and surrounding lands.
All of these things cement Ontario as the paragon of typically Canadian for foreigners.
The large areas to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabitable deserts.
One population comparison that surprised many: the number of African-Americans in the United States is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and is a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are linked to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands and it had a great influence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the "City of Good Hope", the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south.
Women: It is recommended that any traveling woman declare that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can give rise to situations which they consider to be harassment, in which they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for your position (cultural differences or not, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Beyda, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who set up their trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagine, ceramics, leather goods, nargile and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the volcano Niragongo, which flooded most of the city's streets and especially the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma must be studied to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Mount Nirago volcano, along with some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a "bodo-bodo" (motorcycle-taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
timbuktu, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has gained use as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, though it has become a tourist attraction because of its reputation and its airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates PBS show "Special Wonders of the African World".
The city is strikingly different from the rest of the country because it has an Arab look rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and the Crocodile River is its southern boundary.
The park spans 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 separate ecoregions, each of which has a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Generally all South African national parks require daily fees for park admission and conservation.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider worth visiting.
The row of buildings that line Hong Kong's skyline resembles a glittering staircase that rises above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast of Kowloon.
Most of the developed area of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, you'd better start there.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) off the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and this part of the forest, which is in Indian territory, is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, with almost one-third of this area covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the Inter-Regional Bus Station (behind the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumeng, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of traveling short distances, such as to Paro (No 150) and Punakh (No 200).
The Oiapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapok River to connect the cities of Oiapok in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapok in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 metres, the length is 378 metres, with two sails of 3.50 metres wide.
The bridge was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be commissioned in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran√≠ were the most important indigenous tribe in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who have survived by hunting, gathering fruit and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its distinctive character and identity since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and individual polo players in the world.
The biggest annual tournament is held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo for news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP) with a value equal to one British Pound (GBP).
The money can only be exchanged at a bank located in Stanley against the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and US dollars are also often accepted within the Stanley credit cards.
In the outlying islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, but British and American currency may be used; speak to the hosts in advance to find out which payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevid√©o is south of the equator, it is summer there, when in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; during the summer months, normal temperatures are above +30 ¬∞C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combined wind and moisture make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, be at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how obedient they may seem, buffaloes, deer, elk, bears, and almost any other large animal can strike.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so don't intrude on their personal space.
In addition, be aware that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking flavored food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia, the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1850s.
In the harbour in 1889, a scandalous naval battle took place when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Ma'u's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of the Supreme Leader Tupua Tamase Lealofi III.
Because Oakland is crossed by two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor area) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all are protected sandy beaches for swimming, and most have shade under the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located near the port of Waitemata, on the outskirts of the expensive Mission Bay and St Heliers areas of Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number one". It is not a heavy beer, but is pleasant and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are a lot of French wines to sample, but New Zealand and Australian might do better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
The idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians, but espresso is black, cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many of the walks to the reef are year-round, and reef accidents caused by any of these reasons are rare.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cube-shaped jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the town, and can occasionally be found outside this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their main habitat is along the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although you may find other accommodation options, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast included, airport transportation, or even combined airplane and hotel packages.
They may also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the overwhelming majority of participants decide to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be near the event, you'll have to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember, even though the music of the main stages may be over, there may be festival stages that will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping spots for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as for those most affected, crossing the ice is a rather awful noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Usually casinos put a lot of effort into making sure that guests spend the maximum amount of time and money, there are generally no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
To keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in the building, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as smoothly as on clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to make you stranded.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or hail, and by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, frost and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is almost continuous throughout the year.
The safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the ultimate destination for many visitors.
The term 'safari' in popular usage refers to a journey over land to explore the amazing African wildlife, specifically the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the cars, and a good view is obtained with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "wildlife walk", "tourist safari" or "walking") is a walk of several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement of the season was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the regular ones costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing on wet clothes can help them dry, and many hotels have a washing iron and ironing board that can be borrowed even if the room is empty.
If you don't have a backhoe or don't want to wear socks, you can try using a towel if one is available.
Do not allow the tissue to become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn).
Water can be purified in a variety of ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you're worried, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them in their native habitat.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals in themselves that can forcefully injure or kill people are not normally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often passing through isolated outlying areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous or subsequent sections, where they are usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h) and yet strict adherence to them is more important than elsewhere.
Interestingly, though, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and Bavarian pastries are quite rich and varied, similar to those made in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples being put in a cake year-round, and cherries and plums being eaten in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want some small, yet rich, pastries, try those that, depending on the region, are called berliner, pfankuchen or krapfen.
Curry is a dish of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be either "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan curry is often used; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
But when used without further definition, the term usually refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is widely spread in the archipelago, and includes many simple spicy dishes, and the predominant flavours preferred by Javanese are hot peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The arches are supports for the rider's feet, which hang from both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrups, he will be dragged if the horse runs away.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a stream and smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety grilles that allow the stallion's skin to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley - the best destination for climbers in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with an abundance of large granite walls and canaries.
The trails feature breathtaking views from the summits, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes amid the boundless potential of the walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending on snow with a ski or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, better known as ski booms, planning entire holidays related to skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first sporting ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski tourism.
They are similar, but usually do not include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being on steep terrain and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Look at the ski trail as a tourist trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly more distance than if you walk  but you will very rarely reach the speed of skiing without a heavy backpack on supported tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent states, and under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area does, however, function somewhat like one country in this respect.
While in the territory of this zone, you can generally cross the borders without passing through the passport control points again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen Member States, thus saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques, but some tax agencies define antique items as being over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be considered antiques, even though they are not as old as antique mass-produced goods.
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture around reindeer farming is important for many other crafts.
Even traditionally, however, not all S√°mi have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have survived by fishing, hunting and the like, with the deer being predominantly agile animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern trades, and tourism is a lucrative industry in Sampi, one of the areas where the Sami live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the word Gypsy is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate notions about the Romanian people.

American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The meetings are nothing more than a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the main term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social problems or loss of human life.
Anywhere in the world can have severe weather, and its manifestations are very different and can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather conditions include blizzards, snow, ice and sandstorms.
Travellers should take into account any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these can affect any travel plans.
Any person planning to visit a country that may be designated as a war zone should receive professional training.
The address of a local company will likely be provided when searching the internet for a course on a hostile environment.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, but in much more detail and usually in conjunction with practice.
The course is usually 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid activities and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but there is little publication dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning a sex-change operation abroad should ensure they carry valid documents for return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports to persons of undetermined gender (X) or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to abide by these documents is also a variable.

Transgender people who are about to undergo surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Dead currents are the backflow of waves that crash onto the shore, often at a reef or something like that.
The reverse flow, due to the underwater topology, is concentrated in several deeper sections, and there can be a rapid flow to the deep water.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which is probably impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere where you won't be caught again, or you might want to wait for rescue, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The return shock occurs more quickly than culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had a relatively easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their own.
When you come home after living abroad, where you've adapted to a new culture, you've lost some of your cultural habits at home.
When you first moved to a foreign country, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that newcomers had to adjust.
People may not expect that for travelers returning home patience and understanding are also needed.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for the children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
You usually hear the sounds of tourists and vendors, and the story of light and sound is like a fairy tale.
The sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are represented on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations claim the South Shetlands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, with King George Island and the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas as the largest island.
Others include Livingston Island and Izmata, where there is a spectacular natural harbor due to the flooded caldera of a still active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the peninsula bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then rise again to form a 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, carved by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Ridge, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with Vinson Peak reaching 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In remote places, without cell phone coverage, your only option may be a satellite phone.
The satellite phone does not replace the mobile phone in general, as you need to be out in the open and in direct view of the satellite to be able to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions requiring remote and voice data.
More information on how to contact this service can be obtained from your local telephone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to skip a year is to travel and study.
It's especially popular among high school seniors, giving them a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the year you missed would improve your chances of enrolling in higher education in your home country.
There is usually a 'training' fee to enrol in these education programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boating. 'The land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, located in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't have to have a yacht in the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats and kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where one boat for every seven or eight people is lost.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is 1 to 40).
Most prestigious Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you land using the excursions organised by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all and the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have experienced a traumatic event or have never flown before.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not unlike the personal fears and hatred of other things that a very large number of people have.
For some people, understanding the way aircraft operate and what happens during flight can help overcome fear of the unknown or of lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly, and often time is of the essence for business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller companies this was a problem.
If they sent things by air, on some routes, unloading and going through customs could take days.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as checked baggage, which is against airline regulations, which is your case.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a fat wad of money for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This, however, is not cheap: in principle you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business economy fare and eleven times more for first class!
In general, it doesn't even make sense to look for business or first-class discounts on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a substantially higher price for the privilege of going somewhere quickly and comfortably, and to be charged accordingly.
The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the separation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldavian Republic, which, although having its own government and currency, is not recognised by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
With a population of about 3.7 million people, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Surrounded by mountains and situated on a vast bay, the once ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center.
Broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers alternate with traditional red roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere is closer to Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsk has a panoramic view of the nearby island of Eusturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan only, since it is the first official language by law.
At the same time, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
In the metro, regular announcements are made in Catalan only, but the automated system announces unplanned interruptions in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

The rusty appearance of the Parisians will quickly fade if you show a little courtesy.
The National Park "Plitvice Lakes" is a dense forest of mainly beech, spruce and fir with mixed alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the variety of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes, there is an extremely wide variety of plant communities.
The area also sheltered an extremely diverse range of animals and birds.
Rare species of fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and deaf-mute, along with many other common species, can be seen
During their visit to the monasteries, the women are obliged to wear skirts below the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide gowns for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same logic, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
Clothes can be borrowed from the supply at the entrance, but they are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
As in similar areas in the Mediterranean, Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is pa amb o: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available product such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" - "You", are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.

These observatories before modern ones are usually obsolete and are used today as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem even in its heyday as it is today, they're usually located in cities or on campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built in today's times.
Most modern survey telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good weather.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum flowers are the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the Imperial court.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by nonbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians throughout the world.
It's a tradition to spend Easter night out in the open to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it's also possible that it represents a pre-Christian spring fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with the congregation often starting a spirited celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that arrived on the islands originally came here by swimming, flying or sailing.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, the mammals were unable to cross the road, which made the giant tortoise the first herbivorous animal of the Galapagos.
After the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, many mammals were brought there, such as goats, cows, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the Sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost day and night.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you too will be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
The suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or rank.
Workplace harmony is paramount, with an emphasis on group efforts rather than the promotion of individual achievement.
