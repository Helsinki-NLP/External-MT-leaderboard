Not only does this confirm the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs were stunned, but it also provides details about what fossils could not have been in general, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the fur of this animal was brownish brown above, pale or carotenoid below.
The find also provides a detailed look at the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed skeleton called a rachis, but have other features of feathers  spines and rays , scientists have concluded that rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or for courtship. According to the scientists, although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult individual, not the papillae of a young.
Although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the feathers on the specimen are those of an adult, not a young papyrus, according to scientists.

They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeological team, also at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech, with voters going into a separate room and putting a pre-printed sheet of paper with their candidate's name in the envelope.
When the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts an envelope into the ballot box and signs himself on the voting list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those that bind duly verified and counted voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the entire process, and in the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision in accordance with special procedures.

She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be wasted because her image has been published on a large scale.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish courts operate differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee claims that "journalists are heading in a dangerous direction by publishing pictures of suspicious people".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecuting, indicated to reporters that it would not comment further on the case until at least charges were brought.
The document allegedly relates to a border dispute that is being claimed by Palestine based on the state of the borders prior to the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other subjects that are supposedly discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is considered sacred by both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has a requirement for a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while Palestine agrees to maintain such a presence for a period of five years only.
The shooters in the supplementary pest test were to be under the strict supervision of the foresters, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the conservation and heritage park at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation were given comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday introduced a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) to the office.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended a pre-agreed resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the massive protests against the regime that began in October.
In some cases, violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been held since 2011.
Some 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating were reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, the government agency METI reported that Apple had informed it of 34 more cases of overheating, which the company called "slight".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report 'really regrettable'.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (on Friday at 21:19 Greenwich mean time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there is no indication that a tsunami is coming.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Along with the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early.
Then the photographers took over after an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would speed up the maturation of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, the so-called "black boxes", on Wednesday.
The allies also gave up on Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. She was my first manager. She died two months into the night, which was kind of like her, quite original. She was a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented, "The moon was as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's doing well up there".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard communicated her belief that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
At the extreme, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and also the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts arose about his fitness.
He couldn't take the pain medication he needed because it's forbidden at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people had confirmed the invention by early February using other hardware and software, with this announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water on Earth, along with organic matter that can make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately identify the aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no other mode of transport available, no overhead trains stop at Wembley and no parking or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns about the lack of traffic increased the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species has been able to evolve within two generations, although it was thought that the process would take much longer, thanks to crossing the endemic Darwin's pine tree Geospiza fortes with the migratory cactus tree Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes, such as being rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into thin wire that can be twisted and twisted, beaten and rolled into boards.
It can be made very thin and can be glued to other metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "Luminated Manuscripts".
It's called a pH chemical, and you can make an indicator using the juice of red cabbage.
The color of the cabbage juice depends on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry tablets together and then form a ball with your clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands will start to react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange feeling and the creation of a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in the homes of Greek Minoan towns on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women shared a mixed society.
To talk to someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, which is then instantly reflected back down to Earth.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
To get a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a huge rocket, more than 100 feet [30 m] high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
This has given us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey - from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, or specific area or task, for each of the cages, which prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of all feline animals, living in large groups called herds.
The herd consists of one to three related adult males and up to 30 females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion clusters behave like wolf or dog clusters, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other feline animals) and are also very deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, Tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times as hard as a powerful man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar with its mighty voice, but rather a few snarling screams.
The ocelots are fond of eating small animals, occasionally catching monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, but the vast majority of the animals they hunt are considerably smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and search for animals to eat (benefit) by scent and smell of the places they have been.
They are very good at seeing in the dark with night vision and also very subtle in their movements, hunting their prey by blending with their surroundings and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (such as when they move across mountains or a river, or when they move to a new island so they cannot easily get back), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the original one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like members of other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
And the name of this process is speciation, which just means the development of new species, and speciation is an unconditional outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes and to make our clothes, and most of what we eat is plant-based, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the most powerful predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were set with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of climates, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a fork-shaped tongue, and it could have fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it could even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, not even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex.
While many of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual dishes at feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called a plush.
Another difference is that poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, while rich men preferred shared feasts where they ate food while lazing on their side.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly could not have contained ingredients that would not be introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia until centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the deity.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which was open only to priests.
Sometimes the temples included specially constructed pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Home wasn't that important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The average Hebrew family spent most of their lives under the bare sky.
Women cooked in the yard, shops were just countertops open to the street, and houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found a new land and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian", they have many differences in people, kings, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie The Templar's Treasure Hunt, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days, a large parchment document (75 by 62 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the record was merely used to mark the document.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was dominated by the French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned on Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly larger group of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civic, and this word is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that also defines the size of society in some way.
Urban states are the ancestors of nations. Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of the cultural trace and the uniform expansion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, thirteen states created a rather weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, the only component of which was Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress relied on state agencies to enforce all its laws, but they often did not cooperate.
Nor did it have any authority to rewrite tax and tariff laws between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, along with the national football team from Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheel-skating, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international events and Olympic events.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping/grouping of islands that Japan has, Japan is often considered an 'island' from a geographical point of view
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailed around the island and wrote the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company builds a base in southwest Taiwan, begins transforming native grain farming practices, and employs Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three basic structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1975, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for photographs worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from the image sensors of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format is surprisingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format, divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio, is thus said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS group formats) are equal to or close to this cross-sectional ratio.
A very commonly used, but also ridiculed, rule of thirds is a simple one that creates dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
He argues that the most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united the countries of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds should be used for these purposes.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question its principles.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it succeeded in disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties of the past two centuries.
Britain conditioned international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, creating danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was little reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine war.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations.
After the world saw the horrors and atrocities committed during World War I, nations desired to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the United States with four cents, a book of poetry and a letter from his manager at his previous job, Charles Batchelor, who recommended him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each historical period of China or each family that was in power was a dynasty that was written into history in a distinctive way.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms era, which existed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a brutal war was fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, and thousands died fighting for the highest position in the great palace of Sian.
Many social and political phenomena are observable, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from self-government to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were available to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of ranking by class, they've switched to caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond earthly life, and he often went to meditate in the cave that became known as Hira, on Mount Noor (light).
The long-surviving cave itself provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Lying atop one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to get into it at all, even if you know where it is, because once you're in the cave, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis, also known as the Giza Necropolis, is located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The upward-sliding mark looks like a V and the downward-sliding mark looks like a knot or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and press the pin, while down means you should start at the frog (the place where you hold the pin with your hand) and pull the pin.
The upper part of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower part of the bow is firmer and more durable.
You can write your own tracks, but remember that the printed notes are there for musical reasons, so you should usually keep them.
On October 6, 1789, a market crowd drove the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, back to Paris from Versailles.
They were traveling back to Paris in a wagon, accompanied by an angry mob of screaming people who threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of the coach open.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of the royal guard, who had been beheaded at Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to cover the bulk of the expenses, and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government was funneled through the bank houses to Wall Street.
It is clear that the huge profits made by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the love originated.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the epoch of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally dated around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of concepts from the development of new technologies or the technological imperative to its narrow meaning that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself is going through a process that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology 'affects' societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one might argue that motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for healing injured bodies.
An important element of Romanticism was cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to geography emerged that were compatible with society and were better than arbitrarily set laws.
As Paris is now considered the fashion capital, Constantinople was in the feudal period of Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began sometime around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Early clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slow communication channels, styles in the West may have been 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was developing its own style, and one of the greatest inventions of the time, brought with it by the Crusades, were the knobs, which were used to tie clothes.
Self-sustaining farming is farming carried out with the aim of producing the quantity of food that is needed exclusively for the subsistence of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system that uses its own seed deposits  originating in an ecoregion  in combination with seed-seeding or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures connect like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterised by age, ethnic origin, social class, geographical location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often show their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws on several unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unhappy, or intentionally abused and not socialized by adults as adults.
Some unruly children were restricted by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the parents abandoned the child because they could not cope with his severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others were said to have raised animals; some were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a wild child is raised solely by animals other than human beings, his behavior (within physical limits) is almost identical to that of a particular animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the 'scaffolding' strategy goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a tool to help people who are learning to experience new things, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The curriculum can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is also a form of curriculum, but he is also a little office clamp in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scans are internalised in the software, and are primarily designed to challenge and explain too complex procedures to a student that he or she would not be able to handle on his or her own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and learning, and yet it is happening.
We see it as the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is designed to provide children with everything that was missing in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in the case of the theory of use and satisfaction.
For example, it is assumed that learning and socialization are important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
In researching the reactions of the public to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified 'personal engagement' and 'lasting relationships' as motivating aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-rays and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
More specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting micro-apparitions, it is possible to determine whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks in his work The President's Speech showed that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately judge the sincerity of speech.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the group of variations.
Segregation and recombination mix variations between these two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
If you do not, the consequences will be serious: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest sources of protein available were probably the leaves and legumes, but they are hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
You can do this simply by using a relatively silent alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
However, if you put off the alarm clock during sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) to get a person to get up and urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person has is indirectly related to the tension in a person's body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can reach enlightenment. The only obstacle is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it spread through the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically very simple, and it includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the energy of kundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, aerobic exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, whereby the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. As the war ended, these two allies were divided in opinion precisely because of the convergence of systems, processes and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to take another 40 years, and it was actually fought through proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive wall had been broken and the only hope for it was to retreat and change the layout along the Romanian outpost.
But these plans were dashed almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers violated the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Nonaggression Treaty, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral, and entered the eastern regions of Poland, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the Navy has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, but at the same time, to prevent your enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to move troops and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
And at the same time, the German Navy tried to stop these movements, mostly by using submarines.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain, as would the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often herded by goat herders, often children or adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherd.
In England, railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were made of only parallel wooden boards, they allowed the heavy horses to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the more rugged roads of the day.
The railings were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place, but it was later found that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron band on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused the wooden wheels of the chariots to wear out more.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron railways were introduced in 1767.
The first known form of transportation is walking, and humans began walking upright as early as two million years ago, when Homo erectus evolved.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not normally walk upright.
Two-legged specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to act more environmentally conscious, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some degree.
As in many cases, it's something like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should get to the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of human scientific and technological progress, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles are only making the problems worse.
After passing Congress on July 4th, a handwritten bill signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as Dunlap's Side.
The first public reading of the document was delivered by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap side-pages still exist and are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to in computer jargon as binary digits or bits.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, as symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The quickest sign of internal poisoning is the presence of open packaging containing medicines or toxic household cleaning chemicals.
Look for the label for the first aid instructions for this particular poisoning.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists for this group of insects in the formal sense of the word.
The name comes from the old knowledge of the bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the gills and the plates are non-dwarf, adapted for nesting or placed on their host.
With some 400,000 cases in the United States, multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the leading neurological disorders in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to make a so-called adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to use scientific methods to figure out how the world works, and these methods actually drive most scientific research.
But it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test that's used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific findings, including those in the field of psychology, were accepted.
The West gradually found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of Greek declined.
Many observed physiological and behavioral rhythms often depend critically on the presence of internal cycles and their formation through biological clocks.
Regular rhythms are documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and they are not just a response to repeated external signals.
The biological clock is an independent oscillator that will continue in a free-time cycle even in the absence of stimulus from the esophageal environment.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the main signs that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments labeling either the DNA phase with radioactive phosphorus or the protein phase with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on their type, the significance of the affected portion of the genetic material, and whether the cells are affected by germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, whereas other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks and studying ecosystem information.
Examples include sightseeing, photography, and the discovery of the organgatung in Borneo.
People leave small rural towns for work each morning and others pass by, working where the first ones left off.
In this shuttle, everyone is somehow tied to and supportive of a private car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has pushed aside the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human development for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail every day, is it just the traffic engineers' failure, or is it something more fundamental?
The traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and observing their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is challenging because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, and therefore traffic flows that can be roughly mathematically represented often behave consistently.
For a clearer representation of the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of terrestrial communications.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and more efficient in finding food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the dragonflies and the puffins.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; that the solar system moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, flowing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles in places.
The Amazon is the source of 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
The building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in either size or technical perfection.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were captivated by the relics of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest sovereign state in the world with the lowest population density.
In the Vatican, Italian is used for official communication and legal regulations.
Italian is also used daily by the majority of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since they are all found in nature in their natural form and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It looked like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, yet he believed that they would change into new substances in order to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
They are alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was introduced, it became a good friend to many people.
However, as newer writing methods appeared, the pencil was pushed to the side and used less and less.
People now leave links on their computer screens and never have to go near the dashboard.
Maybe just think about what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb uses the principle that energy is needed to make a nucleus with a number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy truck up a hill, and then when the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they're prone to break down with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km on the side of the head and 100 km on the side of the head.
It's thinner under the curl and thicker under the top.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, and the lava would be easier to get to the surface.
Content theory is about finding what drives people to behave or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become their own as adults.
These theories focus on what motivates people to want to do certain things and what forces them to do or not do certain things in their environment.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that can occur when managers start leading their previous peers.
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, determining accountability and also with accountability to people.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual with a sense of having to change everything that the team has done and do it your way.
The manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the whole team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams are governed by the same quality standards, but with slight differences.
Members of a virtual team usually serve as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, because their teams can meet in changing time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique feature of a virtual team is also the presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
Invisible team is a management team to which each member is subordinate.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?One of the goals of putting organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the executive departments of an organization, the door opens to creativity and ingenuity.
The process of collaboration within the organisation to overcome a barrier can then lead to a new innovative process that helps to meet the needs of the customer.
The organisation can be innovative, but first the management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
The film Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes like never before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
AI has a strong science fiction connotation and forms a major branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of robots.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Cases include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to life's problems.
Artificial intelligence is now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into several applications in home computers and applications in video game software.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and the teacher would often want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in a classroom with their classmates.
A great way to think about the trip and share experiences with other classes is to share the trip in a virtual way.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year, the website is redesigned, but the older versions are kept online to serve as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing.While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, audience presence will usually change that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces students to become more oriented to the world around them.The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to become more agile and engage with their interests (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs  enables students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; through active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writings as well as outline their own views on specific problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming 'bilingual' capital and offers visitors a wealth of art galleries and museums that represent its past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the unspoiled natural beauties of the Muskoka region.
All these and other things elevate Ontario as what foreigners consider to be fundamentally Canadian.
Large areas higher up in the north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that may surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it was adopted in style in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The era of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: All female travelers are advised to claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but only one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment, it's not uncommon to be watched, grabbed by the shoulder, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to hold your position (cultural differences or not, it's not ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and served as a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan renovated the city and named it Dar al-Baida, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts in the city named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as taganas, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a variety of geegaws, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, you should do some research before you go outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting situation in the province of Nord-Kivu.
The city is also a gateway to the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to observe mountain gorillas in Africa.
To travel around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorized taxi).
Timbuktu came to be used as a metaphor for relatively inaccessible, exotic and distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but it has a reputation as a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990 the city was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates during the PBS special The Strange Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country because its appearance is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) in north-eastern South Africa stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Here too, daily maintenance and entrance fees are paid as in all South African national parks.
The most profitable option is to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a select number of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the entire area of Hong Kong, and it is a place that is a major attraction for many tourists.
The set of buildings that make up the contours of Hong Kong could be compared to the glowing column graph seen from Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head to the coast opposite Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarban is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
Sundarban has been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The forests include not only mangrove swamps but also some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is wetland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a kingdom of the wild, and it is estimated that 400 Indian tigers and some 30,000 Axis deer are now found in the area.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially the one heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance, since intercity buses are often full.
Most districts are served by the Japanese Coaster minibuses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby towns such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the entire Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers span a height of 232 feet [83 m], are 1,378 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes 12 feet [3.50 m] wide.
The vertical light height under the bridge is 15 metres.
The Commission has also requested the Commission to provide information on the measures taken to implement the measures in force.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, and were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Obrovska provincia Indi", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with the original indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo courts in the Las Cañitas section.
Minor tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
Information on tournaments and the possibility of purchasing tickets for polo matches can be found on the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency in the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is set at the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within the Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards on remote islands are unlikely to be accepted, although both British and American currency may be accepted; check with holders in advance to see what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; normal temperatures in the summer months are above +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no special rainy and dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, wild animals remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they may appear, buffaloes, elk, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they need to be left alone.
Also, bear and other wildlife are attracted to scents, so avoid serving or cooking aromatic foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval misunderstanding in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering of people in the city led to the killing of the supreme leader of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The two harbours of Auckland allow for the existence of many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in North Harbor County) are located by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe to swim in, and most offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are occasionally crowded family beaches with plenty of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
Many French wines are available, while New Zealand and Australian wines could be more available.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're concerned, getting bottled water is not a problem.
The concept of flat white is foreign to Australians, with small black coffee being espresso, cappuccino being served with a high layer of cream (not foam), and tea being served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard, fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the competent authorities, pay attention to the label instructions and pay particular attention to the safety warnings.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the city, and occasionally outside of that time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most shark-like creatures are afraid of humans and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live primarily in the ocean, their normal habitat being the mouths of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the passenger the assurance that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels, but they also offer the possibility of booking other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport/airport transport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any suggestions for change or requests should be directed primarily to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
As for some festivals, the overwhelming majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
To get close to the action, you have to get there early to get camping close to the music.
Remember that while the musical performances on the main stages may end, music may play into the late night in some parts of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because walking on ice causes quite a lot of noise for those who are most affected.
Cruise in St. Petersburg includes a stay in the city.
Casinos usually make a concerted effort to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, often lacking windows or clocks, and finding the exit is difficult.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and as long as possible.
Since drunkenness impairs judgment, all good gamblers are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
The friction on icy and snow-covered roads is low, so you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you could get stuck in it.
The reduced visibility may be caused by falling or blowing snow, water condensation on windows or ice forming on the windows of the vehicle.
In contrast, in many countries ice and snow are commonplace, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a land-based journey to explore the beautiful African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are accustomed to getting close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen from a distance with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking or tourist safari or just walking) is a tourist activity that lasts for several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at various locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, with the 1964 games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you could have gotten into an awkward situation.
Cancellation conditions vary, but at the end of March most coronavirus-related cancellations do not exceed July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It can be expected that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the price of one standard ticket being around ¥7,000.
Even if they are not in the room, many hotels have a loaner and ironing board.
If an ironing iron is not available or if you do not like to iron your socks, you may try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the substance (this may cause it to become crunchy, and in extreme cases, it may burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water takes just one minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests which are not present in their home regions.
Pests can degrade food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or violently kill people themselves are not usually classified as pests.
Shopping in duty-free zones allows goods to be procured free of customs duties and excise duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it often passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: they are full of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - normally 56-64 km/h  and strict compliance with them is more important than ever.
Strangely, mobile phone service here is much stronger than on many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good, and Bavaria is quite colorful and varied, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples baked year-round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts, often combining the most popular cakes with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try the stuffed bun, which is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a herbal and spicy food, served with meat or vegetables.
We know curry as "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid used.
Inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a term that overlaps with the wide variety of regional cuisines that you can find throughout the country.
When used without further qualification, this term tends to mean a food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Java cuisine, now widely available throughout the island, includes a variety of easily tasted dishes.The predominant flavorings favored by the Javanese include peanuts, chilies, sugar (mainly coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The straps are supports for the rider's legs, which hang on both sides of the seat.
They provide greater stability to the rider but may also pose a safety risk as they can potentially trap the rider's legs.
If a rider is thrown off but has his leg caught in the saddle, he may be pulled if the horse escapes.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a fairly narrow smooth sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English, are fitted with safety bars which allow the saddle to fall off if the falling rider pulls it back.
The Cochamo Valley is a popular mountaineering destination in Chile, and for its diverse, huge granite walls and rock formations, it is referred to as the Yosemite of South America.
The views from the top of the shields are breathtaking, with climbers from all over the world constantly discovering new routes among the walls' endless potential.
Popular winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding involve skating on snow with skis or snowboards attached to the legs.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as ski fanatics, planning their entire holiday around skiing at a given location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.!
Cross-country skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norse opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backpacking, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
It is related (but usually not included) to alpine skiing and mountaineering, which is practiced on steep terrain and requires much tougher skis and shoes.
Consider the ski route as a similar tourist route.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover a slightly longer distance than if you were walking  but you will rarely reach the speed of running on a regulated track without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent states.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to complete visa applications and pass passport checks repeatedly.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to a certain extent as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without passing through the passport control points again.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen member states separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiquities, and some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are over 100 years old.
The conditions for determination vary across the world, and this age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products may be classified as antiques even though they are younger than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for Sam, and the culture of trade is also important for many other professions.

If the country you are going to visit is the subject of travel advice, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may want to consult the advice of other governments besides your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The information report provides only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
These views are often only vague, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Adverse weather and its varieties, which depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
Strong winds, thunderstorms, heavy rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of adverse weather events, such as storms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
We strongly recommend that travellers consider any risks that may arise as a result of adverse weather conditions in their area, which could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should attend training.
Just search the Internet for "Hostile Environment Course" and you'll probably get the address of a local business.
The course covers all the issues discussed in greater detail, together with practical experience.
The course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid instruction and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning a sex-change operation abroad should ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.

Transgender people should not expect to go through the scans before surgery without compromising privacy and dignity.
Back currents are the returning falls from waves that break on the beach, often at a cliff or similar.
Underwater topology allows the backflow to be concentrated in several deeper sections, where rapid currents can form up to deep water.
In most deaths, exhaustion can cause you to swim backward, which can be completely impossible.
Once you get off the stream, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether someone has registered you, you might try to wait for rescue.
The return shock is faster than the culture shock (the initial idyllic phase is shorter), lasts longer and may be more severe.
For travelers who have been able to adjust easily to a new culture, it is sometimes especially challenging to adjust to their original culture again.
After returning home from abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your customs from the local culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country would need to adjust.
People may not anticipate that travelers returning home will need patience and understanding.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and silence before the show starts.
Usually you hear tourists and vendors talking all the time, and the story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is displayed as a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
The pyramids depict different scenes, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with 16 still active in 2020.

A satellite phone may be your only option in remote areas where there is no cell phone coverage.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, and to make a call with it, you must be outside in a place with clear satellite visibility.
This service is often used in shipping, including cruise ships, as well as on voyages requiring remote data and voice connectivity.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.

Finland is a great place for boating. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and on coastal islands.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on islands and lakes.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaking offer a different experience.
Rowing is the national sport of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It's the same for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it's quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands, it's a 1 in 40 number).
Most Baltic Sea cruises also offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you have a few full days to visit the historic city, while you return to the boat at night.
If you are going to the shore only for a cruise by boat, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures include the German city of Berlin. As you can see at the top of the map, Berlin is not by the sea, and a visit to the city is not dependent on the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience, regardless of the age or background of the passengers, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that so many people have.
For some people, understanding how planes work and what happens during flight can help them overcome fears based on the unknown or the feeling that they have no control over things.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery, and time is often critical when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and smaller companies, the problem has arisen.
In the case of goods sent by air freight, unloading and pre-loading could take days on some routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so you're the one who comes in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to allocate a large amount of money to this privilege (or ideally to get your company to do it for you).
But it will not be cheap: you can expect to pay an estimated four times the usual fare for business class and up to 11 times the usual fare for first class!
In general, it is not worthwhile to seek discounts on business or first class flights from point A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain basic group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, the local language is Romanian, but Russian is very commonly used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.

Approach the site with the utmost dignity, with all the seriousness and respect it deserves.
Don't mess up the place by writing or scratching graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to communicate in Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and Spanish is spoken by virtually everyone.

There is a rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and tetra, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and shoulders.

All nouns and the personal pronoun Sie (Vy) always start with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and objects.
It also helps to simplify reading, but writing is a bit more complicated because of the need to distinguish whether a verb or adjective is used in the lower case.
Pronunciation in Italian is quite simple, because most words are pronounced the same way they are spelled

They're usually in cities or on campuses, because they were built in their heyday, when there was no problem with light smog, and they're easier to get to than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge devices in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The sight of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

Christmas is one of Christendom's most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-Christians and non-Christians throughout the world in Christendom.
Traditionally, you'll stay up on Easter night under the bare sky to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter mass on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with gatherings often held at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either came swimming, flying or swimming.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make this journey, making the giant tortoise the primary predator of the Galapagos.
