Welsh Assembly Members are worried about looking like 'Muppets'
There is a lot of panic among several Assembly Members about changing their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this panic is the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Wesh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from various political parties fear that the name change will be met with ridicule.
A Labour Party assemblyman said his party was concerned that the new title would "match Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Welsh: In Welsh, Twp means fool and Pwp means mole.
A Pled Assembly member said they as a team were "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party was "open-minded" about the name change but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and Mapete.
In this sense, the pronunciation of the Welsh character W is similar to the pronunciation of the Yorkshire English character U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently making provisions to start the name change process, said: "The final decision on what the terms of office of the Assembly members will be must be made by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change their name.
In June the Commission published the results of a referendum in which the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
On the status of Assembly Members, the Commission supports the Welsh Parliamentary Members, or WMP, but the MWP has the most support in the referendum.
Apparently, Assembly members are suggesting different options, but it will be difficult for Presiding Officer Elaine Jones, who is due to submit a draft of the provision in a matter of weeks, to reach a consensus.
The reforms will bring about changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including disqualification of Assembly members and design of the committee system.
After the debate on the provision, the Assembly members will have the opportunity to cast the final vote on what their status should be.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held to avoid a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor is a symbol of its claim to territory and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's president, George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is only a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent as Harlem's churches are smoking.
"The older people I spoke to said that historically there was a church and a pub on every corner", Mr Adams said.
"None of this today".
He said that the disappearance of the pubs is understandable.
Today, "human social interaction is different".
"Toilets are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where everyone goes on a regular basis".
In the case of the church, he is worried that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders think, and will go back to where they started, today or tomorrow.
He added that apartment buildings and condominiums could be built on the site of the church to house people who would not help the rest of the churches in the area.
"Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said. "And so they will speed up the closing of these churches because most of the people who come to live in these condominiums are unlikely to be church members".
Both churches were founded by white congregations before Harlem became a black-dominated metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left the church in 1930.
A black congregation that worships nearby took ownership of the building.
A black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martins, leading a boycott against retailers at A Hundred and Twenty Fifth Streets for refusing to hire and promote black workers.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when the residents of Father Johnson's parish planned to restore it, they arranged for the carillon to be built.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir at St. Martin's proudly dubbed the carillon the "Poor Man's Bell".
The expert who played the carillon last July called it something different: "a historical treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Nyong, an expert at the University of Michigan, added that it is the world's earliest carillon played by a black bard, played by Dionisio A. Lind, who was hired to play the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated case of architects and contractors hired by the general leaders of the church or the episcopal diocese.
The Vestry  parish governing body, which is made up of general leaders  expressed their concern last July that they thought the costs would shift to the Diocese of Vestry , although the Vestry was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
In California, 13-year-old Galda was injured after a shark attack while diving for shrimp.
A 13-year-old boy was injured after a shark attack on Saturday after he dived to catch shrimp on the first day of the shrimp season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7am in Beacons Beach near Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he heard the boy's cries for help while diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday morning and pedalled over to help him out of the water with a group of people.
Hamel said that at first he thought the boy was screaming for joy of catching a bald shrimp, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "He bit me!"
I was bitten!'
His voice was torn from his throat", Hamel said, reaching over to see the boy.
"I shout for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hamel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the attacking shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was not identified as a threatened species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
Officials have banned access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons.
Giles said more than 135 species of sharks are found in the area, most of which are not endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK market
Sensbury's is set to compete with Boots, SuperDrag and Debenhams in department store-like stores with stylish cosmetics and specialist support staff.
The giant eyewear will be launched in 11 stores nationwide as part of a strong push to enter the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, with more stores to follow if successful.
The investment is coming as supermarkets are looking for new ways to fill shelves once filled with TVs, microwaves and home decor items.
Singsbaris said it will double its lineup to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Easy, Tweetsman and Dr. Pop for the first time.
The existing cosmetics ranges like L'Oreal, Mabeline and Bart's Beige will have more space, with separate space for brands like shops like Boots.
The supermarket is launching its boutique makeup range with most products being vegan-friendly, which has become very popular among young shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be testing drop-off delivery at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and buying small amounts of food at local grocery stores mean supermarkets have to make extra efforts to attract shoppers.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlets need to look like department stores as the supermarket chain is competing with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl and will have more service and non-food products.
Since Sainsbury's bought Argos and Habitat Chains two years ago, Argos has been sitting in hundreds of stores and has opened a few Habitat stores, which the company claims has boosted grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
A previous attempt to overhaul the supermarket and its pharmacy department failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Fike Boots in the early 2000s but the project was shelved due to conflicts over how profits from the chemist's shop would be shared in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's is adopting the new strategy after selling its 281-store pharmacy business to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, Celesio.
The company said Lloyds would contribute to the plan by adding a luxury range of skincare brands, including La Roche Pose and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed our islands to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in hiring specially trained staff who will be present to advise.
Our brand range is designed to meet all kinds of needs and due to the attractive environment and convenient location we have now become a reliable luxury destination that will challenge the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones is in a fire as Holly Willoughby pulls out of a £11 million deal.
Peter Jones is angry that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled a deal with the lifestyle brand of Dragon's Den star Peter Jones in order to focus on his new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home appliances and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's business has been compared to Ginneth Paltrow's Gup brand.
This morning the 37-year-old news anchor announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute with the aim of focusing on his new bumper deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones became "flamed" in anger when the TV golden girl admitted in an interview at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she had no time for their home goods and accessories brand trolleys due to her new deal worth up to £1.5 million.
The business was compared to Ginneth Paltrow's Gup brand and was expected to double Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
After Willoughby, 37, announced his departure from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on a jet for his holiday home.
A source said: "Trolley has been at the top of Holly's priority list so far.
It was part of his long-term future plans that would have met his financial needs for decades to come.
His decision to withdraw has taken everyone by surprise.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, the project was supposed to be launched soon.
Marlo's headquarters has a warehouse full of products ready for sale".
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is currently one of Britain's most trusted stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds as they have already invested heavily in products ranging from pillows to candles, clothing and household goods, and a possible delay in its launch will add to the loss.
And it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cappe for a decade.
Willoughby started Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I Am A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings".
'Tough conversation and then we fall in love'
He joked that after expressing a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader and making a comment that some people would consider "unpresidential".
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said in his Maquis "news anchor" voice.
"I did not give a concession".
He said Kim was looking forward to meeting for a second time after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting Trump called a huge step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
But the disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "reasonable response" from the United States to its previous disarmament move.
He said the US imposed sanctions as a pressure.
Trump expressed even more optimism during his rally speech.
"We are in good standing with North Korea", he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
It could have killed over a million people.
We have a great relationship now.
He claims his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, which have led to the end of rocket testing, the release of prisoners and the repatriation of remaining American personnel.
And he endorsed her unusual way of talking about her relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be a president, but instead of trying to get in here with 10,000 people outside this crowded arena, there would be only 200 people", Trump pointed to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia: Tsunami and earthquake devastate island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lompoc's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a precondition for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international cooperation, so it is challenging", said Mr. Sambang.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign workers will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether foreign companies would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Despite Indonesia's regular earthquake activity, the country is still miserably unprepared to deal with this natural disaster.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, shelters are also being built in other coastal areas.
Despite the alert, the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even when the weather is fine, traveling to many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make communication more vulnerable.
A ship to Lombok to care for the victims is heading to the hospital in Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the location of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the development of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and has invested heavily in building roads and railways.
But a lack of investment has held back Mr Joko's government ahead of his re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the persistent communal tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 left homeless in the riots between Christians and Muslims, in which two groups fought in the streets with daggers, arrows and other rough weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's beautiful equaliser in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Jordan Shakiri's pass was received 30 yards from the goalpost of Sturgis Chelsea, where his team was 1-0 down.
He first moved the ball to the left and then shot to the post.
The shot goes to the top of the box towards the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed the leaping cappa Arizabalaga and hit the net.
"It's important to get in the right position to catch the ball in time, because players like Shaq always move the ball forward as much as possible, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I see Kante coming forward and I give him a tap and he doesn't think too much".
A Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute of the match, giving Chelsea a 1-0 lead at half-time.
The Blues striker passed Kovacic on the ground, then ran from the midfield into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic went into the midfield with a touchdown.
He then gave a nice ball to Hazard in the box in the Liverpool defensive line.
Hazard lost the defense players by running and scored with a left foot shot into the net from the far post.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will face Vidon in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll has risen to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of the building that was destroyed in the 7.5-magnitude quake, which struck on Friday and caused a 20-foot-high waterfall, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Burkenhead Merseyside this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman found stabbed at 7:55am this morning at Grayson Muse on John Street, has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited the public to report if anyone has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have any footage on the dash cameras, to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman was a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found inside a house.
Friends who thought the woman was familiar arrived at the scene this afternoon and asked where the woman's body was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they are trying to inform the woman's relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Moose tried to enter his apartment when police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to hear about the incident.
Residents are being told it will take several more hours to get inside.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He said it was very sad.
At 2 pm, two police vans were inside the barricade and another outside.
A group of police officers inside the barricade were patrolling the blocks of flats.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC or call 101 or anonymously call CrimeStoppers at 0800 555 11 with the log 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament is another victim of the "history rewriting" controversy.
The statue will be removed after the Taliban's destruction of many cultural and religious monuments in England at the hands of its fanatical followers.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr Crick's suggestion as "nonsense" and an attempt to rewrite history.
"In the current dispute over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target", said Cromwell Society president John Goldsmith.
The iconic iconoclasm or destruction of monuments during the English Civil War was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
The statue of Cromwell will be removed in the next century as a result of the actions of his predecessor Thomas.
The remarkable statue of Cromwell, designed by Sir William Hammock Thornycroft, is a symbol of 19th century opinion and part of a historical character that many people consider worthy of celebration.
"Many people think of Cromwell as the defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the monarchy", Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph.
But whether this is a completely accurate depiction of the period is part of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a familiar figure who represents one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance".
Killer pigs strangled Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found with a torn artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in the Lyupanshui market in southern China's Guizhou province, a report in the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm in Shining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
He came to the market with his brother Fupato from the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs, the report said.
The next morning, her brother Fupaato found her dead and saw that the door to a neighboring pigsty was open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the barn with blood on his face.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked and killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and bruised", said Fupato, whose surname has been identified as Wu, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 am on Thursday.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man is not the man or his brother Fupaato.
A market manager told the Evening News that police were collecting almat at the scene and the pig was being kept in isolation so that it could not attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are discussing how much compensation to pay for his death.
Although rare, pig attacks on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband in Massachusetts were attacked by a pig on their farm, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig held a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife came and scared the pig away.
A farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but can act as "triggers or stimulants" after a farmer in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012.
"They're just being mean.
They bite small, very eager animals... but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to understand them well", he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants will cause heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States.
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, the Rosa will cause heavy rainfall that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5am Eastern Time today, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's supposed to be heading north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a system in the Pacific Ocean has begun to take shape and is moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. Rosa Baja will hit the California peninsula as a monsoon storm on Monday, pushing deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Due to the weather, up to 10 inches of rain will fall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Deep tropical moisture then combined with the system's rushing towards it will create heavy rainfall across the southwest in the coming days.
The rainfall will cause dangerous flash flooding or flash flooding, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert due to 1 to 4 inches of rainfall locally.
Due to deep tropical humidity, rainfall rates can be as high as 2 to 3 inches per hour in various locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The scattered pace of tropical rainfall can cause flash flooding and very rapid deterioration of the situation.
It would be foolish to walk in the desert in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into dangerous rivers and thunderstorms can cause strong winds with dust.
Heavy rainfall is expected locally in parts of the Southern California coastal region due to the current system.
The amount of rainfall can be up to half an inch, which can cause small debris flows on the glittering streets.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainfall is expected in Arizona beginning Sunday night and Monday morning, then it will increase and spread throughout the area from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rainfall will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue till Wednesday.
Several extreme temperature changes may be seen in parts of the US in October as the Arctic cools, but tropical temperatures are still quite warm.
This sometimes results in dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A prime example of this dramatic temperature change was seen in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
The remaining summer heat will try to rise and spread again in the coming days.
The beginning of October is expected to be warm in most of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures reaching as high as 80 degrees in areas from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests that temperatures in the eastern United States are likely to be above average in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanagh's hearing was watched by over 20 million people.
The sensational testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blazy Ford, who were accused of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, was watched by more than 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political wrangling continues, with broadcasters suspending regular programming due to a last-minute surprise on Friday: a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that will give the FBI a week to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that Kavanagh had been drunk at a high school party and tried to pull her clothes off.
Kavanagh said in an emotional testimony that he was 100% sure that the incident did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people mentioned in Nielsen's report watched Friday's activity.
The company was calculating the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, which broadcast the event, were not as readily available for viewership numbers, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people who come to the office.
The audience was the equivalent of the football playoffs or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion show hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, attracted the highest viewership of any network broadcasting the day-long hearing, averaging 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was watched by 3.1 million, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million and CNN by 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
Interest was still low after the hearing.
Flake was the center of today's play.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as he climbed into the elevator to reach the Judiciary Committee hearing and protesters shouted at him.
He stood with his head down for a few minutes in the face of the protestors' shouting, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think Kavanagh is telling the truth to the country?
She was called, "You have power, where many women are helpless".
Flake said his office had made a statement and before the elevator closed, said he had more to say at the committee hearing.
Later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Cavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote, all of the cable and broadcast networks broadcast live.
But Flake said he would vote on the condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats had been requesting.
Flake's acceptance was partially influenced by his conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuhn.
After talking to Kuhn, Flake spoke to several other senators and reached his conclusion.
Flake's decision was a breath of fresh air, as it was clear that the Republicans had no vote to approve Kavanaugh except for the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politics" over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing "political games" over Britain's future and ignoring the nation's interests.
On 29 September 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview printed alongside his front-page interview, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued to criticize May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that Britain and the EU's proposal to collect each other's revenues was "completely absurd".
Police arrested Dayton Simpson, suspect in the death of LSU player Wade Sims.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found in the glasses, CBS affiliate WAFB reported in a report.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to The Advocate, he has been granted bail of $350,000.
The coroner's office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday that stated the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Defendant Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and area residents for assisting in the investigation that resulted in the defendant's arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for its "unrelenting efforts and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "heavily saddened" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"It's a matter of concern all the time", Wade said.
Volcanic ash erupts in Mexico City
The Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern area of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after the volcano's mouth increased in activity and gas and smoke emissions reached 183 on the scale in 24 hours.
The centre was observing multiple thunder and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed ashes falling on car windshields in areas like Joaquimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano's crater, located just 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017 shook Mexico.
The volcano, known as Don Gyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in clashes between police and pro-independence protesters as they joined opposition protesters to celebrate the first anniversary of a vote focused on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists are blocked by police, who throw eggs and paint powder at them, creating a black cloud on the road that is usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, fights broke out which police used batons to stop.
For hours, the liberals chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" as they faced solidarity supporters chanting "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries due to the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been building in the independence-minded region since Madrid declared the October 1 referendum, which was celebrated by separatist Catalans, illegal.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was low because the majority of the anti-secession public boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed in deadly clashes with police last year as they blocked voting during regional elections.
Libertarians were on the streets all night on Friday to block a demonstration against the National Police.
The protesters continued their activities but were forced to take different streets.
Narcis Termis, 68, an electricity worker who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
"Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents tears of joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite a crucial but narrow victory in the provincial elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to keep their momentum going with many of their well-known leaders awaiting voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their organisation's role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, said politicians from both sides had caused the dispute.
He added that the unrest is getting worse by the day.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who remain in pre-trial detention on Saturday, announced late last year that he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to resist the repression and persecution of democratic values by the Spanish government is to stand for the European elections", he said.
London: Man arrested after car collided with house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after being repeatedly hit by a car at a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at 19:30 BST on Thursday in the Balinagar Crescent.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemings says the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, the crossbow was probably aimed at the car.
Menger scored the winning goal in a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly Menger's first goal for Livingston ensures the win.
The promotion stunned Livingston Rangers, who handed Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menger's goal was the difference as Gary Holt's team tied Hibernian with a second goal.
This left Gerrard's side without a single win in the Premiership this season and they will face top-flight Hearts on Sunday, who have an eight-point lead.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, already extending their unbeaten run in the division to six games, has yet to taste the defeat of head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a number of chances against their unarmed opponents.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, as their offensive attitude caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson went through the defense but failed to make his effort pay off, while Alan Lithgow could only run his effort wide after sliding through to meet Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts were letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that the guests could cause trouble on the set.
And that strategy was the key goal.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston opened the scoring. Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set up Menga, who scored from the centre of the box on a touchdown.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the ball but they felt the hosts' defence was vulnerable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly spent most of the time on the bench.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morlos blocked a shot by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was defeated at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and won another set piece for Livingston from Lithgow Wide.
Crosses were constantly coming into the Livingston box and were also constantly getting cleared, although two penalty claims - one to alternate Glenn Middleton after Hallett's challenge and one for handball - were dismissed.
The incredible 'Kirti Livingston' is analyzed.
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony McCarney Arena
A remarkable performance and result for Livingston.
For one person, they were great, continuing to exceed everyone's expectations in their upward pace.
Their style of play and players have changed little since their return to the top flight, but the credit goes to Holt for the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was extraordinary, built a superbly organized defense, and kept the manga's Connor Goldson and Joe Warhol neutral at all times.
The Rangers were under-motivated, though.
They're not as good as they used to be under Gerard.
They lacked the final ball - only once they opened the reception - and that's a warning to the Rangers, who are now at the mid-table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
The situation was very cheerful as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin on Saturday for Brexit.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a massive new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police set up security to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but large numbers of supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - were heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and his decision to welcome him to Germany.
This conflict demonstration is proof that a visitor is hailed as a hero by German Turks and denounced as a tyrant by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist has been killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened at around 10am local time (0010 GMT) near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and the cyclist was given first aid, but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened months after another bicycle accident on Childers Street, which is located about a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
The road has been blocked and bus barriers have been placed and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot.
Six prison officers were injured in the chaos at the high security men's prison, the prison office said.
At around 9.30am on Sunday, chaos broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the chaos, including eight prisoners belonging to a branch.
Officers were treated at the scene for facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lawn.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the guilty will be brought to justice and will spend longer time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartine houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator had been hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, Wright officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot where workers were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City. (Although drought-prone areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressure is rare to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what looks like early next week as Hurricane Rosa will sweep through the southwestern desert with its remaining strength, with the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, in western Arizona, for Monday and Tuesday.
The roost is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive with rain later on Monday.
Phoenix's National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967), which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ boundary. "
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches on the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive roughly 1 to 2 inches of rain, with sporadic amounts of up to 4 inches.
Fasting rain can be a blessing for people outside the flood risk zone as the areas are drought-prone.
Although the flooding is a serious concern, the rainfall is likely to be of some benefit as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, according to Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path will cause landslides across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a powerful hurricane, with a maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is moving 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles per hour north.
The storm is strengthening as it faces cold waters in the Pacific Ocean.
So, Monday afternoon or evening, the force of the tropical storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico.
Heavy rainfall is expected across Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Up to 10 inches of rain is likely in northwestern Sonora from Baja California".
Rosa will then travel northward across Mexico as a tropical low before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning and it will enter southern Utah through Arizona on Tuesday night.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rainfall could cause deadly flash floods and destructive currents in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four attempted murderers arrested.
A man in his 20s and three teenagers have been arrested in Somerset for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 4am on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is now in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Redstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers are asking anyone who may have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was a victim of the Democratic Party's "cruelty, rage".
"A vote in favor of Judge Cavanagh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was a victim of the Democratic Party's "cruelty, rage" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanagh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she was sexually abused by her hands decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the extraordinaryness and the qualities and the courage of Kavanaugh that day".
Addressing West Virginia supporters, he said a vote for Jazz Kavanaugh would be a vote to protect the most successful legal figure of our time, a lawyer with a sterling record of public service".
While speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the president vaguely acknowledged Kavanaugh's nomination.
"We are just five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I am not participating, but I am participating", he said.
"That's why I always strive to fight for the great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "prevent and deter".
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is not expected until after Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Indonesia is witnessing a rise in the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami.
At least 384 people have been killed and many more washed up in the sea as a massive earthquake and tsunami washed up on the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered on a beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a festival when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave broke on the beach in the evening, driving many people to their deaths and destroying everything along the way".
The tsunami follows a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"Yesterday, even when the tsunami threat was present, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and those who could not immediately run away and become victims", Indonesian disaster mitigation agency BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it took away cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Nguroho, adding that the tsunami travelled at 800 km/h (497 mph) in the open sea before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived.
Around 16,700 people have been evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Sky-based images released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, and a mosque submerged.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the capacity of the World War II atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, can increase the size of tsunamis.
Nguroho described the damage as "extensive" with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels destroyed.
Some bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
According to Nugroho, the casualties and damage could be higher in Dangala, an area along the coastline 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu near the epicenter.
The communications system was "completely paralyzed with no information", said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were moving to the affected area.
"It's already a tragedy but it could be worse.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not providing information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the same time as the warning was issued.
Raw footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of the building yelling tsunami warnings to people in the street below.
Within minutes, a massive stream of water slammed into the shore and washed away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that cut off communications around the platform and made rescue efforts difficult for authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo planes to Jakarta and other cities to help, authorities said, with rescuers now in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palo shelters on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really terrible.
According to Mr. Doseba, as the World Organization's staff were making their way safely from Dongala to the city of Palu, where the staff were taking shelter in their office courtyards, they saw images of destruction along the way.
Doseba added that they saw many houses destroyed.
It's a sad thing.
Even when relief teams started disaster relief operations, some complained that skilled foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, food supplies and personnel can only come when a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
But it hasn't been announced yet.
Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: "This is still a provincial-level disaster".
Once the government says yes, it is a national disaster, we can start international aid but we have not yet received any such announcement.
On the second night of the tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and family of the missing are hoping for a miracle that will bring hope to find them after a brutal chapter of the natural disaster.
A little boy was pulled from the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been lying on a rock for two days next to her mother's body.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Jendon Subandono trained two paragliders from the Asian Games, who are now missing, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mendagi also pointed out that the people trapped at the Roya Roya Hotel were his students.
He added that as a pioneer in the field of paragliding, he is responsible for his own emotions.
Mr. Gendon recalled how news of the Roya Roya Hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community hours later, and he was baffled to spread it via WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who were attending a festival on the beach.
Although his message was unread instead of being read.
He said, "That means the message was not sent".
Thieves stole $26,750 while refilling the ATM in Newport, Liv.
A Newport Police Department press release said the thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning while staff at the Bronx ATM were putting money in.
The driver was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy told a news conference.
While he was working, another Bronx employee ran after him and escaped with a bag full of money that was ready to be handed over.
According to a press release, witnesses saw many suspects flee, but police have not yet confirmed the number of people involved.
Anyone who can identify these individuals is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
This rapper changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kane West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change, he tweeted on Saturday: "Officially known as Kane West".
West, 41, was also known as Ye for some time and used the name as his nickname.
The name change was revealed ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she was expected to unveil her new album Yandy.
The show's producer says he is replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word has religious connotations for him, as well as being a shortened form of his current professional name.
West said earlier this year when discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy, "I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you.'"
So I am you, I am us, this is us.
What Cain is saying is that the only person, the Ye, reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is more about who we are".
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is variously known as Puff Daddy, PDD or DD, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brothers Love.
A former associate of West's, Jay-Z, he worked with hyphen, without hyphen and capital.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez has vowed to stop the use of military force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the bloody atrocities against students.
Lopez Abrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "we will not use military force to oppress the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration that killed 300 people as the leftist student movement in Latin America was building its stronghold.
Lopez Abrador apologizes to young Mexicans by offering monthly tuition and helping to build more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting youngsters to crime syndicates.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Li, an artificial intelligence researcher and investor who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The quote comes from various parts of the government, in the United States, declaring that the United States has a formal strategic deficit in artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, launched its new plan last year: to become the number one AI innovator by 2030.
Li added that doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start where most countries are far behind in this area and we are looking for the next step to advance in AI.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the US acquiring the next big AI, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month, is the CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a Sinovation Venture that invested in Face++, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat out the highest-ranked American player, and by the fall he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged previous US government technology challenges such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge to determine the next step.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee says.
"China is not removing academic leaders; corporations are", Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired intellectuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help further boost the US' AI efforts.
"I think the green card should be automatically offered to PhDs in artificial intelligence", he said.
China's State Council released its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, as well as spending money on US researchers, but academic work in China has a low standard, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which means engaging industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DRPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As NSF, it currently invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no progress in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece that blocked its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed NATO and EU accession.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition believes the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and doubts that the turnout required to reach the minimum 50 percent required for the boycott campaign referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, including the recognition of the treaty with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued for the price Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia, would have to pay for its admission to the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely in the shadow of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us", said Oliveira Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
While not legally binding, sufficient members of parliament have said they will abide by the results of the vote by making decisions.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said that as of 1 pm there were no reports of irregularities.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the 2016 national parliamentary elections, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, we have a place in Europe", said Jose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in favor of the country's name change in a referendum in Macedonia, which will pave the way for Macedonia's accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and pulling chairs in front of tents set up for those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the service doors", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian solidarity".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said a "yes" result would be our "future guarantee".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, below the voting threshold required for a turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
The referendum needs more than 50% of the vote to be successful.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero moves into the full Brighton defence for a goal
Brighton defence were eliminated by Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it easy to see his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before going out into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned a defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he threw a left-handed pass, which found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to shoot to the right of the net, defeating Brighton defender Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his legs", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment".
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage of fighting for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He passed the ball to Leroy Sen with a nice pass on the left side of the end.
Sen took a few touches before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before it crossed the line.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rheine Necker Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in the Spoiler vs. Rockies game.
There was little reason to force another start after the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer is hoping to take the mound against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the playoffs have an impact on the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies earned at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to win their first division title.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can get a foot in the door with the Denver crowd knowing that the ABA and the other team will probably play at the highest level of whatever point I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are rumored to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch at his usual rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the president sharply cited the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running so I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they are determined to restore power by any means necessary, you see this lowliness, this cruelty.
They don't care who they hit, who they have to crush to gain power and control, they just want power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
He said the Democrats are on a mission to "prevent and deter".
"And you've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and nasty and untrustworthy".
He named Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which received loud scolding from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Oh, what.
No, oh no, I'll wait -- that was really bad body language.
Labour is no longer a free association.
People who say what they mean are not tolerated here.
It was no surprise when the Momentum Party workers in my area voted me in.
I was the last Labour MP on the list to say that your free speech will not be welcome here.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was convicted of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on Europe and national security and similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with even previous leaders.
"We want to make the meetings inclusive and productive", the notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting said.
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, this is the first time a GC meeting on a Friday night has been like this.
But sadly, today, that is not the tone of that meeting and the promise of "kind, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever really began.
It has become increasingly apparent that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started as soon as Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political views began to expect me to take a U-turn and take a position I would not agree to under any circumstances - be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly  and even though it doesn't matter what I say - I get smeared on social media, called out for my removal, condemned for the politics of the Centre, and told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a storm of gender discrimination or racist abuse every day but never feel ashamed.
The most frustrating aspect of this era of politics is how the rampant bullying has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a liberal organization and every "non-voting" or change in election rules narrows the party.
For the past two years, I've had a lot of people tell me to keep my head down, not be so loud, and I'll be okay.
But I didn't come to politics to do that.
When I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, spurred on by the Thatcher government's negligence that literally destroyed our sprawling school classrooms, I then tried to provide the necessary government services to those who needed them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been in any way misled about my policy stance and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the movement on Friday, I will only say that I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services.
But really it's not a message to me for Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of a lockdown or political activism will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP for Nottingham East.
Melrose: Rise to the top of undefeated earnings
Two late attempts may narrow the final result gap somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayer deserved to win the day's extraordinary entertainment tenant's premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top 10.
In the end, it was their best defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that helped the hosts win and was a valid reason for coach Peter Murchie to be happy.
"We have been tested in every game so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy".
"Credit goes to Ayre, they have exploited their potential better than we have", says Melrose's Robin Christie.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, however, a yellow card from Scottish player Rory Hughes, which sent him out for the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the majority and Jason Baggott an unsuccessful try.
Klimo scored a penalty to increase Ayre's lead, just before, during halftime, he scored a single attempt to make it 17-5 at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's effort, converted by Baggott, cut the gap to five points.
The game was then suspended for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruairidh Knot, who was stretchered and when play resumed, Ayur went much further with the effort of Stafford McDowall, who converted Clemmo.
Ayer's incumbent captain Blair McPherson was then given a yellow card and after a spell of deadly pressure again, Melrose's Bruce Colvin tried to penalise Ayer's extra player.
Although the hosts came back just fine, and when Stroud Hutchinson saw a yellow card to face Klimos without the ball, McPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line to advance the revenue pile.
Once again Clem converting, Kyle Rowe when he bagged a box kick from David Armstrong and sent out flanker Gregor Henry on the fifth try of the home side.
Steel Game star ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Steel Game star Ford Kieran says he is ready to enter the hospitality industry after being named the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote himself and co-starred in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Both have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's last, and it appears Keiran is planning her own after Craigellaung.
According to the list of official records, he is the director of Adriftmoron Ltd.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although Scottish Sun sources indicated that Keiran is looking to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court reopens way to Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a rigging clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right".
It's a responsibility to restore it".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of losing to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still vivid, as is the desire to sail once more to the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that momentum, unity and calm spirit and of course we look forward to the outcome with a positive attitude", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will uphold Bolivia's claim that - after decades of proper negotiation - Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who will face a contentious re-election battle next year - also has much to rely on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and even if it does, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to grant territory to Chile and said it would not determine the outcome of any potential negotiations.
The ICJ ruling, which comes just six months after the final argument was heard, indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Garrete, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of moving the Bolivian cause forward, it may have gone backwards in the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", said Jarrett.
Morales' anti-war speech has upset any over-reliance on Chilean wishes, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk for a while, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodriguez Velázquez, denied that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political pole.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past".
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not come until it trusts the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation would not disarm first if it could not trust Washington.
He was addressing the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honor the pledge made during a summit of rival leaders in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on track to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un after more than three months in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and US objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would incline North Korea.
Washington is wary that Pyongyang may agree to the declaration without first going through a significant disarmament process.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are widespread doubts that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country sees as probably the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo wants to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant headwear on the way to a high street near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or block the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a line of oversized head gear for their SS19 collection at the runway that stunned the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the most absurd hats have been ripping off Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to Catwalk.
One of Valentino's creations was an over-the-top beige hat decorated with a feather-like broad stem that covered the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories include ornamental watermelons, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Brown also released a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lip sewing and a more Hannibal-like look than the gruesome humor.
One creation resembles full scuba diving gear with snorkel and goggles, the other looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep making the big fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Style observers predict that giant bonnets could be heading to the high street near you.
The outsized hats compete with La Bomba, a two-foot wide straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski has been seen wearing.
Behind the highly unfashionable hat that has been scattered across social media, the cult label has sent Catwalk another big creation - a straw beach bag that is almost as big as a swimsuit model.
The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and with a white leather handle on top, was one of the items in Jacimas' La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FemMail: 'I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the high street next summer - with designers having such a big impact, the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continues with another outstanding test result in 2018, only strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen professions and their place as global citizens.
As an educational field that a particular school can design and implement curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and the subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart".
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of the most recent tests this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates among individual schools.
A total of 68% of foreign language students achieved A-levels.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved A-levels in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now, as a subject choice, being held in the same way as the curriculum of independent schools and STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey found that 17 percent of the reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies were attributed to their lack of language skills.
So more and more, language skills are becoming essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world for more potential job opportunities that require language.
Whatever career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future as they acquire life-long skills.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
In a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were not fluent in a foreign language when conversing, and French was the only language spoken by the ten-percent, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today's children to invest in language education.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while looking ahead to 2020 will see others teaching languages considered most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in individual schools, including language-specific teaching staff.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in the future, no matter what.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied at this time that languages play a vital role for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will provide this choice, diversity and encouragement for young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need precision games to be ready at this stage of my career", he said.
During Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump storms a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies for Trump next week, with stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With confirmation votes pending for his election to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how are you watching online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to address the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hearing this week, which has been heated by allegations of sexual misconduct during an FBI investigation with an expected Senate confirmation vote.
But the primary goal of opening these rallies is to help Republicans gain some momentum ahead of the November election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign says the five rallies next week are aimed at "strengthening volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and House of Representatives", Reuters reports.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that as we enter the busy campaign season the president will travel to as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Scheduled for the Wesbenko Arena in Wheeling, today's rally "could bring in supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia since last month, a state he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the polls, ahead of the election.
"It's not a good sign for Mr. Morrissey that the president should try to push him further into the election", said West Virginia University politician Simon Heather, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows its hunger to keep hope alive in Sunday's singles
The Ryder Cup was needed for Saturday afternoon's forums after three one-sided sessions.
The pendulum swing of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but it's what the players really believe in, and most of all in this kind of competition.
So where's Momentum now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little bit of momentum now", Jordan Speith said walking away for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points to go with 12 games to play.
As Speith said, the Americans feel they have some help along the way and they can be encouraged by a lot, especially the form of Speeth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and they both have four points to three.
Speeth was lethal from start to finish and is leading from the front.
The loud shouts of celebration grew louder as his round progressed, when he and Thomas made a crucial pass to win the entire four-point square match despite being two points behind after scoring two.
His leg that won the game in the 15th got the same scream, which tells you a lot that he believes the American team is not out of it.
"You have to really go deep and think about your match", Speith said.
Every one of these players has it now.
18 holes to make a mark.
Only Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup's unquestioned story, have scored more points in the last two days than Speith and Thomas.
The strange but adorable couple from Europe is four to four and can't make any mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who did not shoot a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided the bogie on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at the back nine.
That run, and the way their energy was flowing in and out of this enthusiastic crowd, made it look like they were the losing players on Sunday, and as the sun set on Le Golf National, there were no other potentially popular players to seal the European victory but Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's better if they're both in different holes at the same time.
Although the European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson had some problems for Sergio Garcia, the morning foosball hero, while paired with Alex Naren.
The first nine had a bogey and two double Spaniards and a Swede thrown into a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to pull you out of your hole.
It is very interesting to watch the interaction between the pair, the suggestions they make, the ones they don't make, and the strategy that can change instantly.
Europe has played relatively well as a team so far and has taken a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session further demonstrated that Team USA has a hunger for battle that some, especially the Stateside, had doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will take a healthy advantage with a 10-6 lead over the United States from Saturday's Foursome and Foursome matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The cheerful pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari now lead their draw at the Golf National by four points with two wins over the two-time defending champion Tiger Woods.
Thomas Jorn's European side, bidding to recover the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, won the series 3-1 by beating the flawed American side in the morning foursomes.
The USA won two games and offered more resistance to the Forums, but they could not fill the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to reclaim the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to score four points in a row and he and Molinari, together with Malliwood, are only the second pair to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history after an extraordinary weekend.
They then superbly jailed Woods and Patrick Reed to beat a losing Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambeau even more forcefully by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself out of two games on Saturday, has occasionally taken a brilliant storm but now he has lost 19 of his 29 games in Foursquare and Foursquare and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning foursome, returns to forums partner Henrik Stenson in a 2-1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepker - world number one and number three.
A lovely, windy day in the southwest of Paris, although Europe was not on its own.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a strong 2-1 victory over Spain's John Ram and Ian Polter at the Fourball and came back by beating Polter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 on the opening two holes at the Foursome.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit in the singles, although as of now only a draw is needed to restore the trophy to the Furik side.
After being second best for two days, however, Sunday's counterattack looks set to overtake them.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without 'trust in any way'.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that existing sanctions were deepening mistrust of the United States and that the country had no chance of unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant positive steps" last year, such as committing to halt nuclear and missile tests, dismantle the nuclear laboratory, and not to further nuclear technology and nuclear weapons proliferation.
"But we have not seen a similar response in the US", he said.
"If we have no confidence in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security and there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm in such a situation".
While Ri described North Korea's accusations against Washington's "decentralized" approach to nuclear disarmament that it would be rewarded for taking slow action, his remarks seemed significant because he did not completely discount unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on "the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and when Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"America has insisted on 'disarmament-first' and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their objectives with the mandate, even as they object to 'declarations of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can tip us to the ground is a nightmare for those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust".
Ri did not comment on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president had outlined at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, saying: "The disarmament issue would not have stalled if it had not been for the United States and South Korea".
Still, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable while "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a suicidal "rocket man".
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months to do it - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the action taken by the UN Security Council
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Americans at the Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council sanctions must continue in effect until we fully realize the ultimately verified disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the UN General Assembly Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second conference.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He said when he left Pyongyang in July that some progress had been made, only hours before North Korea denounced him for "claiming like a thug!"
North Korea promised to demolish a missile site and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States "takes similar measures".
He said the "relevant steps" Kim told him he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore and was moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is showing all its graduates how to get more sleep to combat the growing culture of caffeine-fueled "night owls" who study late.
An educator has discovered that students at the world's number one university are often confused about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Siziler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on how sleep deprivation impacted education.
And at the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why did you tell me this all along, coming to my senior year?'
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
Launched for the first time this year, the course explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic performance as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Department of Health Care, said the university decided to launch the course after students were severely sleep deprived this week.
The one-hour course consists of several consecutive related tasks.
One section features images of a dormitory room, where students click on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and to realize the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
'We know it won't immediately change students' behaviour.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking if you decide to smoke", adds Professor Sizilar.
He said that the culture of 'pride of staying up all night' still exists, adding that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students.
Ensuring you get enough good quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even sleep deprivation starves the brain, leaving them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old studying chemical and physical biology in California who helped Professor Sizzler design the course, also took a class during his freshman year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him for a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes to ask all postgraduate students to complete such a study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cizilar recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electric screens and LED lights, which can destroy your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston Rangers 1-0: Manger defeated the Shiites by a goal from Gerard.
The Rangers suffered another away defeat as Steven Gerrard's random team lost 1-0 to Livingston on a Dolly Menger goal.
The Ibrox side were looking to win another after a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side handed Gerrard his second defeat as manager in 18 games, which put him eight points clear of Ladbrokes' Premiership-topping Hearts.
Manga hit seven minutes before halftime but the disappointed Rangers lineup never gave them a knock.
Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston are up to third and behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And it could be a bigger problem for the Rangers as lineman Calum Spence has been treated for head injuries from an object thrown from the side of the road.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that took Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi's 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and should be proud of the way his well-equipped team suffocated the opponent.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did more with their ball.
Menger sent Scott Pittman to the goal on the first lay-off of Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed his big chance.
Keegan got a long free-kick from Jacobs' captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to hit the ball at the back post.
The Rangers regained control but in the final third they had more than their game confidence.
Alfredo Morlos certainly felt that he should have received his penalty in the quarter-hour due to the collision between him and Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers could only target two shots on goal in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly Lasana was slightly hampered by a head by Kulibli and shots by Ov Azaria.
Levy's opening 34th-minute goal may have been against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that they are the only ones who deserve this design game.
Once again the Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' deep set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not respond due to Deacon Gallagher's ball being slotted by Scott Robinson, who kept his head cool for choosing the manga for the normal finish.
Gerard took action at half-time to replace Ryan Kent for Culibaly and the replacement was to go into effect almost immediately as the winger was in Morals, but the remarkable Kelly moved him off the line to block.
However, Livingston fans started playing exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halcott sending long balls after long balls.
Holt's team could have extended their lead into the final stage, but McGregor was able to stop Jacobs' effort before he headed out of Lithgow corner.
With Jacobs stumbling, Thompson again turned down the Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton's demand for a late penalty.
The inventor of the Geiger counter.
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gaiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually became known as the Gaiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter also became a staple of pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring seemingly up-and-coming cowpock scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Gauger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can hear the effects of atoms given off by radioactivity in minerals".
"That's a lot of noise, isn't it?"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday
But his invention still lives.
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to recognize and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the lab.
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then be reintroduced.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results with patients with various degrees of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves harvesting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they "look" at a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinserting the cells.
"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor Jay Burzfsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "causes the growth of a variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer", explains Professor Barzhowski.
Extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to "target" cancer cells has worked similarly to treat leukemia.
Kanye West is embroiled in a pro-Trump debate on SNL wearing a MAGA hat
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed into the studio after a rousing performance during Saturday Night Live where he praised US President Donald Trump for keeping his dream alive in 2020.
After performing her third song of the night, Ghost Town, where she wore a Make America Great cap, she denounced Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"A lot of times when I talk to a white person, they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist!'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanagh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault claims by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's satire was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if the Rock was trying to mock West with the post, though.
In addition, West complained to the audience that she had to face problems backstage with her headwear.
"They were yelling at me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat on".
They insulted me!
And then they said I was in a sinking place", according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "Do you want to see the place?" saying that he will read his "Superman Cap", because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Then try it with love".
His comments were booed at least twice from the audience and embarrassed SNL cast members, Variety reported, with one person telling the publication: "There was a pinfall of silence throughout the studio".
West was brought in as an alternative to singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by dressing up like a Peria bottle during the performance of I Love It.
West has received support from Candace Turner, head of conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up to the bad guys".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is what he was and he's absolutely great".
"But I choose not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their" art ") who is embracing and spreading ideals that are harmful to my community.
He is free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "officially known as Kanye West".
D is not the first artist to change his name and D.D., who is known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P.D.D. has followed his path.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Leon and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to an icon who was previously known as Prince.
A suspect has been charged with attempted murder in a stabbing in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
Police said the incident happened in Balihakamore.
The accused is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington has attacked toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is known for his warrior role as Jon Snow in HBO's offensive medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor said that playing such a role on screen means giving young boys the idea that they have to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something has gone wrong' and questioned how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at the age of 31, admits that he feels overwhelmed by the issue.
'I personally, feel quite strongly, right now - where are we going wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What did we teach the men growing up that we are now facing this problem?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its hyper-masculine characters.
He added: 'What is simple and what are we learning?
What is it that is taught on TV and in the streets that boys feel that this is the path they must follow to become men?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because obviously the young people have made some big mistakes.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be doing a Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series is renewed next summer, saying that he has 'finished the battlefield and the horse life'.
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, a story about a film producer and his thieving brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his wife Rose the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the show, so it's my future family that gave me my life.
Rose starred as the lover of Kit's character, John Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Egret.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of HIV and AIDS cases.
There are more than 820,000 cases in the country, health officials said.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were due to sexually transmitted infections, which is different from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly to parts of China due to blood circulation.
But the number of people infected with HIV has been brought down to almost zero along the way, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still seen as widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry women later.
Many disease infections come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaks, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories' by GOP senators
US Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that these claims were being promoted by "ultra-right wing" scholars and websites.
"Lies, lies and more hateful lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Scholar and RedStat reported that the post's source-identifying IP address was associated with the "Water" office and disclosed information about any member of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is a complete lie and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by this fraud and false allegations - were in no way responsible for the leak.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This denial is outrageous", wrote Fleischer.
"It shows that he has no inclination to be a Congressman.
They don't get angry when someone is accused of something they didn't do.
They certainly won't argue.
They should not question the complainant's motives.
They must be calm and quiet".
Fleisher was comparing Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics found very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's big if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies to the fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits are exposed", he continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again - The Spy with the Bad Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to see Brexit in any new film with British curves, and this seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the self-deprecating fact of how obviously trash we are become a new export opportunity?
At any rate, pop-eyed, rubber-faced cripple Johnny English has a license to create new things for the second time - more than anything else his name implies he is a wide-ranging comic creation designed for the cinema world of languages other than English.
He is certainly a foolproof secret agent who is somewhat bound up despite his quirky tendency to smooth glitz, a dash of Mr. Bean and a dolp of chaps contributing a note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He was primarily based on the Traveler and starred in the once-forgotten Barclays TV commercials of international mystery man Atkinson, spreading chaos in the consciousness.
There are one or two great moments in this latest Jay-Out.
I loved watching Johnny English approach a helicopter with rotor blades hanging from a small helmet in medieval armor.
Atkinson's gift for physical humor is showing, but the humor has been perceived as quite low-quality and oddly over-the-top, especially since "Serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offer comedy as an element.
The joke seems to be aimed more at children than adults, and to me Johnny English's bizarre accidents are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent-film joke on Bean.
The topical premise for many years is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the top-secret web network of British espionage, revealing the identities of all the British agents in the field, to frustrate the agent in charge - a small role, tragically for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last hope for a prime minister who is already suffering from a complete political slump, a mischievous and bound personality: Emma Thompson does her best with this semi-Theresa-May character but there's not much to work with on the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every active spy had been compromised, so he had to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means babbling to Johnny English, who is now employed as a schoolteacher at some high-end institution, but teaches off the record about how to be an undercover worker: Here's some good jokes, since English here offers a rock-type school of detective academy.
English returns to the White House for an emergency briefing and is once again reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick boyfriend, played by Ben Miller.
Baugh is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a Jolly-Hockey-Stick role in which Vicky Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who made a fatal mistake in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and face off against Olga Kurelenko's whore Ofelia Bullitova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacy.
English and Beau start their far-reaching high-zinc strange noise: they set fire to a flash French restaurant under the guise of a waiter; they push Voltaire onto a luxury boat and start a brawl by smuggling themselves; and English creates a sheer chaos by trying to use Voltaire's virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of his house.
All stops are drawn for the last sequence, of course, but as illusory and entertaining as it is, the whole thing has quite a bit of a children's TV feel to it.
It's a pretty mediocre staff.
And like many other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly did justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is making plans for Britain to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a master plan that would see Britons work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The team reportedly wants company owners to share the money saved by employees with an extra day off through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
It will see employees enjoy three days off - but still take home the same salary.
The idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and the plan to move the country in favour of workers, the source said.
The Trades Union Congress has authorized the shift of workers to a four-day week as a way to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but a four-day workday is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach to balance the economy for the workers as well as the whole industrial team.'
Labour, not the first to support such an idea, the Green Party pledged four-day workdays during their 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole, though.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day workday is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to articulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to turn power back from 'unknown managers' and 'beneficiaries' to utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plan means that current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back as the Labour government may 'give up' some of it due to perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to keep employees on company boards and create an inclusive ownership fund to justify 10% of employees of private sector companies, with annual dividends of $500.
Lindsey Graham, tell John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh will change their mind.
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the bureau's investigations have raised questions about whether any Republican senator can turn their support away.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I asked to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, the complaint came out, I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unwavering".
Graham's vote, of course, seems to be irrevocable.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanagh and a big, pretty big complaint would be needed to change that", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denies it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And they couldn't verify whose name he was talking about.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any change".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a great line-up of star performers and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people rolling out onto the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes not only to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival described in 2012 is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group hoping to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of actively struggling people who actively advocate internationally.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform multiple tasks or "activities" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen in achieving its goals in the 12 years to come?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real step to persuade people to call for action, or is it another case of so-called "clictivism" - where people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving toward achieving various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce more than $37 billion worth of commitments and policies that will impact the lives of 2.2 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and declarations that have been made since its inception, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or funded.
The team estimates that the secured funds have so far directly impacted around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history", Tracy Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 initiatives in the United States to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
One of the most frequently asked questions asked on its website is "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Moné are among those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy to "block" Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington could resort to its navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian fuel from reaching Middle Eastern countries, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to a description from the Washington Examiner.
Gink claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that their position in the Middle East is because they want to broker power like Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe", he said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, along with our Navy, has the ability to keep the seaway open and blockade if necessary to ensure that their fuel does not reach the market", he said.
Zinkke was speaking to attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that identifies itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He was comparing Washington's treatment of Russia and Iran, saying they are the same in real life.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are to benefit from and replace less and less energy", he said, noting the "task of holding Russia in the palm of your hand" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The comments come as the Trump administration aims to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe at a much cheaper price for European customers instead of Russia.
Under its influence, US President Donald Trump himself, along with officials from the Trump administration, is trying to draw Germany out of the "appropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is held in Berlin by Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters - is a completely economically viable project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing but financial and is an example of unequal competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that customers should have the ability to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after an interview with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has been met with a negative reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's industry leader, has called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"We have a major problem with third-party interference in our energy supply", said Dieter Kamph, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "look over her shoulder" in the 2020 presidential race, says Massachusetts senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday she would "look into" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he is in the race at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes putting women in top positions", she said, The Hill reports.
"After November 6th, I will strongly decline to run for president".
Warren Town Hall during the campaign criticized President Donald Trump, saying Trump was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has faced criticism from Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote", Warren tweeted on Friday.
A poll released on Thursday found that most of Warren's own voters do not think he should run in 2020.
A Suffolk University Center for Political Research/Boston Globe poll found that "probable" fifty percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the fight.
The poll found support for former Governor Deval Patrick to contest the election was higher, with 38 percent supporting a potential fight and 48 percent not.
Other high-profile Democratic names likely to be discussed in the 2020 election campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reports that Biden said he will make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes Trump's PTSD at a rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"I understand the other families who understand PTSD and the consequences of some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with", he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little changed, they come back stronger, they come back wondering if what they have given to the country, the army and the air force and other members of the military, they have respect for their colleagues".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and, according to police department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence, weapons possession and drug possession on a woman.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
To support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in court in Washington on Friday, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not released.
He said he was abused by his associates "and his violent gang members boys", but US officials denied his asylum application on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Attorneys from states supporting Grace cite El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as examples, as countries that are largely plagued by gangs and domestic violence, from which large numbers of asylum seekers come to the United States.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The Friend-of-the-Court brief states that "this federal law requires that all refugee applications be judged on specific facts and circumstances and that such a ban violates the original intent".
The attorneys further argue in the statement that the policy of denying immigrants entry is hurting the US economy, because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and they "provide essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer shelter victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum can be given to those who have had to leave their country due to persecution or fear of persecution due to membership in a particular social group or political opinion, race, religion, nationality or other", Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Refuge has never been meant to be a solution to all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll has doubled amid efforts to save the survivors and desperate rescue efforts in Palu.
The situation was dire for the survivors.
"It was very disturbing", said Reesa Kusuma, 35, at a shelter in the city of Palu to comfort her feverish child.
Ambulance arrives every minute with a body.
Clean water is not available.
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes as they search for what they can find in the water.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were flooded with victims of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who suffered broken back and shoulder bones, were taken outside the Palo Army Hospital, where they were treated under the sky as a result of the strong aftershock.
He cried when he told of the tremors of the terrible earthquake while staying in a five-story hotel room with his wife and daughter.
I didn't have time to save myself.
I was trapped between the broken walls, I think", Harris told the press that they were in town for a wedding.
I hear my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my kids.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of "propaganda advertising" and "defamation"
A week after a state-run Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the US daily citing mutual benefits of US-China trade, China's US ambassador has accused Beijing of using the US press to conduct a targeted campaign against it.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to a paid supplement in Iowa's largest Chinese daily, Des Moines Register, on Wednesday, accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election was described by US officials as a new effort by Washington to pressure China.
It is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a trade war that has led to them increasing tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and US experts say China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Branstad wrote in the Sunday newspaper Des Mines Register that China "has now doubled that brutality with targeted advertising in our own free press".
"The Chinese government is taking unethical advantage of America's cherished history of free speech and free press in its propaganda campaign with paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will find limited opposition voices at newsstands along the streets of Beijing and you will not see a true reflection of the disagreements that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic path, because the media here is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that his article was "refused to be published by a major Chinese newspaper", though he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are trying to keep women voters out of the midterm debate on Kavanaugh, analysts warn.
As many top Republicans have sided with and covered up for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have warned they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment around the issue has grown dramatically and it appears that most Republicans are already openly voting to move forward.
"There is no way they can go back", Grant Rihar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Riar said there are doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) 's last-minute push for an FBI investigation will calm angry voters.
According to the Washington DC newspaper, Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the progressive Movement group and national women's spokesperson, said on Friday that "women don't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow and November".
Protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a protest in the Senate hallway on Friday morning as Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, Mike said.
"Democratic incentives and motivation will be a thing of the past", said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
People say there's too much already; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among the suburban women voters and young voters aged 18 to 29 who don't often vote because they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony on allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there could be a backlash from Republicans if he went ahead with the endorsement.
"This has become a complicated issue for the GOP", former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele told NBC News earlier last week.
It's not just about whether the committee vote or the final vote or the caff will be behind it, but how the Republicans have handled it and how they have handled it, Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA Group, which supports Democrats in the vote, told the news channel.
However, in the wake of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony, Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe, with opinions heavily biased towards the latter.
A new survey by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, with 35 percent saying they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
It also found that 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied during his testimony, compared with only 30 percent who said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before a judicial committee last week that he was molested by Kavanaugh while drunk at age 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party while she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inraput, is a company that will build the open source platform Solid from Berners-Lee.
Solid gives users the right to choose where their data is stored and what information humans are allowed access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inraptor's real goal is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-ups.
This is a historic moment.
The app allows anyone to create a P&D or "personal online data store" using Solid's technology.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in the same browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about personal online data stores is that it's entirely up to the user - who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "Data-driven Personal Empowerment".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, Inraptor's idea is to help bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to ensure solid power for all.
The company is currently a security platform acquired by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, and consists of a team of contracted on-staff developers and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools already available on the Inrapport website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are "not talking about whether to launch a complete revolution with Facebook and Google where their entire business model is completely changed overnight".
We don't ask them for permission.
In a post on the site published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inraptor's "purpose is to provide commercial fuel and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even at the launch of Inrapport, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this coming era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: World War I Victoria Cross Clerical celebration was held in the town of Vlissingen, near the town of Vlissingen.
The centenary of the original town was celebrated by the only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Van won the award during the attack on Bellingly and Lehankott on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by an assassin four days later and never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled his memorial at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely significant" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van Zant led his battalion through thick fog and heavy field and machine gun fire during the passage of the Canal de Saint-Quentin.
He then ran to the firing line and led the line with "great courage" with only a field song and shot three enemies.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German assassin on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, says his grandfather's work is "something I could never do and that I have great respect for".
He and his brother Dr. James Van laid flowers after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the support of so many people is showing the heroism of a true hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch 206 Belotot, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night watching a great Bellator 206 and the main event isn't being shown.
The original bill card from San Jose featured 13 fights, including six, and was shown live all night on Channel 5 in the UK.
In the early hours of the morning, as Gagard Moussaci and Rory McDonald prepared to face each other, the coverage changed to Peppa Pig to the shock of UK viewers.
Especially because of this fight, they stayed up until dawn, so some people are angry.
A fan on Twitter described the children's cartoon change as "a kind of dirty joke".
"They had to change the children's cartoon because it was not appropriate to show such a show at 6am according to government regulations", said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
- Papa the Pig, yes.
Scott Coker, president of the Bellator company, said he would work on scheduling in the future with UK visitors in mind.
"We may be able to solve it in the course of the ripple", Coker said.
"But now it's Sunday morning at six and we're Sunday, they can't do it until Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched it, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical error.
But no, it was a government matter.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to five fights instead of six -- as we normally do -- in an effort to give fans more than they need.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley suffers from "sexism".
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he suffered from sexual inferiority while growing up - but it inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said she didn't realize "not everyone is like me" until she went to secondary school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights in giving others hope.
She also said that after the birth of her child, her thoughts about her Olympic victory have diminished.
The long-running show's regular host, Christy Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a social outcast at Laverne's first event, Daly said she felt "smaller" than everyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
To this day, the feeling of being small and feeling different is still the reality that gave me the strength and determination to succeed.
She said she wanted to prove herself as "something" so that when everyone knew about her sexuality, everyone would not be disappointed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT promoter and has used her presence to appeal to more countries to recognise homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he opened his mouth because he felt lucky to live in public without complications and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion spoke about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - who surprised me.
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her.
"When you go through so much at such a young age - she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was hard to find someone her age who had seen so many ups and downs in life.
The couple had a son in June named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dalley said his "entire outlook" had changed.
He said that if you asked me last year, I would have said I have to win a gold medal.
To be honest, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
Ravi is my Olympic gold medalist.
Her son is named after his father Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daly said his father never admitted that he was going to die and he eventually asked if their tickets for London 2012 were confirmed - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I never could have said that you would not be there to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing and I didn't admit that she wasn't invincible until she took her last breath and died", he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
He said that this was my lifelong dream - to dive in front of my Olympic audience, there is no better feeling.
It also inspired her first song choice - Heather Small's Pride - which resonated with her in the run-up to the Olympics and which still haunts her.
Desert Island Disc on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who is out of form, will be on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to return to his form if he doesn't want to make it an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played a record 12 times in the biennial event, had to sit on the bench for Saturday's Foursome and Foursome instead of Captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being the center of attention, as she was in the US game, the five-time major winner spent her days cheering and improving her game on the range.
Not always comfortable with drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not suited to the Tight Le Golf National Course, where the long rough often gets long shots in the way.
And if the course itself isn't bad enough, Mickelson, in Game 9, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has won all four of their matches this week, teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 singles match, can get off to a good start, Mickelson's match could prove crucial.
Furik has shown confidence in him, although he has not much to say.
He has fully understood his role today, put his hand on my shoulder and said he is ready for tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's given a lot to this team, past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that's what happened and that's how we thought we'd go about it.
He wants to get on the field, just like everyone else.
In Sunday's match, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games.
This could end a Ryder Cup career that doesn't even match his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, although Furyk says his presence lifts the team up.
He is also funny, funny, intelligent, likes to make people laugh, likes to be in the team room and is a great guy, he said.
I think the new players have enjoyed playing with him, this week, which is great to see.
He offers more than just a game.
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that even the big lead can disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a big lead in the Ryder Cup can be a very uncomfortable situation even if he drops to singles on the final day.
Dan's debut came in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Savi Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but somehow crossed the finish line by only a narrow margin and won by 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a nominal margin", said Bjorn, who is pictured on Friday and yesterday both days leading 10-6 from a 5-3 win at Le Golf National in the 2018 class.
History will show me and the team that this is not over.
Go down tomorrow with all your energy.
Get out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until the board is up.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win a trophy, and that's what we'll have the eyes for.
I always say that I'm looking at the 12 players on my team, but we're also very aware of who's on the other side - the best players in the world.
I am happy with the way our players have performed on the tough golf course.
Tomorrow is a different fight.
Tomorrow's performance will be personal, and that's a different thing.
It's great to have a partner when everything's going well, but when you're on the court alone, your ability as a golfer is put to the ultimate test.
This message needs to reach all the players who have to give their best tomorrow.
Now, you have to move on from your partner and make the best of it.
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will be watching to see if the players individually improve on what they have played as a team, with the exception of Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who have picked up three of the four points.
Furyq himself has experienced the dramatic turnaround of the final day as part of the team that lost in Europe's "Miracle in Medina" and won in Brooklyn.
Asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had cheered up his players before he went down on the final day of 1999, he said: "I remember every word".
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you're gonna want to get rid of starting as fast as Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game is tilted to one side, there is a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We'll line up and we'll put the guys down the way we thought, and we're actually going to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with leading the defense against top-order Europeans including Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter. He will face Rory McIlroy in the opening match.
"I have arranged this group in this order because I think it will cover everything", Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
The new German battleship is delayed again.
The T, the German Navy's newest batch of warships to replace earlier Cold War-era warships, was due to be launched in 2014, but due to faulty systems and the cost of snowballing, will not be until at least next year, local media reports.
The launch of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the Rhineland-Palatinate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the military spokesman quoted Die Zeit as saying.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project has been hampered by post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are reported to be equipped with powerful artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include long maintenance times - it will be possible to deploy new frigates away from the country's port for a maximum of two years.
However, the continued delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships - which are supposed to help Germany show off its power abroad - will be obsolete by the time they go into the water, Die Zeit reports.
The ill-fated F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to launch the ship and sent it back to the Blum and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a ship has been returned to the shipbuilder after delivery by the Navy.
Little is known about the reasons behind the withdrawal, but German media cite several important "software and hardware flaws" that would render the ship useless in battle.
The software's gills are particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the manpower of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was overly heavy which would reduce its performance and hinder the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Palatinate" is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
The initial level of £2.2 billion has risen to a staggering £3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The new frigates, which are in trouble, have become even more important in the wake of recent warnings of a shrinking German navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was "running out of the right ships for the Motaine".
The official said the problem has grown over time, as no replacement ships have been brought in to replace the old ones that were cancelled.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships had been able to join the fleet.
The secret life of bats is not under the control of the National Trust.
New research is being conducted at an estate in the Scottish Highlands to learn how bats use ground moulds to find food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help in future conservation efforts.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will continue to study the common and soprano pipeserrels and the Dobenton bats at the Inverurie Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the area to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
The expert will analyze all the sound recordings to determine the vibration of the bat's call and find out what species is doing.
A landscape map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
NTS conservation advisor Rob Deere hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help in determining the benefits of habitat management, such as grassland creation and how to protect forest land for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically.
They are at risk for building and development work that damages their sleeping places and habitat.
There may also be hazards from wind-based turbines and lights, such as from flypaper and some chemicals in building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their night-time hunting habits, their ears are more effective than their eyes at hunting.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to identify hazards and obstacles on the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has given importance to bats.
They have 10 trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspect sleeping areas and sometimes rescue operations.
The company also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, said the estate is an ideal area for bats.
"There is a good area for bats in Thrive", he said.
There are old buildings, many old trees and all good houses.
But there is still a lot that is unknown about bats, so what we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to survive".
He stressed the importance of knowing the presence of bats before maintaining the property, as this could lead to the destruction of 400 female and baby bats due to unintentional destruction of a parent's habitat, and the complete eradication of the local bat population.
Bats are protected animals and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about bats and we know nothing about how many species live", he said.
Ronaldo denies rape charges and lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper
Anna called the rape allegations against her "fake news" and said that people wanted to "promote" themselves with her name.
Her lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has made the allegation public.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was allegedly paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video hours after the claim was made public, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the report "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to.
What they said today is fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's common.
They want to be famous for my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is going well.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they described as "unacceptable reports that are suspect in terms of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player should seek compensation for "moral damage in the light of the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy rights in recent times".
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorca went to the player's home after meeting at a nightclub, where he raped her anally.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo pleaded with him after the incident and told him that he was disappointed for "99 percent" "good people", "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that he went to the police and had his wounds photographed in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement, as he was "scared of reprisals" and feared being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she now wants to bring the settlement up again, as she is emotionally devastated by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the process of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the crime and joined the famous Italian club Juventus in a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing its position as a car manufacturer
Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" losing its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Barnston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker says that a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses due to border delays.
The plant in Burnston - which makes Toyota Auris and Avenis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, about 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory could stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Burnston.
Other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will be managed.
For example, BMW has said it will close its mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concern that carmakers say is the risk to supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming in every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for the ordered vehicle.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruptions at the border that could cause delays in parts supplies and a shortage of parts, according to trade unions.
The company said it was not possible to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at Toyota's Derbyshire plant, which could lead to production being halted.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's Checks Plan for future relations with the EU was designed to avoid such checks at the border.
We want to make the best deal that not only sustains the success but also allows us to enjoy the potential for future improvement", he told a show on BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not only Toyota but other manufacturers are proving that it is crucial to maintain the successful supply chain system that we have".
Toyota is unable to say how long production will be shut down, but they warn that in the long run, the excess costs will reduce the factory's competitiveness and could result in many jobs being lost.
Peter Suvaleris, a 24-year-old Burnton employee and United Union advocate at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs are gone, they don't come back.
"We need to have a clear and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU", a government spokesman said.
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be further delayed.
Amid tensions over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week", the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
There has been a lot of buzz in Washington over the past few months about whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and question Mueller's freedom.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of secret microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he reportedly visited the White House on Monday following reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when Trump was at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, after Kavanaugh and one of the women who brought sexual misconduct allegations against him, Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
"There is no date set for the meeting with Rosenstein, it could be this week, it could be postponed another week due to all the other current Supreme Court matters", he said.
But let's show it and I always like to tell the media.
Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reason for not holding the briefing was not because of the annoyance with the reporters, although he said: "I don't deny that they did the show".
He then suggested increasing direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The current president has more question and answer sessions than any president before him", he said without citing any evidence: "We have judged that number".
"But if the media gets a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me", Sanders said.
We try very hard to do that and you've seen us do that over the last few weeks and the press briefings are going to be replaced by talking directly to the president of the United States".
Trump receives regular questions when leaving the White House or attending inaugural sessions or press conferences with distinguished guests.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why unplanned actions and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of a team of reporters can be so unpleasant.
Health minister writes letter to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health expressed the country's gratitude to EU staff working on Scotland's NHS and expressed their desire to stay on post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to reimburse EU citizens for the cost of settled status applications to work in the country's public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Brexit talks between the UK and EU have been ongoing throughout the summer, with a conclusion expected this autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know you are all going through a very stressful time.
I would like to remind you that I value the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and expertise that has strengthened and improved healthcare and benefited patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Emergency surgery on Christian Abercrombie after he sustained a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
He was on the sidelines, and he passed out, Reed said.
Trainees and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines and later brought him back for further testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that this time, McCrumb was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/type of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine the time of the injury.

He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK.
Under the Tory scheme, foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy new property in the UK and the extra money will be spent on helping the homeless.
This move will undermine the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury hopes this will raise revenue and provide up to £120 million a year in additional funding to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be spent on helping the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move would undermine the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters while providing more affordable housing and targeting higher income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will go to the government to help the homeless.
Surcharge - which is more than three percent of the current stamp duty, which was imposed on second homes and rental houses at higher rates two years ago.
The Treasury expects this to increase revenues to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of all newly built properties in London are being bought by residents outside the UK, which has driven up prices and made things more difficult for first-time home buyers.
Most of the country's elite areas - especially the capital - are becoming "unknown cities" with crowds of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help younger generations buy their first homes.
She has accused big construction companies of buying land and increasing property prices without using it, and called on Ms Mack to scrap the affordable housing quota to address Britain's "housing problem".
Mr. Corbyn announced an exciting series of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
"Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - which is that life should be better for everyone in the new generation.
And that means fixing the broken home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that foreigners and foreign private companies not resident in the UK will buy property as easily as hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home is far from being realized, and the problem of homelessness remains very real.
My ultimate dream is to take over Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate wish" is to manage Scotland one day in the future.
The 42-year-old, from Scotland, is currently enjoying the challenge of re-branding the North East club, who are now third in League One, three points behind the first team.
He returned St Marys to the Scottish Premiership last season and moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my dad as a kid and it always pulls me back.
This opportunity will only come if I manage the club successfully.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not disappointed to turn down offers from established names like Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me at this point will be 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
This club is undoubtedly deserving of the Premier League because of the structure and facilities", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see myself as successful if I can get the club back there".
Ross's managerial career is currently just three years old after 15 months as assistant boss and coaching staff at Dumbarton and Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and convert St Mirren from relegation gate to championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable here than his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academicals.
"It was probably a real milestone", he recalled of Alya's taking charge.
"I really believed that management was more for me than sports.
It sounds strange because I did all right, I lived a fairly good life and I had some success.
But the game is hard.
You have to go through a lot of stuff every week.
I still feel the same way about the workload, but the management seems to be the right one.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing in my entire adult life in my own skin".

The summer heat wave has increased crowds in Britain's smoking pubs, but it has put pressure on the restaurant chain.
Pubs and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, business consultant at CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The continuing sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup attendance mean that the same trend as last June will continue in July, when pubs saw sales rise by 2.8 per cent and restaurants saw sales decline.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant business in June was worse in July.
The main drinking pubs and bars have done very well so far and the sales of the restaurants have been just as bad.
Food pubs are also suffering from the heat, but their sales are not as low as restaurants.
It seems people are just going out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell by three percent".
"The trend of late April is still going on", said Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM.
Outdoor market sales are most affected by weather and major social or sporting events.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups will be in a tough situation, but this 4.8 percent drop in sales year over year will be especially painful.
Food may not come at a bad time for the main operators from the long and hot summer and only time will tell if the mild weather in August will bring some relief.
In July, total sales growth in pubs and restaurants with new openings was 2.7 per cent, reflecting a decline in sales at brand roll-outs.
Coffer Pitch Tracker Industry Sales Monitor of the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collected and analysed performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 million, and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children have a secret social media account that they keep hidden from their parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake" Instagram pages.
The news raised fears that sexual content was being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social media account to hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found that fake Instagram - the photo-sharing site Instagram - is relevant, with accounts growing rapidly.
The news raised fears that sexual content was being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a transparent "main" account to show their parents, but also to hide.
A mother who visited the hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter saw a teenager calling out to others "rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitting to having a secret account.
"It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places that parents and teachers can't find", said HMC chief Mike Buchanan.
Elijah Doyle will be the Voice for Athletes at the Scottish Athletic Board.
Eliud Doyle has been elected as an Executive Director to the Scottish Athletics Board at the Governing Body's Annual General Meeting.
Doyle, Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty, described the move as a great opportunity for sports managers to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Elidh is widely respected throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are sure that we would benefit immensely from bringing him to the Scottish Athletics Board", said Beatty.
"I am keen to serve as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really help and take sport forward in Scotland", said Doyle.
The American, who won four Olympic golds, including the 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996, and is now a regular BBC pundit, has stopped walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said that only time would tell how much I could recover.
It was a lot of hard work, but now I'm fully recovered, I've learned to walk again and I started working out again today!
Thank you for the inspiring message!
The Internet is divided between mother and cow in breast pump advertising
A breast pump company has split the internet with an ad comparing baby mothers to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of what is being billed as "the world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company LV released a hilarious music video ad to showcase the freedom the new pump offers modern mothers.
Four real mothers are driving a hay-filled cow to a song that includes the lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If no one sees, these are not animal legs, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump and bar, pump and bar, I feed the children, pump and bar, I milk my girlfriends".
However, the ad, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has generated controversy online.
The video received mixed reactions from viewers with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, many saying it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows in advertising this product is a bad decision.
They need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk like us, the difference is that their babies are stolen from them within days of birth", one wrote.
LV breast pump is nicely placed inside any nursing bra (LV/M)
Another commented: "Apparently it's frustrating for both mother and child.
But why not use them in breast pump advertisements for mothers who are close to their babies?
Another said: "Very uncomfortable advertising".
Others have stood by the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "pleasant".
I think it's a great idea.
If I was breastfeeding the baby, I'd have one too.
I feel like a cow when I pump.
The ad was a little crazy, but I took it well.
This is an innovative product, one wrote.
Another commented: "It's a juicy ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and think they're "cows".
This advert is neither a praise nor a criticism of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women say they all dance with the pump hidden in their bras.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like cows when they pump their breasts.
Although the LV pump is completely silent, it has no wires or tubes and fits nicely into the nursing bra, which allows women the freedom to walk, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Anna Ballarin, MADER's partner and ECD says: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product that should be launched in a bold and exciting way.
By drawing parallel images of women and lactating cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, expressing the incredible sense of liberation that the new pump will bring in an entertaining and relevant way.
This is not the first time that the LV pump has been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two used the product to walk the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children are being quietly taken to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained immigrant children has increased, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's strict rules and policies have made it harder to keep children with their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been afraid of losing their own chances of staying in the country by claiming undocumented immigrants and children.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor orphans.
The agency later said that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal history.
"About 80 percent of the family members of the sponsor are in the country illegally and a large number of them are high-level criminals.
So we are continuing to search for them", said Nister Albanes.
In an effort to reintegrate children into society more quickly, officials introduced some new rules including a requirement to appear in court within a month of detention, from 60 days previously, asylum seekers said.
Many will appear in person at the immigration judge's courtroom during their trial for legal status rather than via video conference call.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent incidents or escape attempts.
Supporters say the concerns are even more acute in large centres like Tornillo, where children are found to be more anxious, and more likely to be neglected, because of their size.
They also said that many may be more traumatized than they already are if they are moved to the centre without being allowed to be mentally prepared or given enough time to say goodbye to friends.
US, French and Turkish 'occupation forces' are being asked to withdraw immediately from Syria
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite eight years of war in the country.
Moyalem, who is also the country's deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on the country's soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will take appropriate action".
"They must leave now without conditions", he told the council.
Moualem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue the war against both terrorists and "illegal foreign presence" until all Syrian territory was cleared.
The US has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are stationed in the war-torn country.
Asked about the refugees, Moalim said the situation was conducive to their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unjustified fear" that has led the refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this return", he said.
They are making politics about the whole human problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached aimed at ending the war between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel base, provides an opportunity to move forward through political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, which is home to three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear timeline" and expressed hope that the military action would work against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "eradicated".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moallem conditioned the Syrian government's participation in the committee on the fact that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution", and he warned against unwanted interference.
Why Trump should win the second round
In this argument, Trump will win re-election in 2020, as many liberals likely expect his presidency to end prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
"It will be the most dramatic end of any president!"
So far, there is no sign of the audience changing their minds.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings on CNN have more than doubled to about 1.05 million, and for MSNBC it has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News's average prime-time viewership has increased from 1.7 million last year to about 2.4 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the ratings with about 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
Of a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack, director of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, Neil Baer, said, "It's a fire that's attracting people, because it's beyond our comprehension".
Another theory is that veteran comedy writer Nell Scovel and the creator of "Just the Funny Parts: The Hollywood Boys Club's Some Hidden Hard Truths" are the same people.
He recalled a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver asked him if he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked.
He says, "For reasons of fun, Miss Scovel told me".
This chaos has some entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the issues that emerge from Washington can determine the future of the Row Five.
Touring is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
And yet, it would be beyond the comprehension of an informed citizen to watch a panel of experts debate for six hours over the use of "deep background" for Bob Woodward's book "Fear", and Paul Manafort's $15,000 camel-skin bomber jacket (the Washington Post says "thick suit with hubris") and Mr. Trump's, um, physiological details of Stormy Daniels' opening remarks.
I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
Speaking about the daily rotating cast of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un), Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "Pon Stars", said, "Some of what he does is like a reality show, every night he's doing some fun snacks".
You can't miss an episode or not watch it.
When I spoke to Mr. Flies this week, it was 80s outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was still at home watching CNN.
He couldn't get out of the tension between Brett Kavanaugh's confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future hanging over the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all the great shows in the autumn days and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Flies told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it's real.

Foreign money flooded into the midterm elections
It's no surprise that money is flying in Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, as two candidates battle for the same seat courtesy of a congressional redistricting.
The recently re-organized Pittsburgh suburb of Pittsburg District A has brought Democratic Representative Connor Lamb to the race - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, much of which is part of the new 17th district.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally unfairly aligned in favor of Republicans, leading to the redrawing of the map.
The election campaign in the new 17th district has involved a money-driving competition between the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb rose to prominence after winning a highly publicized special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District by a narrow margin in March.
The seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits are giving the Democrats a little head start.
El Salvador punished by the US for supporting China, later withdrawn
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, a slight departure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama, but the partners later removed the Trump Organization's board of directors.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that "in light of the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department officials decided to repatriate the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
However, only El Salvador was convicted, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017 in the areas of drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which included cutting financial aid and imposing specific visa bans, could have been painful for the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting progressed, officials in North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a step to prevent immigrants from pouring into the US like last year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear they wanted to hold the conference, effectively ending the possibility of El Salvador's sentence.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, to give the administration a message on imports.
And the US ambassadors from the three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the statements by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their statement was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also declined to be named.
Read the history
The next inevitable event could be Robert Mueller's special report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now ample evidence in the public record.
The investigation into Mr. Mueller's involvement with Russia during the election is reportedly turning.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to take his responsibilities, just as he is preparing to go before voters again and may eventually have to go before a jury with his colleagues.
There are many if-buts, and I'm not saying that the fall of Mr. Trump, or his European counterpart, is inevitable.
The people on both sides of the Atlantic will have a choice in how long this conflict will last.
In 1938 German officials might have "coupled" against Hitler, if the West had not stopped him and sided with the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed a chance to avoid years of murder.
The course of history often takes such a turn, and in it the tremendous pace of democracy is sometimes accelerated, sometimes delayed.
This is a turning point in American history.
What should we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger since it was revealed in the paper last year that he had secretly suggested recording the president's speech and speculated about his own incompetence in his position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times was false.
"What would be our reaction if the newly launched FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh were incomplete or unfair - or if he were proven innocent in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
The bigger question is, will we elect a Congress in the midterm elections that can blame Mr. Trump?
If we fail this test, democracy will go into a long-term hibernation.
But I believe we will not fail, because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazis who occupied my embassy house.
He survived, escaped to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table marked with a swastika.
With this history, how can I not be optimistic about the future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and author of The Last Palace: Five Lives and a Great House: A Turbulent Century in Europe.
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the Vienna Rapid Battle.
Rangers will play Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and if they win against the Austrians after a remarkable draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they will have a good chance of qualifying from Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrance played his first game of the season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal due to a knee injury, but he believes they can build on this result to get to a better place.
"This point is very important, because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
We got on the field with confidence and took a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, the draw seems a fair result.
They played well in the first half and our team played well in the second half.
Thursday, another big night on the European stage.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will be a tough game, because they had a good result in their last game, but I am sure that with the support of the audience we can get a positive result.
Last year was not so good, because of my injury and all the changes that have taken place at the club, but now I feel good about the situation.
Our team is good and the boys are having a great time; they are training well.
I hope that we can move on from the past season and be successful.
Women are losing sleep over saving for retirement.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had some idea of how to deal with it, few people talked about it with their family members.
Half of Nationwide's survey respondents said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their child about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not taking action on that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
Know where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not communicate your desires well in advance, you will not prepare your family for your ministry.
Work in touch with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you want to receive care, as your preferred cost setting is also important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can find solutions to manage these costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, if you have the funds - a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy or self-insurance with your own funds to help with these costs.
Find solutions from your legal documents: Try to avoid legal battles.
Get a proper healthcare proxy so that you nominate someone you trust to oversee your medical care and so that the professional will honor your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
And, please, keep in mind a power of attorney for your property.
Choose a trusted person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid correctly while you are disabled.
Remember the little things: Suppose your elderly parent needs emergency medical care and is rushed to the hospital.
Are you aware of her allergies and current medications?
Keep these things in a written plan so that you can be prepared.
"And it's not just the economy, the doctors are also a factor", Marttick said.
What is the current medication?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep everything planned.
A man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home after a night out.
The victim, a 40-year-old Devon man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The officials said in a statement that the isolated incident occurred at 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not serious and police have called for witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise further.
As communication was lost, relief workers were unable to report any reports from the Dangala Regency area north of Palu, which is located near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
From Palu, more than 16,000 people have been rescued after the disaster.
Some key facts about the Palu and Donga of Sulawesi:
The capital of Central Sulawesi state is Palu, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongola is a regency that stretches for about 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which has a lower status than the state, has an estimated population of 299,200 as of 2017.
The main sources of economy in Central Sulawesi state, especially in the coastal region of Dongola, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important in the state, but most of it is located on the opposite side of the Sulawesi coast, in Morowali.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Dongola have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed about 200 people in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Dongla was also hit by a tsunami in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is often hit by earthquakes because of its location in the earthquake-prone Pacific volcanic region.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently:
2004: A major earthquake on December 26 caused a tsunami along the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia's North Sumatra that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami to sweep the southern coast and killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hits near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter high tsunami that washed out dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Aceh PD Jaya Regency, wreaking havoc and spreading panic with the terrible memories of the 2004 tsunami.
Although there were no tsunami disasters, more than 100 people died when their homes collapsed.
2018: A major earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombo, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of homes were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped.
Sarah Paulin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Paulin, the eldest son of Alaska Governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Paulin, has been charged with the attack.
According to a report by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Pauline, from Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence and attempting to evade arrest.
According to police reports, when a woman he knew went to call the police in the wake of the incident, he took the phone away from her.
Pauline is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Prison Facility on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he claimed "confirmed innocence", the network reported.
He is charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
And it's a class B felony charge, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Pauline has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Phillips.
His mother, Sarah Pauline, called the police about the attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, including domestic violence and drug use.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
In 2016, the Veterans Group criticized Sarah Paulin for linking her son's violent behavior to her PTSD service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications were cut and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The tremor was felt near Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video of the moment of the incident is circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered to participate in the beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare death sentence that has not been carried out since 1953.
It is alleged that Sipov, 30, used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bicycle lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, crushing cyclists and pedestrians.
The death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York requires prosecutors to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious injury to carry out the death penalty.
Both are sufficient to carry out the death penalty, according to court documents.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, which are usually brought in the context of organized crime, and charges of violence and car destruction.
The prosecutors said that the "abominable, cruel and perverse" attack by Saipov required "adequate planning and foresight".
Saifullo Habibullayevich Saipov whose family and friends have been injured, injured and damaged by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Lora Decatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damián Mendoza,  Notice from the Intent State.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York carried out its last execution more than a decade ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953, against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, has not expressed any remorse, the court report says.
Police said he was happy after the incident.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone at home, the complaint said.
Police said he also requested that the ISIS flag be planted in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Sipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than granting a life sentence will prolong the trauma of this incident for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's legal team had previously appealed for the prosecutors' death sentences to be overturned.
Tory MP said Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit compromise negotiations.
Nigel Farage has vowed to unite the mob in a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had been 'warmed up' by Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs said she should be given the task of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Bown told a Birmingham rally that if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary, the UK would have already 'left' the EU.
But the frosty nature of Mrs May's efforts to keep her deeply divided bureaucracy together was once again made clear when the anti-Brexit Tories took part in another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
One of these pro-Brexit anti-Brexit and EU attackers is the Chequers who are frostbite to keep the deal on track.
His allies insisted that he should strike a deal with Brussels despite opposition - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bon Solihull told the Liv Mines Liv rally that he wanted 'Chuck Checkers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a colleague and given the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have gotten out of this", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I would support Brexit, but Chuck Checker is needed".
He told his opponents in the EU: "We did not fight the world war to live by it.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bowen has ruled out the possibility of a change in public opinion after the 2016 vote. The idea that the British people want to stay in the EU is completely false.
Tory Brexit supporter Andre Jenkins was also at the rally, telling reporters: "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chechens are the dislike of the general public, the opposition will not vote for them, and the dislike of our party people and activists who have brought us here.
Take off your checker and try to listen.
Addressing Mrs May in sharp language, he added: "The Prime Minister is thinking about his post where he should keep his promise".
Mr Farage told the rally that if the 2016 referendum decision was betrayed, politicians should be forced to understand the "disaster situation".
"It has now become a matter of trust among the people and politicians", he said.
They are trying to betray us with Brexit and we will tell them that if they do, we will not let you escape.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want the politicians who are trying to betray Brexit to face the facts.
We are leading the people's army that won us Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit demonstrators marched for two hours through the city centre in Birmingham.
A group of workers have been displaying Brexit banners against the Tories since they were formed later this week.
Labour Party leader Adonis mocks Conservatives at a conference after a security issue with a party app.
"Some people tell us that they can have a smooth border, unhindered free trade at the Irish border, Canada Plus Plus and the IT system is fine", he added.
This is a complete prank.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is considering a "scrutiny" on running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, the Boston Globe reported.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state candidate Geoff Deal, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There is talk around him that he could be a contender with Trump in the 2020 election.
The meeting with Trump's organizers at Holyoke Town Hall on Saturday evening was the 36th since Trump took office.
One participant asked him about his presidential candidacy.
Warren responded, "It's time to fix our broken government under the leadership of a woman".
Arrested for shooting Sims of the LSU.
Baton Rouge, LA police said Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Deaton Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said, ET News Conference.
They released a video of a shooting on Friday, asking for the identification of the person in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that Wade Sims died from a gunshot wound to the head, 247Sports reports.
Wade was attacked by Simpson while trying to save his friend.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, having a weapon, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, started 10 games and played in 32 games last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world title on the gift of a win from teammate Sebastian Vettel
This was only made clear when Valter Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday and said that the Mercedes team order would play a key role in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole, almost ignoring Hamilton, holding his own in the first two turns and inviting Vettel to attack his own team-mate.
Vettel left Hamilton behind in the crowd and ran into Pete himself, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver pitched the next lap and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton Tanton took the lead after the fight, showing that the Ferrari driver made a double-move and left the inside empty with the risk of accidentally missing an opportunity.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was seventh after the first lap.
He then led for much of the race, then finished fourth behind Kimi Räikkönen on the bad tyres.
He pitched on lap 44, but could not accelerate on the remaining eight laps, leaving Raccoon in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valterie fought hard all weekend and acted like a real gentleman.
The team is doing a great job of getting in first place, Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for alleging that he did not leak a letter written by Christine Blazy Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the issue directly, instead saying that what was happening in the Senate was a reflection of the "low and ugly and lying" mentality of the people.
"This is one thing that could have happened and the nice thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few weeks is that you see anger when you see people who are mean and ugly and lying", he said.
When they see the leak, they're like, "Oh, I didn't do it".
Oh, I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak something?
Remember his answer... did you leak the documents... oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak.
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked-- no, we didn't, he said, impersonating the senator.
The letter, which described the allegations against Kavanaugh, was sent to Ford Feinstein in July, and leaked in September - but Feinstein denied the leak from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak anything", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
He told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as he said.
But the president didn't digest his words, opening up at a rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what happened, it was bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Speaking in favor of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations to their own ends.
They want power back at any cost.
Look at the low mentality, look at the cruelty, it doesn't stop them from hurting anyone, it doesn't stop them from trampling anyone to gain power and control", the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by a score of 3-0.
Patrick Dyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.

The air traffic controller has saved hundreds of lives from the earthquake at the cost of his own life.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died helping a plane carrying hundreds of passengers to take off.
More than 800 people died on Sulawesi island on Friday in a tsunami caused by a major earthquake and many are still missing.
The area is being shaken by strong aftershocks and people are trapped in the rubble.
But despite all his colleagues fleeing in fear for their lives, 21-year-old Antonis Gunawan Palur Mutiara did not leave the horribly swaying control tower at Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, could fly safely.
Then he jumped down, fearing the control tower would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirit said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We arrange a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter reached Palu this morning.
"We are heartbroken to hear this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could exceed a thousand, with the disaster response agency reporting that communication between the cities of Dongola, Sighi and Butong has been limited.
"The death toll is believed to be increasing as many bodies are trapped under the rubble that have not yet been reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Puroyo Nugroho.
A six-meter high wave wrecked the leak in Palu where a mass grave will be held on Sunday.
Relief and assistance is being brought by military and commercial aircraft.
Reesa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "A body is coming in every minute in the ambulance.
Clean water is not available.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfond, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quickly getting help to the survivors, but we don't know what we will see there.
It's already sad, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge you to work day and night to rescue.
Are you ready?  CNN report.
Earlier this year, Lombo, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing in Micronesia plane crash
When an airline plane crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a report on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate him.
The airline immediately declined to provide details such as the passenger's age and nationality.
Some local boats assist in rescuing passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuck Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident is still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane went down before reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jans said the plane went down too low.
"Which is a very good thing", Jens said.
Jens said he and others reached the emergency door of the sinking plane through the waist water.
He said the flight crew was screaming in fear and he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working on a nearby jetty repair were also helping with the rescue, bringing people to shore in air-laden boats before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
The Aviation Safety Network estimates that 111 people have died on PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but no accidents have occurred on Air New Guinea.
Analysts have been able to pinpoint the time of the burning of the woman alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday set the case for a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cellphone records to create the events of the night of his death of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
Rowlett said she recovered several cellphone records that suggested Telles and Chambers were together on the evening of the death, contrary to Telles's previous claim, the Clarion Laser report.
The information indicates that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time, although he claims he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who the police spoke to.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that night.
When prosecutors questioned whether Telles was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that it was "a lie, because his truck was in Nashville that night".
Another discrepancy is that Telles said she knew Chambers from two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said Teles deleted text, call and contact information from his phone shortly after Chambers' death.
"She wiped him out of her life", Haley said.
The final argument in the case is scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to the jury the next day.
What is Kansas hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative attitudes of the genre by bringing a positive message to the music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has moved away from its mainstream political message and address social issues.
They want to get back into their mainstream and make Kansas hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence in the UK recently through artists like Akala and Loki.
Another black guy?!
New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a racist text.
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal for receiving a misleading text from a mother who called her "another black".
The couple denied the accusation of racism and sought a trial on charges of "bullying".
Lynsey Plasko-Falksman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment after arriving on her first day of work in 2016 to learn that Giselle Morris, the new baby-sitter, was black.
Another black woman, Mrs. Plasco-Falksman, texted her husband.
Anyway, she sent it to Miss Morris, twice, instead of her husband.
Later realizing her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Placebo-Falksman fired Ms. Morris, saying that their previous nanny, who was African-American, performed poorly and that she expected a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Ms. Morris was given a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation in the case of the eviction and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for six months, although she was initially hired as a nanny at home without any contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do that", he told the post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple countered the claim that they were racist by saying that firing Morris was a reasonable thing to do for fear that he would not be trusted after being charged.
He didn't want to tell me what my wife sent.
He's not racist.
We are not a racist couple, husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have mistreated, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
What's that?
On Zulum's complaint, Plasko said his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in "very difficult circumstances".
Would you want to go against someone like that?
It's not a good thing to do, the investment banker said.
The People's Court has been sharply condemned on social media for the couple's behaviour and arguments as the legal case is ongoing.
Paddington Publishing fears that readers may not be able to relate to the talking bear, new paper reveals.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to say what will be in the mind of the first reader before it's published.
It's interesting to know after the huge success of Paddington.
To this, she said she was optimistic about rejecting her work from her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write children's books from a small toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweet" to her after her death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she said her father was very proud of her ultimate achievement.
"He was a quiet man, and not a proud man", he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that it was as if your own child had achieved something: you are proud of him, even though you had nothing to do with it.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a way that kind of looked like that.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Soon after landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Nad regularly called to say it was too bad, and that she probably wouldn't survive, said Ms. Ednan-Laperoz.
Then I got a call from Ned and found out he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
And I did.
I say, "Tashi, darling, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be right there.
The medication the doctors gave him to keep his heart going was slowly shutting down and leaving his body.
He died a few minutes ago and then it all stopped.
I had no choice but to sit and wait, knowing everything.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz, then mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - she was dismayed by the difficult situation.
No one knew, he said.
I was bowed, my eyes watering.
It's impossible to describe, but I was on the plane, experiencing Nad's excruciating pain.
That he needs my love and sympathy.
I know how much she loved him.
This woman posted a suicide stop card on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries post cards with inspirational messages at Welsh Bridge and put up a phone number where people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression since he was 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I represent", he said.
Miss Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said her smile brightened the house.
Anyway, he quit before he died, because he was really going into the dark.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found him dead.
Ms Davis said: "I am constantly worried that this effort will fail".
Miss Davis made a card to let everyone know that there is someone you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still - we need to talk.
Miss Humphries, who has been Miss Davis' girlfriend for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"She never said she was upset or depressed or anything", he said.
I noticed some changes in her behavior two days before Christmas.
On Christmas Day, she was in a terrible state - she didn't even look at the children as they opened their presents.
He said his death was a huge emotional blow for them, but they had to overcome it: It created a huge void in the family.
They separated us.
But we have to walk and fight.

As the FBI investigation begins, Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question.
"I thought, if we could give him something he wanted - given the limited time, limited scope of the investigation - we could perhaps bring some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee might "break up" in the face of this biased impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their obligations are time-related.
With just five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, their efforts to get their man on the nation's highest court will be very weak.
George W. Bush is calling the senators and urging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who served in the White House under Mr. Bush. Through him, Mr. Bush met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is filed?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would break the tie for Vice President Mike Pence to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has declined under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-seok, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said the number of defectors last year was 1,127 - up from 2,706 in 2011.
The main reasons for this, Mr. Park said, are the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the suppression of money from human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
A large number of North Korean defectors have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have fled through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees not as refugees but as illegal immigrants and often forcibly returns them to their home countries.
Relations between North and South Korea - who are still in fact at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This follows a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they roughly agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on US sanctions.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we won't have confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally", Mr. Ri said in an address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but think that a woman who would have done something like this would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denies the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazy when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, screaming and gasping for breath as he talked about his family and high school life.
He explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "an absurd and manipulative characterization organized by liberals" and alleging that they were made out of anger at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is not qualified for the Supreme Court, as it shows that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he has proven himself incompetent in the statements he has made and the way he has been denouncing Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
When asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi expressed hesitation.
"I will say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but he's unfit for the court he's in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Cavanov would oppose the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because she herself is a conservative justice.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It cannot be allowed that a hysterical, biased person will go to court and tell us 'Isn't this great?'"
And women should be in control of it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger coming out, and he can't stop crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinmeier told me after 45 years.
I don't think it's rare, what do you say?
She added: "I was helped a lot by a female executive who said that she cried when she was angry too, but she chose this approach: when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You must think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was really angry.
Then he would go on.
I thought it was amazing.
Tears serve in part as an expression of anger, because they are primarily misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of an early job, in a male-dominated office, is when I saw myself crying in incredible anger, an elderly woman holding my scarf -- a scary manager I was always a little afraid of -- who pulled me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you.
Patrick Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with him during Gary Hart's presidential campaign.
When Mr. Hart is caught in a monkey business overseas in 1987 about an affair and is dropped from the race for dirty work, deeply depressed Ms. Schroeder thinks there's no reason she can't run for president herself.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision", he said with a smile after 30 years.
Seven other candidates are already in the race, and no one wanted another candidate.
One called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
He was behind on fundraising because the campaign was delayed and so he vowed not to run until he had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that if a supporter gave a man $1,000, he was given only $250.
"Do they think I will get a discount?" he said surprised.
When she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was overcome with emotion and gratitude to her supporters, frustrated with the system that makes it difficult to raise money, which she targets voters rather than representatives, and sick with anger about gender inequality.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder said, recalling the media reaction.
You might think that the clinics are my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, where are they gonna bury me?
Did he cry?
How this US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The first phase of the US-China trade war was noisy, and while the war is in its final stages, Beijing may benefit from the conflict in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump was the first to warn earlier this year of higher tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant move came this week, when new tariffs were imposed on nearly half of total imports from China, amounting to about $200 billion (£150 billion).
Beijing has retaliated every time - most recently by raising tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has decided to fight head on and the world's second largest economy is not likely to look down anytime soon.
To back down from Washington would mean to roll over claims, but to publicly bow to the US would be highly insulting to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the U.S. trade war pressure could help China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"Any quick political decision by Washington or Beijing that could lead to the onset of economic collapse in either country is far more dangerous than most people think", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank that focuses on Asia.
Syria is "ready to take back its refugees", the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees, and has called for them to rebuild the country devastated by seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation is stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing the rehabilitation to restore normalcy in areas devastated by terrorists.
The situation is now favourable for people forced to leave their country due to disruption of their daily lives and livelihoods due to terrorism and the surrounding economic situation to return voluntarily.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian government welcomes all assistance in rebuilding the country.
But he also stressed that no conditional assistance would be accepted or that the aid of the countries supporting the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The USA lost six straight on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Led by Danish captain Thomas Beyonce, Team Europe reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States and reclaim the title.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had not played well for most of the tournament, watered his T-shot on the par-3 16th hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only 1 in 4 to score above 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Speith, the lowest ranked player on the European team, lost to Denmark's Thorbjørn Olsen in 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Polter, who played in what may have been his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia is Europe's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't this time.
It's been a bad year.
Thank you, Thomas, for electing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
"It's a team achievement, I'm happy I could help", Garcia said, excited about the European victory.
He handed over his country to John Ram, who defeated American golfer Tiger Woods in Sunday's singles 2 and 1.
"I am very proud to lose Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old John Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France, and his Ryder Cup record stands at 13-21-3.
This is a disproportionate statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles after only top-ranked Jack Nichols.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who all performed at a high standard, Team USA stumbled throughout the weekend.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
We put some pressure on Europe this morning.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players have played very well.
We'll turn around, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to respect them.
We didn't make the game.
Red stream update: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A brand new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the Pacheco Bloom situation has been seen in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - a sign of declining concentrations.
The Red River Bloom extends along about 130 miles of coastline from Pinellas in the north to Lee County in the south.
The patch can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but it's less noticeable than last week.
Red currents have also been reported in Pasco County.
Last week, moderate concentrations were reported in Pinellas County along and off the coast, low to high concentrations off the coast in Hillsborough County, high concentrations of ash in Manatee County, high concentrations on and off the coast in Sarasota County, moderate concentrations on and off the coast in Charlotte County, low concentrations on and off the coast in Lee County and low concentrations on and off the coast in Collier County.
Respiratory problems are still being reported from Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory problems have been reported from northwest Florida in the past week.
