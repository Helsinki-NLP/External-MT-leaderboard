The victory of right-wing populists in Austria, together, is 29 percent
The targeted weakening of both sides of the so-called big coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties led to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, with the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, seriously shaken.
By contrast, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Corinthian hejtman Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the SPÖ remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8% of the vote, but has lost 5.5% of the vote since the last election in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP lost by 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
It's the worst result of both of these big parties in the postwar history of Austria and especially for the people who called early elections, a literally disastrous result.
As early as early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the people had a significant lead in preferences to the SPÖ.
But the voters were clearly punished for letting the government collapse.
In the first few days of the vote, there was speculation that the party president and the current vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer, might resign.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party's presidency.
Such a development would likely facilitate the path to the increasingly likely exit from the election result, namely the resumption of the large SPÖ-ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the liberal (FPÖ) won a preliminary 18 percent and the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also expressed concerns about a repeat of 1999 when the people negotiated with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) on a joint government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
This is clearly the case for Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and envisages a return to Vienna for national politics.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but it lost slightly, falling from third to fifth place among Austria's political parties.
None of the other parties have apparently crossed the four percent threshold and failed to make it to parliament.
Relations with India could cool
If the problem of Czech scientists accused of illegal beetle harvesting in India could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said, the Czech-Indian relations would have cooled to a certain degree.
The minister said this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not resolved, then yes, then a certain cooling would occur", he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the hearing that the executive can hardly interfere in judicial matters.
However, it stated that in the case of Peter Schwacha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Dardgilling, under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved", the minister said.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and await sentencing on parole, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had spoken the same way during the hearing.
"He recommends an appeal to the higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him", the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can get involved is by providing 'competent legal support' to the convicted, the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have a vested interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a deep mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he said.
The answer to the question whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter was avoided.
"I've gotten enough promises", he merely stated.
The Czech Republic is judging the battle for the seabed
It will join a wallpaper electronic map showing Australia and the surrounding marine areas.
But he's not interested in the continent, but a little lost spot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and the seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the UN's 30th Ocean and Maritime Law Division.
His chief, the head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulák, follows the interpretation and occasionally completes it.
There's a lot of work and excitement.
The seabed hides a world that is still little known, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals, and other mineral resources can be found here, but also unknown living organisms that hold the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Bottom larger than the mainland
The coastal states have begun to vigorously seek new undersea territories today.
They are exercising their rights under the UN Convention, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is primarily an area of the so-called continental shelf, often extending several hundred kilometers from the country's coast.
It has exclusive rights under the Convention to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, behind the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its bottom, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often within two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission to define the external boundaries of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It's the result of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far considered five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far", adds Mikulka.
The world's reputation recently noted the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea holdings.
But he also gained New Zealand - the area of the seabed, which the commission admitted to him last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The future profits they will make from using the seabed will be, as they promise, priceless.
Other States shall submit their applications gradually.
They can do so for up to ten years after they ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, declared a "common heritage of mankind" by convention.
No state has an exclusive status here anymore.
Mining rights in this area are granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a Klondaik", says Director Mikul in a statement, adding that its "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regimes are contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other former Eastern Bloc countries within the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
It was granted, in 1991, under the Convention, the status of a 'pioneering investor', as were investors from a few other States.
He is authorized to mine in the Clarion Clipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is bent, it's some kind of subsea replica of the Tater.
"It can be mined in an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian division worker, Rober Sandev, brings one such concrete example.
It reminds me of a little potato, or, in a bit of a fantasy, the fabulous scheme that legend has brought Golem to life.
German special operations units were in the liberation of the hostages.
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany to deal with the hostage crisis and experts have arrived.
When the situation warmed, special forces were ready, but no deployment was made.
More details are being released about the release of 11 European tourists abducted in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German special forces were also involved in the rescue operation.
According to the Ministries, both the experts of the Federal Army and the members of the German police counter-terrorism group GSG9, the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Service and the Logistics experts of the Technical Hilfswerk were on the scene of the release.
But according to a statement from the two ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of forced release.
The Egyptian government has allegedly accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for the on-the-spot operation.
"That's not the luck", said a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight of their Egyptian escorts on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last minute, as were details of their release or possible ransom payment.
Rescues are already in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages is under the care of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of his release.
There is no information yet in Berlin on when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to Bild, all five tourists are to fly with special forces on one of the German Air Force's Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly rejected a $700 billion financial market bailout.
The Dow Jones has plunged sharply.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial markets bailout by a vote of 206 to 227.
Despite the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both sides, the majority did not find a program to ease the chaos in financial markets.
By a dramatic action, supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called for the MP to vote in favor, although, as he has said, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent, or 600 points.
The reason was the investors' fears that the state rescue package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index rose to a sharp decline after the failure was announced.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required for the programme to enter into force.
Travel agents report rising bookings
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, travel bookings for the coming months increased significantly from the previous year - even more than 30 percent during the winter season.
Despite the weak economic growth, the German desire to travel remains unchanged.
For winter bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, an increased number of reservations are already available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, the turnover for October was thus approximately 11% higher than in 2007.
The results are based on the figures of GfK, which evaluates booking data from 1200 German travel agents each month and interpolates them into the overall market.
This result included travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
The weak dollar rate is the main reason for the demand for travel to the United States, DRV said.
For these trips, the reservation increase is about a third.
In addition, the German targets are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
The first is the organized tours, said the DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising costs of energy and food, costs are 'easier to calculate for the client than for an individually organised holiday'.
Laepple explained that, among other things, consumers can save money by using early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
The number of reservations was also very good in the summer months, so that higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made some journey has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated ash, beer from tubals and prominent designers in costumes.
First time on a beer pitch.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV hostess, and she wears a custom-made tie.
I'm a black haired student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing brings us together: we're not even three minutes into the beer hall, and photographers are already throwing at us and flashcards are full of them - it's flattering, because I'm at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
Looks like my cheap carrot served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the coat was rather limited.
But as soon as we arrive at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's skirt or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The peculiar look at the banana-in-chocolate stand only harvests my veil.
One nun points out that I misunderstood her: "You're only free, in the middle of the virgin, married to the right, widowed behind".
They're hiding by shifting their ointments from the back to the left.
"All right", he says and laughs.
Others do not get too caught up in subtle flirting techniques and wear simple, plain-clothed hats that say "To drink to get dressed!" and stick their buttons on passersby's bare asses.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies named Bob, he's from England and he's also first to come to Oktoberfest.
He seems gorgeous, with an extended "ooooo".
He tells me that after he's had a little drink of his own.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is garbage can.
So Bob is one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as Bavaria calls it in public, free-wetting people.
Others don't have the luck to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, they run around the Oktoberfest grounds, crowding with paramedics who have to take care of poor drunkards.
The doctors always appear in packages - four wearing a covered cover from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to a beer hall: empty there, full back.
Whoever lies under the covering of this coffin of forgiveness is invisible.
"The only ones who can't keep up" is when one of the paramedics calls me in response and disappears into the crowd.
Police released the victim's name.
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving following the accident.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began its efforts to join the European Union, European powers wanted to penetrate deep into Turkey's borders.
On the eastern shore of the Bosporus, perhaps only 20 steps from Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Kon in the neo-Renaissance style.
So, that's what the tour guide will tell you.
The building sits perpendicular to the end of the platform with towers on each corner of the façade, with an unrecognizable view from some German provincial town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once you get inside the box office, you can't doubt the size of the business whose westernmost gateway was the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late to the game of empires, intended to realize its ambition to control the Middle East by using this railroad to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
British and colonial forces were advancing from Egypt and pushing the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there's bad news for Hydarpasha station too.
In 1917, an explosion of a munition train destroyed her refined roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually drilled and history has been circling it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and beyond to the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, where I was to meet one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a rollercoaster ride that recalled the old-world rhythms of the famous document The Night Post, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, with its well-known Islamist roots, the AKP represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
It has aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a state-of-the-art stone and metal building, purpose built in a developing suburb surrounded by half-built department stores and power shops, where middle managers in business suits -- men and women -- meet to do early morning shopping.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
The bag, the tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
Today, he must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But there will come a time", I asked, "when Turkey may have to decide?"
"Turkey", he said, "did not wish for such a decision to be made".
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here has said almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey is.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go along these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another mostly awake night, I thought of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who watched this building be built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to learn that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, in large part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited in the harbor for the ferry back across the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least at that time there was little doubt as to which continent should claim this fascinating land.
The memorable lives of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district's musical plan, he founded the year on the excellent youth choir Proteus.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, some of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to indulge in any music that was offered to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with an entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often overwhelming, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the passion for music that has remained completely unchanged throughout.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The storekeeper knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it!"
His tactical technique was perfectly clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor floral.
No matter where the musical standard was, it always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be fitted to a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well for two decades, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed in any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, he said, simply "drew a stick or two of salt around the world".
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to Oxford to study economic history and in 1950 became a research fellow at Houblon-Norman... while also studying for a BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's notes from the author of Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a dissertation on the British Rubber Industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as the publication British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and the University of New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham permanently and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was fascinated by the simplicity and the powerful charging of the audience, and the consideration and respect for the photographs.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resin can capture magical moments".
Honda is attacking for the second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will launch the second-generation Jazz.
While the predecessor of this one-seater vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is coupled with improved engines that increase driving comfort and fuel economy.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz's lines are very similar to the previous model from an aesthetic point of view, there have been many changes to this single-deck vehicle.
The new platform, larger dimensions and new engines are among the most important.
Before we even explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming to market six years after the first generation was launched.
So the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period of time to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a selling phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also this year in 2008.
In Japan alone, almost a million copies of the Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda, however, is aiming to increase sales in its new Jazz category.
In fact, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz cars, in 2009 it is estimated that there are 100,000 cars, which would represent a 17% increase in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6,7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the Jazz, the Spanish branch management expects to sell 2,000 units a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce the drop in sales in Spain.
The carmaker's management thus de facto expects to end the year with a total of 22 000 units sold, which is 4 000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1,8%, compared to 1,6%, last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a compact, 5.5-foot-long, 4.37-meter-long hybrid, which the Japanese company promises to sell worldwide at around 200,000 units per year.
As for the markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50 percent of Insigh will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percent will be split between the old continent and Japan.
Sales of the Honda Insight are expected to start in the first months of next year, once it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has expanded in all dimensions.
Its length increased to 3.9 metres (five inches more), its width to 1.69 metres (two inches more), and its beam to 2.5 metres, which means an extension of five centimetres.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and remains at 1.52 meters.
The increase in size also enlarged the interior.
This advantage was achieved, firstly, by using a new platform and, secondly, by placing a fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used on the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - also increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of luggage compartment in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are present in the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage compartment volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement, in addition to exterior features - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees versus 67 degrees for the first Jazz model.
The second-generation Honda Jazz has new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and delivers excellent drive system improvements while providing high torque at full engine speeds.
The first 1.2 litre engine has 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and a top torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had a 78-horsepower Jazz in the previous generation - has a power of 5.3 litres and a CO2 emission of 125 grams.
Unlike the previous engine, which had 83 horsepower in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
The Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has a combined power consumption of 5.4 litres and a CO2 emission of 128 grams.
"A bee car" prevents rain
For the advancement of accident protection technology, Nissan was inspired by nature, specifically bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the flying pattern of bees and prevents rainfall.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Center for Technical Advancement developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Science and Technology at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhira Doie, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Development of the brand, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four Nissan safety shield zones.
The robot is designed to enhance the collision prevention capability of this brand of vehicles.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
Most important, however, are the complex bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at angles greater than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its own personal space without stopping.
Engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder to create this visual function.
It records obstacles up to a distance of two metres in the 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor to immediately convert it to a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels at right or even greater angles to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all the maneuvers are completely instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and down, nor diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and the direction it is allowed to turn its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as in bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan used the rotation function to prevent the robot from hitting.
'The device only needs to process information every few seconds and behave accordingly.
It doesn't require the storage of information or the logical intuition of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
You may be surprised, but we're not talking about gigabytes or mega-bits in memory".
This is the first step in the development of new instantaneous crash prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars in 10 years.
The robot uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to integrate the unit into a GPS satellite navigation system that would guide the driver to the destination and avoid roadblocks.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be admitted that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having sufficient capital to give injections, is not lacking in inventiveness.
Facing a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages from banks with dubious solvency, it has created a popular online science game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
It wasn't a bad credit hotel or a messed up hotel.
The hotel and its receptionist in particular look blurred, so one, two, three times one should consider whether the time is right to apply for a loan.
And most of all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, even if not too detailed.
It's a site more suitable for young people than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, there's a dream room.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley Banking House announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, is joining the board Wednesday, issuing $9 billion to raise 21 percent of its capital.
A week after disclosing their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock for a single price of $25.25, representing a total recovery of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion in convertible securities that will provide it with 10% of the return and whose exchange rate is $31,25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire transaction would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of $29 or 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock, however, dropped 6.79 percent to $23.07 at around 5 p.m.
"This strategic merger presents an important opportunity on the way to accelerating Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status", explained John Mack, the group's CEO in the US.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to allow it to diversify its activities, but at the same time, it places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the largest Wall Street asset to take a much more cautious approach than before.
The terms of the deal, which were announced on Monday, show, among other things, that the deal has been amended over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan only announced it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago", explained Tojihide Mizuno, MUFG's CEO in Tokyo, "that our participation would be made up entirely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise the risks and also cover".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley securities 7% less than their carrying amount.
And the operation will result in a 20% reduction in earnings from the stock.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into common shares within a year if the latter are exchanged for a period of time at a price 50% above the exchange rate, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, the group spokesperson refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One eligibility ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has stated that he has "sensitively" reduced his balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group as its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against default risk associated with the debt have risen sharply.
These costs took the opposite course on Monday, but remained high, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch buy-out, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part, from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
To re-establish a republic around 21st century socialism.
This is a joint project between Hugo Chávez, the Venezuelan, Eva Morales, and Rafael Correy, the Ecuadorian.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put to a vote, following the example of his peers and friends, a new constitution.
And his mission is accomplished, because 64 percent of voters, according to official results covering 80 percent of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
To pass the Constitution, he had to get half the vote plus one.
Two polls conducted just outside the polling stations and a poll of NGOs predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, ranging from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa, by the way, claimed victory over his draft Constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has won the whole line", he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the governor's residence in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, took place quietly, concerned the text of the 444 points building "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over the economy by reserving to it the "development planning" of a country living primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, which is protected by Correou, elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms and will have the option of dissolving the House.
Correa has already announced that he will exercise this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, reinforces the principle of free health care and education that the President began to implement in a country of 13.9 million people where 50 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also counts on banning the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on using the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
Egyptian commanders have attacked the kidnappers of 11 tourists and their eight-man escort who were captured 10 days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were transported alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
In the morning, they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
The Rukoimim arrived at about 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken without the possibility of press release on a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, for medical examinations.
"They are completely healthy", and "no ransom has been paid to the hostages", said Egypt's Tourism Minister Zoheyr Garrana at the airport runway.
Since being captured on September 19th in a four-wheel drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of Aegyptous, safari organizer.
A senior Egyptian security official has suggested that 30 Special Forces personnel approaching the scene aboard two helicopters took off on the line during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shooting, half of the kidnappers were killed and the rest fled", said the source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He noted that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces "Flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is currently based, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence personnel, our special forces", he said without further specification.
He also denied that the ransom was being paid.
The Sudanese military said on the eve that it had seized a four-wheel drive vehicle on board the hijackers while on patrol, killing six, including a Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to the Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Unity Movement (SLA-U), which the said movement immediately rejected.
Letters - Most of the culture resort is quiet
The debate over cultural funding is filling newspaper pages with thumbnail headlines and is the subject of an ongoing election campaign.
The better.
But one aspect of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to launder the poor sums that are being given to small museums, archives, archaeological digs and national monuments that starve to death?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that they're neglecting their landmarks and historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that would actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors have a constitution that says that protecting cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage should be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all county organizations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, the Federation des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers affiliated with 211 societies of history, monuments, archives and genealogy are working to uncover history, preserve a collection of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a small fee.
Often these are the very companies that guard our monuments, the desperate protestors who are being driven by promoters and executives who release their bulldozers onto old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we finally gonna get the history and landmark stands?
The Benelux Governments of the State Bank of Fortis
The Benelux countries will help Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch bank that was the first in Europe to run into difficulties due to the widespread impact of the US mortgage market crisis, with a partial nationalisation: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital share in Hungary, with EUR 11.2 billion.
This was agreed at the highest level this weekend by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first bank in the euro area to enter a major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis, which has been raging for more than a year, and the decision taken in this case could be considered as a precedent in some respects.
Under the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy back almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets there.
The Bank will sell a part of its capital shares, in particular, the insurance assets purchased last year from ABN Amro, with absolute certainty.
Fortis' stock began to fall sharply last week, and by the second half of the week, the institution was already showing signs of a serious crisis.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to fail.
The company's stock dropped 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the stock price has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group's total market capitalisation is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's executives this is unrealistic.
The company's management blames the fall on Fortis' overseas market uncertainty over the US$700 billion package.
The stock has already risen slightly on Monday.
On Friday, the new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the bank's board.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has yet made a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
The bank's clients have not yet panicked and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
Fowl in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in the United States often reject the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with the applicant based on information about people buying medicines.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There is a data protection programme which applies the use of prescription data in any event with the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, or we entrust the fox to the chicken", says Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor prescription drugs.
Insurance companies make the insurance and sums paid in the event of an insurance event dependent on the health status of the beneficiaries and, if the risk is assessed as too high, they do not insure it.
Previously, they sent the people to medical examinations and only signed a contract when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick devised a much cheaper method: a pharmacy customer can easily find out from an ID number what medicines they've bought in the last year and a half, and the program itself can infer their condition and their condition.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medications, it indicates that he has practically uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately places him in the higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation, some of which also determine the risk coefficient, so that there is almost no work left in the insurance business apart from paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that lectra can be used for several purposes, some compounds are for example for migraine or heat stroke, but they are also effective against depression.
These are a significant risk-increasing factor from the point of view of commercial insurance, whereas the problems mentioned above are not.
For the purpose of data collection and processing, special companies have been set up which ask the patient for permission before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so, even though they have not punished them for their negligence so far.
Recently, some companies have also been working on lab tests that link to drug data to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to data, while controlling their use is becoming more difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness only applies to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
A bill that would give authorities the power to control even businesses specializing in data breaches is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: he therefore developed his programme so that the transfer of data is subject to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that he can barely refuse the permit in question, or the insurance companies will not sign a contract with him.
So chickens are a little bit dependent on fowl for goodwill.
The global menu of Marseilles
EU and India double their trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic was also the subject of the 9th Summit, alongside other, mainly global issues.
Today, the French-Indian summit will also be held, focusing on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a developing democratic power which should be given greater opportunity to speak on international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to find a common nominee in support of New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
The question was not even discussed at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, respectively, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double trade turnover to more than EUR 100 billion within five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the volume of trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In this respect, the 26 existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally harmonised, giving the air transport sector a green light in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the balance sheet, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth among the EU partners.
The Summit also focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism in all its forms, respectively, have been condemned by both sides and called for an urgent summit of the UN conference.
They also urged the end of the Dauhá round of trade negotiations, although both have a large share in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will continue its energy and climate programme, which is to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India has agreed, as has the need to reach a global agreement at the next year's climate conference to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
The two sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is on his way to the French capital today to conclude a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French firms will get the 20 billion euro warrant for the construction of India's nuclear reactors.
According to the agency's reports, the agreement is for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
A large participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international rights-exchange event.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries to take up 171,790 square metres of the exhibition with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as the guest of honour.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia)  on a 264-square-meter exhibition area.
A press meeting will follow in the Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the figures, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is declining, especially in view of children's and adult literature.
The plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago, was found.
The remains of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the Nevada desert, were found.
The wreckage was discovered on an upper plateau 3,000 feet above sea level in the Mammoth Lakes region of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson cleared up the remaining doubts: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we're sure it's exactly what Steve Fossett was flying in the day he disappeared", he told a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) reported that several hours after the wreckage was detected, an investigative team was dispatched to identify the plane: it was an exact Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has made history by collecting a long list of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world flight in an air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a plane and no landing.
Among his many records is a flight at 15,445 meters above the Andes, though with a pilot.
The look, the advertisement you didn't expect
One unusual SUV with an original design and well-defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last-born Glk of the compact star-house jeep that Mercedes-Benz has used to try to bring a barrage of new products to this sector.
It is precisely because of its unconventional processing that the communications that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk will be unexpected and unconventional and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will also open an unofficial way of communication thanks to a futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for an automotive brand.
The project of the maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main business class, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with special glasses to be delivered near the Corsa Como, the new SUV will be visible in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Actually, if you look at the picture, you'll get the impression that the car is going to be off the poster.
Then, using the innovative technology of Elumina8, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then fused again into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he be able to get the interest of future customers?
So we know who the Italian thugs are.
Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching the Nazionale Azzurra for years and which has, to be honest, never been in too much trouble.
She's never even met any of her opponent's fans.
The group's orientation is right.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Tresta and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three colour flags showing the cities of origin of the participants: they were removed on Saturday night to avoid recognition.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc made available 144 tickets to Italian fans for the match: all on name, so easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with a Dasl going on, no one who was forbidden to visit stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previously been in the stadium were denied tickets and banned from the game.
Now Viminale is waiting to read reports from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo at least five years to fans who were arrested or identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums but also all over Europe.
Our thugs, in short, don't step into any stadium anymore.
Good luck with that.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means more than 150 more are being added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not justify those who behave in this way", they confirm from Viminal.
So, "really open-eyed, especially for the national game on Wednesday in Lecce".
There's a small supporting force in Puglia.
There's an Osservatorio tomorrow, Tuesday, which Casms can count on, even a part of Aise, a secret service that's taking care of the problems in the stadiums.
"Church leader-leader and arms stretched during the Mother's hymn?
This is the thought of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a really unfortunate way), who for a few weeks was director of the Viminal Observatory (he got the position that was previously Francesco Tagliente's and then Felice Ferlizzi's).
Mazzilli was previously a quistor in Trest, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It's true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it's not a crime to celebrate a leader, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is shameful.
"I'm not a sociologist", adds the Observer's first-rate. "Crimes are attributed to the country where they occur.
So far, this group has been confined, so now we're going to take a closer look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistling in Mommy's anthem: it's not a crime either, but if you will, it's rude... "
