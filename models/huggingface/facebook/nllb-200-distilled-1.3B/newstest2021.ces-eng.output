The rookie helped Trabzonspor to second place, and the Shkoda was right.
Defender Filip Novak helped Trabzonspor to the Turkish league title with a goal in the final round.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor's stadium and kept third place Besiktas.
Milan's Škoda striker scored his tenth goal for Rizespor after moving from Slavonia in January, and they were saved even though they lost 3-3 at Fenerbahce.
The rookie has proven his excellent defensive productivity with his seventh goal of the season.
In the 63rd minute, Kayserispor's goalkeeper just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer hit the ball into the net from the corner.
The hosts managed to draw five minutes to go, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the set-up won the game by successfully ending the break four to one.
The damage in the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce made after the solo to 1:1.
Rizespor did not stay in the tie for long, but he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of his opponents, he remained three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end with the champion Basaksehir's duel on Sunday at Kasimpasa Stadium.
The well-concealed cave of a hermit in the woods near Novi Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lužské Mountains, near Novi Bor in Českolipsko, in the forests through which the Count's Way led, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and man-made.
And we're going to go after that man-made thing.
The place is called the Cave of the Hermit.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely a hiding chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock shelter and accessed by stairs from above.
But it's hardly visible until the last minute.
The narrow steps leading to a rock gallery, where you enter the rock, reveal it.
Although the chamber appears to be quite far from human habitation, at the time of its formation it may have been on a high plateau where today is a forest, a field.
"The fact that the building has no windows and no frying pan in its traditional location clearly shows that no hermit could have survived the winter here", explains historian Kamil Podroužek of the Faculty of Philosophy of St. John Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-room building has only a stone bench at the back, apparently for storing dishes.
"I see it as a storage room for some food or produce from the field", adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of tools on the cave walls.
Breaking the sandstone with a spear was quick and easy for the novice.
All that was needed was to use the appropriate steam and gradually break the sandstone.
The length of the trail and the cutting method can be used to give a general idea of the period of the cave's formation.
According to the historian, it's probably late 18th century.
The cave is open to the public and due to the disorder that occurs in it, people sometimes sleep there nowadays.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and are intrigued by the stream below and the nearby county road, you will surely find a path down as well.
And on your way out of the woods, you might be taken by the nearby Crow Rock.
Jockey Minarick is in a deep sleep after a severe fall in Germany.
"Philip is in the best hands now.
The Institute is equipped for such cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This makes my situation and my care for Finja much easier", Minařik's wife Katja said.
"Everyone is doing their best, but Philip needs time to recover.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who's ever been in a head trauma or a sleep-induced trauma situation knows that can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient and give him time now", said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
A call for financial support for injured Minarik was also made on Twitter by star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, equalling the record of Lester Piggott.
Almost 70,000 euros have been raised on Gofundme to date.
The target is EUR 100 000 (CZK 2.6 million).
The video referee took Sassuolo's football players four goals, they lost 0-2.
Sassuolo's players were hit four times in the opponent's goal in Saturday's game in Naples, but they eventually had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
Not one of their goals was conceded by the referee after consulting the video for the offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record breaking technology setback, the most ever for a team in the history of VAR.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than road radar and punished it like no other team.
New technology is breaking records", wrote the Gazzetta dello Sport in a commentary.
"Festival of unrecognized Sassuol goals.
Never before has the VAR been so strict on one team", added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the eighth minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have tied.
But the goal of Filip Djuricic was not recognized after the video referee intervened due to offside.
For the same reason, Djuricic's next strike and Francesco Caputo and Domenica Berardi's hits gradually failed.
The home side, on the other hand, added another goal.
Electric cars are setting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they've been charging the most in history.
"The growth was driven by both the 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend towards more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations", said Tomáš Chmelík, Head of the Clean Technologies Department at CEZ.
Other major players are also reported to have a market share, such as PRE and E.ON, electric car manufacturer Tesla, but also supermarkets Bill and Lidl.
The operators of conventional filling stations are represented by MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We only started building our electric mobility network last year", explained company spokesperson Jana Jusková.
However, the editors of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by the company.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the exact amount of the aid.
That's equivalent to a range of about 60 miles for a smaller electric car.
If we leave out the small pumps down to 1 kWh, it takes an average of two and a half hours to charge.
The vast majority of the refuelling was then carried out at a free rate.
If motorists were paying for a ride, their typical cost was about $400.
Electric mobility is particularly strong in the capital.
The five most-used charging stations of ČEZ are all located in Prague, which are also popular in whole regional cities.
Olomouc then leads the way between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is shown by remote border stations, such as Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused all day.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new electric cars were added.
In a large-scale survey of the Czech Daily, eight percent of readers said they would consider buying an electric car for their family.
However, only one third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organisers, the government's steps so far in protecting and restoring the Czech landscape and solving the climate crisis are insufficient, and speakers called on the state to take a more aggressive approach.
The event, entitled Last Drop, was attended by representatives of large organisations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace and the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have people here, for example, who have long been against the expansion of the Turów mountain, there are people here who are against the gravel extraction at the Hungarian Strait, there are people here who are against the construction of pointless dams", said Marika Wolf, the organizer.
She said the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan to contain water in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system to promote sustainable agriculture and a rapid shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"Government is supposed to protect the interests of the people, not ruthless and devastating business", she said.
A petition stand was set up on Malostranský náměstí, calling on Czech state officials to work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring the Czech soil and landscape.
People in attendance were carrying banners with slogans such as "End of rapeseed sludge" or "Less coal, more peat".
Jan Škoda from the association Za vodu za lidi, which is protesting against the plan to mine gravel in Hodonín, has arrived in Prague from South Moravia.
"It threatens the drinking water supply for 140,000 people", he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most productive source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
He said the planned gravel extraction is only about 500 meters from the wells and that the water quality is certain to be compromised.
He came from the village of Valeč to Karlovy Vary as a so-called agro-ecological farmer.
He pointed to the wealth of small farms that do not marry for yields and profits and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a normal way, and they do not cause such devastation to the countryside and the environment", he said.
Three people died when a plane crashed into a house in Germany.
Three people were killed and two others injured when an ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in western Germany today.
Local emergency services have reported that two crew members and a resident of the home are believed to be among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five apartment units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already brought the flames under control.
Deputy fire chief Robert Meyboom said both crew members were believed to have died.
The third victim is a woman who lived in the house, according to police.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper, citing Mayor Wesel, reported that the mother was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from her apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the crash site, apparently to act as a landing brake.
Police believe it came from a downed plane.
There was room for two on the plane.
The plane took off from an airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper reported that the plane collided with a hot-air balloon before it crashed, citing eyewitnesses.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ cited other witnesses as saying the plane broke apart in mid-air before impacting the ground.
The Czech savings bank on Saturday incorrectly charged some card payments twice.
She's already fixed the bug.
Czech savings bank mistakenly charged some of its customers twice on Saturday afternoon for card payments.
According to bank spokesman Lukas Kropik, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The savings company has already fixed the mistake and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double-billing of card payments were reported by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"Just last night we updated the system and all these double payments were immediately returned to the clients.
At the moment everything is working without problems", said Kropík on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of customers whose credit card payments were deducted twice is unknown to the bank's spokesman, who estimated that the number was less than a thousand transactions.
The cause of the problems is being investigated by the savings bank.
"It could be a combination of factors", said Droppik.
The Czech savings bank is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
By the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojtěch will introduce a three-stage coronavirus alert system on Monday.
'They will be gradually extended to the regional level according to the strength of community dissemination.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics", Vojtěch told ČT.
The so-called traffic lights will be green, orange or red, depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of the individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would currently have the orange color and Prague would approach it.
The map will also show individual measures for regional health stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to tackle this at the level of the regions, because the situation is not uniform", Vojtěch said.
The Aquarius and the Caroline
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Caroline fall in love, it's not easy for them.
Jonas is defended in love by his father, the rude waterman Hastrbuch, while Caroline has no idea that her dear Jonas is not human.
Fortunately, there's a young Libor who will do anything to protect the village, and especially Caroline, from that water-badger.
What's the use of him scheming and lying?
Especially when he can get Caroline to reject Jonah and prefer him to the brave Libor.
Soon, everyone in the village knows who is responsible for the drowning of the Midnight Pot, the spoiled flour, the mill fire, and other robberies.
Angry villagers organize a hunt for the waterman, and the waterman's implacable curse falls on Jonah's head.
And now, little soul of Konvich's, Caroline, you can go!
How do we soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and break his curse?
The story was filmed in September 2010 in the Czech Television studios and in the exteriors at the Brzina pond, in Obděnice on Sedlčansko and in the beautiful environment of the historic mill in Hoslovice.
The bridge motorway is launching a new e-shop
The new e-shop is available on the website of the Autodrome de Brest.
It also offers free and test tickets for car and motorcycle trips on a large racetrack, which were previously only possible in person at the race track staff in the starting tower.
'We have improved the e-shop to make it user-friendly and at the same time we have expanded the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
We also have a bonus of 1,000 crowns for our customers on all our safe driving courses.
The discount coupon can be found on the website www.autodrom-most.cz", explained Jana Svobodová, commercial and marketing director of AUTODROM MOST.
The Commission notes that the e-shop website is now clear and easy to navigate for the customer.
"The e-shop visitor chooses the targeted focus on the bar.
For example, sports, safe or sporty driving courses, training, experience programmes, gift items, gift vouchers, activities for children and more", the director said.
Among the innovations in the products and services offered by the e-shop are, for example, the Racing Legends shirt with the surprise, the motorway, the reduced visibility safe driving course, advertising and gift items of the domestic professional racing team Buggyra Racing or the Engelmuller gloves from the limited edition watch manufacturer BOHEMATIC, created to celebrate the historic victory at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1949.
"The offer is very varied, the customer can choose from more than 200 items", said Jana Svobodová.
When paying for the product or service chosen, the customer can choose one of four options.
Payment by advance (bank transfer), direct debit, cash on delivery or online via a payment gateway.
Most have a mild course, with only 3 percent of those infected needing to be hospitalized.
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of the coronavirus, or the summer sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infection wards in hospitals are half empty, even though the number of infected is rising.
"The situation today is completely different from April, and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalizations", Health Minister Adam Vojtěch confirmed.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic reached its peak, everyone wore masks, the army took the collection, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfectants for the year ahead.
Yet ten people died every day.
Now, daily increases in the number of cases are higher, but at most two people die every day from COVID-19.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected per capita, similar figures are already recorded in Jihlava due to an outbreak at the local Alzheimer's Center, where 57 people have been infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly has been closed by the sanitation in Černožice on Královéhradeck.
The disease was confirmed by tests on one of the nurses.
"We're moving, we're restricting our movement, we've got all the hygiene measures", says Martin Schánel, the manager of the nursing home.
He says none of the clients at the home have symptoms of the disease yet.
The field tests will begin tomorrow and then the hygienists will decide on the next steps.
Hospitals are responding to the rising number of cases.
The Brno Cancer Institute today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance that will detect if people are wearing masks when they enter.
The record is held by South Bohemian hygienists, who recorded 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of a money-making company.
A total of 131 cases were reported on Saturday - half of Friday's total - but fewer tests were conducted over the weekend.
Debutant to champion!
Van den Bergh finished the story, Anderson was swept away.
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, also performed well against the player who won the second most prestigious PDC event in 2018.
The match started with a draw, with the break coming at 8:7 for the Belgian archer.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-arrow leg and has been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his play, and the far more experienced Flying Scot had a hard time getting to the doubles.
The way the Dream Maker had him in his fist is also shown by the fact that the distraught Anderson didn't hit his first home run until the 24th.
Plus, the young Belgian was doing great with his high-end checkouts.
He last lost in the 11th league, but in a bad condition he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
By the end of the match, Anderson was showing a huge amount of frustration.
He was simply throwing arrows, and his triumphant opponent was acting with absolute sovereignty.
Van den Bergh turned the first of his three darts matches into what he called his big dream.
The prize, named after Phil Taylor, is all the more valuable to the Belgian archer because it's his first major title.
It still holds true that the last player to beat van den Berg is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes, charges were dropped for the cathedral fire, a man confessed
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, severely damaging the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroying the organ.
The suspected arson investigation was investigated because the fire spread through the temple from three different locations.
Police also found no signs of forced entry at the entrances.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without prosecution.
Now, the prosecution has announced that based on new evidence, a man was re-arrested on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
If convicted, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets his actions and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde reported.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present the "Semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to act as a pandemic plan, the absence of which has faced criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"They will be gradual according to the strength of the community spread", the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium orange level.
The system is designed as regional because the situation varies significantly between regions, he added.
The Ministry worked with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) on the system.
The Minister also noted that the Ministry of Health had not yet decided on the measures to be taken.
The Minister of the Interior, Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), called for the creation of an epidemiological plan in the Prima Partie television program, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
Daily increases in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic have been increasing in recent days, although the number of hospitalizations remains low.
The chief commented that there was nothing serious going on and there was no need to talk about declaring a state of emergency or re-convening the crisis team.
The government has reintroduced the mandatory wearing of masks at indoor events for more than 100 people in view of the increasing number of infected since Saturday across the Czech Republic.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now 1,000 people.
The government's policy of not being clear until the last minute about what measures will be put in place and when they will be announced has been criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should instead create a sense of security and reverse the confusion", said Senator Marek Hilsher in Questions.
Measures can already vary by region, for example in Prague, from Sunday, masks will be compulsory in non-residential medical facilities, such as pharmacies or doctor's waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies was introduced from Friday in the Liberec and Ústec regions.
In the Highlands of Jihlavsk, masks are required in indoor public spaces, in public health facilities and in medical facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, the anti-epidemic measures were relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian Region and Kutnohorsko.
The Czech government also approved a so-called European traffic light in early June, which distinguishes the degree of risk of infection in different European countries and accordingly modifies the rules for entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In low- and medium-risk countries, authorities will not require negative coronavirus tests from Czech citizens from 15 June or mandate quarantine instead.
They're mandatory when Czechs come back from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category.
The tech party at Benešovsk continues.
He's playing at a third capacity, supposed to be done by noon.
The Technoparty at the Head's Lhota in Benešovsk continues on Sunday evening.
It still plays a third of the original 12 musical systems.
According to the evening police estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the initial rough estimates spoke of 300, in the morning there were 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the tech party was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time some of the music systems actually went silent.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
The music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect that the music systems will be gradually disconnected and dismantled", Nováková said.
"Police continue to rigorously check outgoing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving,' she added.
Dozens of police officers are supervising the operation, foreign police, traffic and police are on the scene, and dog handlers and service dogs are also on standby.
"During the day, police inspected 470 people moving around the event site and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breath tests, six of whom were behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol", Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of whom tested positive.
The officers also handled 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the participants of the Techno Party, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not decreased, the police would have intervened.
In the Prime Party television program, the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this.
But the number of participants dropped below 1,000, so the police decided that no intervention was necessary, and neither the sanitation station nor the health ministry asked for it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the technoparty had spread to surrounding land, whose owners had not agreed to use it for technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation.
Tech fans on the meadow near the Headlocked Loth arrived Friday night.
Police were originally on Friday patrolling a meadow in Blazima, Benešovsk, where a tech party was held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Glaváček's Lhota, where the technicians finally really got together.
Novak says no one came to the Bliss.
The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in the Iron Road.
A snake bit a girl in the leg, a 2010 year old, who was brought to the rescue service's base by her parents", regional spokeswoman for the rescue service, Maria Svobodová, told Denik.
The snake is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the Šumava that these animals are found in greater numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, these animals pose no real danger.
The chances of a snake biting you are not very high, it is afraid of normal contact.
And if it has room to do so, it likes to crawl away at a loud hiss.
They only attack when they feel very threatened - for example, if you step on them by mistake.
Its bite is not a tragedy either, for its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill humans.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weak organism or is allergic.
The risk of danger is therefore mainly for children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"A person may feel vomit, sweat, have a fever, thirst, stomach pain and diarrhea after a bite, and even anaphylactic shock may occur in weakened individuals, especially allergic ones", Miriam Gred of Klatov Hospital told Denik.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
He poured wine on the policewoman and threw dishes at her.
After 11:00 p.m., a task force entered the apartment and arrested the man.
The babies were immediately taken into the care of paramedics, said Markéta Janovská, a spokeswoman for the regional police.
The man refused to cooperate with the police, throwing dishes, knives, or pouring wine out of the window at the police negotiator.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with a child in his arms.
One time he even climbed up the window sill by himself, where he frowned.
Police are still investigating the man.
He's not releasing any more information yet.
Stosur will prefer her daughter before the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not play this year in the coronavirus-affected season.
The 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, but doesn't want to end her career yet.
She plans to return to the court next year, and believes that with her family and daughter, she will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay home, spend time with my family, be at all the little milestones our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it", the former world number one in fours said on the Australian federation's website.
The WTA Tour will resume its season break in March with a relay tournament in Palermo on August 3.
Sapa Market: Raids uncover meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the site was carrying 1,320 quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the sanatorium", the State Veterinary Administration said.
The inspection of the live fish stand then revealed that the seller did not have proof of origin and was not registered to sell live fish.
The trunk is considered to be a veterinary problem in the long term.
For example, last fall, veterinarians in this country discovered illegal food sales, with almost half a ton of unlabeled food without origin documents.
For most of them, the expiry date could not be determined, some products had expired and were spoiled.
The expiry date of 5 kg of squid was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers at the market area seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin calls Zelensky before the ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbas, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect at midnight.
According to a Kremlin statement, Putin has, among other things, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelenskyy had called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by Ukrainian and Russian negotiators with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday, is to be "complete and general" and is to pave the way for the further provisions of the peace agreements to be implemented.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections violates the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's parliament last week decided that the upcoming local elections will not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreements provide for Kiev to regain control of the border of the Ukrainian territories occupied by the separatists with Russia after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
According to the Union Agency, Zelensky's office said that the two leaders agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas and the need to implement further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of fighting or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreements helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in occasional gunfire and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed over 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbass his priority, but there has been no major breakthrough in the negotiations so far.
The unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykel, the seven-man was mastered by Novotná
Defender of the last two titles Doležal did not get to the end of the Saturday program the 400, Kopecký on Sunday did not jump the base in the pole.
The team was long dominated by Latvian Reinis Kregers, who trained in the group of coach Josef Karas, but resigned after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor Czech Republic so far, this time he was the only decathlete who crossed the seven-thousand mark.
Other medals were won by Vilém Strásský and Petr Urbánek.
The rally after the competition reminded of the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelot and George Sikora.
"It's a shame the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start it, because then the results would look completely different.
But the title tastes really good, and I appreciate the fact that I put the personality about a foot away.
Then I was pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed with the disc, I was below average", he admitted on the union Facebook.
The first day of the seven-bouts was won by more than 100 points by Katerina Cachová, despite suffering from an injured ankle on her kick leg.
However, in the distance sector, she then recorded only 570 cm, did not throw a spear 40 meters and did not enter the final eight.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Katerina Dvořáková.
She was above all a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wish it was around 630.
Yesterday I started to feel a little sore, but I'm very happy that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all", Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio-LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promising eco-friendly operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular because of its substantially lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given its significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre driven.
Like petrol and diesel, it has its own eco-friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market the year before and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days we have received the first 15 tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our filling stations in combination with conventional fossil LPG", says the association quoting Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
Bio-LPG, however, cannot be considered as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically similar to the conventional LPG that many motorists now fill their cars with.
Therefore, both versions can be mixed at will.
"The only difference from conventional LPG is the way it is produced", says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also one of the major advantages of bio-LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store and the distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product of the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, conventional LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining and partly by separation in natural gas production.
The result is that, depending on the production technology and source, running a car on bio-LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than running on oil-based LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, this is not the case for CO2 emissions from the car's exhaust, but for the ecology of fuel production, the so-called well-to-tank part.
One of the largest producers of bio-LPG currently includes the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP CM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the association's estimates, there are about 170 thousand LPG-powered vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment gives a slightly higher figure, about 200 thousand, in the NAP ČM.
According to the Ministry of Transport statistics, almost 6,000 cars were converted to LPG last year alone.
The Czech Republic has around 950 LPG filling stations operated by different operators.
The chief has revised the number of infected, the number has fallen by 1,775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) has ordered the ministry to revise the coronavirus infection numbers.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number of cases dropped to 3,479 from 5,254 on Saturday afternoon, down 1,775 from Sunday.
The Czech Republic has 3422 patients at present.
"Behind the jump in the number of cured patients is a revision of data that has not been updated recently by health professionals", said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had been infected with the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had sadly died from Covid-19.
Mobile voting units or correspondence voting.
A political scientist and a sociologist were looking for options for a pandemic.
In order for people in quarantine due to coronavirus to vote in the October regional and senate elections, the vice-premier and minister of the interior, Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), said a change in the law was needed.
Parliament could debate it in August or September in an accelerated fashion.
He said it on Sunday on Prime TV's Party.
He wants to discuss a possible solution with the representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry on Tuesday.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law", Hamáček said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the legal framework.
But the minister said that the law would need to be amended to prohibit people in quarantine from voting due to health reasons.
The prohibition on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop on OVM said that the option of a correspondence election had been delayed since 2004.
The current bill, which is in the Chamber, also envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers that ANO or ČSSD's concerns (because, according to experience from abroad, this would rather replace other types of parties) about the correspondence election are overstated.
He is personally opposed to the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States that are eligible for the EU Ecofin Programme.
The main thing is to be ready for the 2021 parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether abroad or in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
They also see the electoral units mentioned above or perhaps the possibility of representative voting within the family.
He added that there is a lesson to be learned from how similar situations - elections during the coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland, or France.
Various types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries around the world this year due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Protests in Bucharest: Protesters throw pig ears at government building
Protesters against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet have thrown pig ears at the government building.
This was the latest in a series of protests against "mafia-style rule" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide lockout on Wednesday, DPA reports.
Today's protest, which has been held for 18 consecutive days, was less attended than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
By 8:00 p.m., about 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Protesters outside the government building staged a theatrical scene, symbolically locking Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two presidential advisers, Rumen Radev, a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests Nikolai Khazigenov said on public radio today that a "peak of escalation" is coming on Wednesday in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and a blockade across the country".
He repeated the demand for Borisov and his government to resign, as well as calling early elections.
The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt implementing acts laying down the rules for the application of this Regulation.
Borisov has previously said he has no intention of resigning.
He explained this, inter alia, by the need to put Bulgaria through the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday, he replaced five members of his government team, though the resignation did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government suspended a vote of no confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mikhailovich doesn 't want to play games without spectators anymore .
Bologna coach Siniša Mihajlovic has had enough of League games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we're running here right now is not football.
I'm sick of these no-show matches.
It's a sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
Those matches are worse than training.
It's terrible to play like this and I think I'm not the only one who thinks that", said Mihajlović before today's game against Lecce.
After the coronavirus pause, Serie A games follow in quick succession, and even though they're played in the evening, their actors are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in the blazing heat.
Under these conditions, you don't know what the teams are like.
I'm sorry this season is over.
These measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that by September the fans will be back", said the coach, who has also managed Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
This season is also unusual for Mikhailovich because he missed four months on the bench for treatment for leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the suspension of the league and everything else, our team has managed to move to a higher level.
We want to keep growing and to do that we need the players to be mentally stronger", he said.
We've become a target of cyber attacks by foreign countries, Iran says
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported at a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises.
Some Iranian officials have said that a fire that broke out this month at the Natanz underground nuclear facility could have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a series of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian media reported that Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure is facing "thousands of cyber attacks" every day.
He added that the phenomenon is not new and that most of them can be averted.
In recent months, Mousavi said, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded, with analysis showing that "certain governments and groups" were behind them.
He did not provide any details on the possible culprits, Reuters reported.
Musavi also said that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by Iran's state news agency IRNA this month suggested that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, may be behind recent incidents.
But none of these countries were directly blamed for the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-standing tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
Iran fired a series of missiles into American bases in Iraq on January 8.
The US only withdrew its acknowledgment that dozens of American troops were wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended the production shutdown, now until May 25th.
Cologne-based carmaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended its production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
The production lines should be restarted on Monday, May 25th morning.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the automaker.
Production has been halted due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18th.
The company originally planned to reopen it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the strike is, according to Paroubka, the closed borders and the closed dealerships, so no one can sell cars.
According to Paroubke, the company will start with 100% production, two shifts.
The coronavirus has affected key markets for the company, such as Italy, the UK and Spain.
Mayor Michael Kaspar (Cologne Change) said that the production shutdown at TPCA is not a sign of life in the city.
"From the beginning, it was familiar, the city was empty.
But the streets are filling up, especially since Monday, when it got a lot looser.
So the city is full", said Kaspar.
He says there are no complications with the foreign workers who stayed in the dormitories.
"We had almost no problems to solve in those two months", Kaspar said.
For example, the Škoda Auto, which also stopped production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday 27 April at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants are operating at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production at Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
In the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third, night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time since the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs around 2500 people and is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in Cologne.
Cancer kills bride shortly after wedding, leaves a message for family
For more than two years Gemma Sisson battled a malignant cancer, and when she seemed to have defeated it, the disease returned.
A 39-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a bed in a hospice, where she was still able to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she died of her illness.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved to build up her body.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for over 16 years, they traveled to competitions around the world.
A 39-year-old woman exercised and lived a healthy life, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started a grueling treatment, radiation therapy, in the hope of getting better.
After months of treatment, Gemma did seem to have conquered the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time to the spine.
The British daily Daily Mirror reports that the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a 10-hour spinal surgery and then resumed drastic treatment.
Of course, it was all for nothing.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, the doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the beautiful blonde finally decided to enter a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged for her to marry her lover Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post appeared on her social media account that Gema had written for her family.
"If this is published, it means I've finally died after weeks of too long a struggle.
Although it will be heartbreaking to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky enough for being by my side the whole time and giving me so much love and support during that terrible time", she wrote on social media, saying that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social media followers", she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweaty dates, mushroom charms and pexeso
For 100 crowns, he gets a passing pocket piece mostly by aspiring Czech artists.
They create images and other work directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit in a size of eight and a half by five and a half centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The package always contains the curator's text about the artist and then the work itself", said Petra Wižová, the curator of the project.
Artmat works on the principle of chance.
The buyer may be surprised at the artwork he receives.
He may now become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Stoplová or miniatures by Teresa Bonaventure, which can also be sent.
Punx 23 artist in collaboration with Dora Dutková prepared a pexeso associated with a walk in Prague.
The cards must be matched to the home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket-sized packages of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a trident and a witch card, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritistka.
Healthcare salaries will go up by a maximum of five percent next year.
A bigger raise is unrealistic, according to Vojtěch.
Salaries in healthcare could rise by up to five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) said in Questions from Václav Moravce on Czech television.
He finds the union demand for a 15 percent raise unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
He says the hospital has their supplies now.
"I think the increase (in wages) could be somewhere in the five percent range", the minister said.
He said the current situation should be reflected, as since March, the government has intervened in the selection of coronavirus pandemic insurance and government regulations against its spread.
Insurance revenues were down at the time.
"A 15% raise seems unrealistic at this point", Vojtěch said.
The average monthly salary of an acute-care physician in the hospital bed, according to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS), is likely to reach 88,312 CZK this year, and of a nurse 47,498 CZK.
The difference between the salaries of nurses in state hospitals and those of other nurses will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data from the NIC also show that the decline in nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was 34 125 crowns in 2019, according to the data of the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum of a 10 percent raise for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticise the long-standing significant difference between the salaries of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow pay tables, and contractual salaries in city, county or private hospitals.
They therefore also call for uniform pay scales for healthcare workers.
The difference between nurses and nurses this year will be up to seven thousand crowns a month.
But for doctors, for example, wages rose faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Association, Roman Šmucler, trade unions should be aware of the current situation.
The House of Representatives recently approved an increase in the state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns this year due to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, of which 1.75 billion is to go to salaries of healthcare workers in hospitals and social services.
The board of health care providers, according to Schmucker, is against a blanket pay rise next year.
The Commission considers that the compensation should be decided by the hospitals and healthcare facilities themselves and that the additional money should be paid to them through the compensation order.
The Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have any protective medical devices in its possession.
He's waiting for the competition to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers around the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought out.
He said the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
The smart quarantine that's taking place could be taken over by the military.
We're ready, they're calling.
"The smart quarantine works, there's room for improvement, of course.
We're gonna discuss the night with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should not be in charge again", the prime minister said on his Facebook show Hello People on Sunday.
He argued that IT systems and toilets were not sufficiently connected and that they had to gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Ministry of Defense spokesman Jan Pejšek told the Czech Republic's parliament that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
He says the army is ready for this move.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25th.
Until then, the clever quarantine was run by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy prime minister Roman Prymula.
The project was criticised by the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
He also mentioned that the army might take him back.
The government's IT and digitalization commissioner Vladimir Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, has previously admitted to shortcomings.
"The system works, but it's still being worked on.
For 20 years, it was created independently and non-systematically, now we're trying to consolidate it in a matter of months.
It's not a jet.
The people behind the march, the poor in hygiene, they're adapting the new systems and actually picking up on the mistakes", he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again because he does not want to "fuck up politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to "keep out of politics", he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO movement's presidency, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the votes.
Macura originally only wanted to be in office for four years.
"I said to myself that I would last one term and with my business experience I could turn this place upside down and get it back on its feet", he told Respektu.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent to run for a second term.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to mess with politics", added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a hard-nosed introvert who doesn't like frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation for some time about Macur's possible end in the YES movement.
Server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities, ANO supported Zemanov's opponent, Jiří Drahos, in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel I can make a difference in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight and that no one is messing with me, I have no immediate motive to quit", Respektu said.
Fifty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was, among other things, the CEO of the pharmaceutical manufacturer Walmark.
He's also been on the boards of other companies.
Uber returns to Brno with its ride-hailing service
Uber, which provides transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of the change in the law, said on Thursday in a press statement Brno Transport Councilman Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Taxi drivers in Brno protested Uber, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as being labelled as a taxi or a meter.
However, the amendment of the law changed the conditions for the operation of both conventional and alternative taxis from July.
Mr. Kratochvil has been in several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
'On the basis of these, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city has been made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits", Kratochvíl said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
He was protested by taxi drivers for not labeling vehicles as taxis or missing a meter.
The court issued a restraining order banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to the later court rulings, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
Now he's coming back under a change in the law.
Since July, it has been easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid for exclusively via mobile applications, in addition to traditional taxis with lights and a meter.
Too big a party in Brno: a flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew off the fourth floor of an apartment building in Brno on Saturday evening and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian was following him at that moment, and he immediately called the police.
Upon arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrolman noticed an open window with a chair still underneath and several cans and cigarettes beside it.
"The noise coming from the fourth-floor room indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The officers went out into the hallway to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between 26 and 29, for explanations", said police spokesman Jakub Ghanem.
The request to appeal Rafaje will discuss Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss on Monday with the coalition Social Democrats the request for the proposal to dismiss the head of the Antitrust Authority (OAO) Peter Rafaj.
Non-profit organizations called for a meeting of the government's anti-corruption council and the Ústecký kraj to appeal against Rafaje.
The Social Democrats say a change of government is in order.
According to the information of the Czech Television, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term expires in the middle of next year, and he cannot be reappointed for a third term.
His dismissal is the responsibility of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústecké kraj.
The reason is, among other things, Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister declined to comment on the request, saying he would look into the materials and that the government parties would seek "some opinion".
He also stated that he had not yet discussed the challenge with the president, and that he had no meeting with him in the near future.
According to the statement of the SCC, there is no reason to appeal, because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz last week wrote that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with captain Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were linked, among other things, to the decision to tender the controversial new eight-billion-dollar Zlín hospital project that Čunek is strongly promoting.
The man admitted to meeting, saying they were discussing his "senate activities".
That's how Rafa's talking too.
The Ust-Kashmir District Council called on the government to dismiss Rafaje at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the Authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the measures taken by the GOI in the course of the investigation.
Last March, the police intervened at the Antitrust Office over a toll collection tender.
In June this year, the Aktuálně.cz server pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments registered to the company of influential behind-the-scenes player of ČSSD Alexander Čuba.
But the 3.5 million deposit for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
The President of the Social Democracy Party appointed Rafaj as Chairman of the Competition Authority on 9 July 2009 for a second term of office.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year term will expire.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may remove the Chairman of the Board on the proposal of the Government.
He may be removed only if he has not been in office for more than six months or if he seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
The staff at the Blen Library collapsed in the heat.
It'll help with the air conditioning.
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"This is good news for me.
My three children and I go to the library in downtown Blansko regularly.
But during the warm months, it was practically impossible to survive.
It was hot and bad air.
The ventilation didn't help.
That is why I like air conditioning", said one of the readers, Petr Novotný.
According to library director Lukas Dlapka, temperatures in the building often reached over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
The south wall of the building is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"The curvature of the building also provides the sunlight for much of the day.
At the same time, ventilation of individual rooms is a major problem because windows must be closed at night for safety reasons.
"It's often 30 degrees in the library in the morning", Dlapa said.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And upstairs, the exhibition room and the head office.
The children's ward, located under the roof of the building, was also uncomfortable.
"Librarians have collapsed and become unfit for work on several occasions.
The problem also regularly arose in the lecture halls, which are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe", noted Dlapa.
Originally, the city wanted to put air conditioning in all library rooms this year.
It'll end up being three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, air conditioning will only be available in the most problematic areas.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Then there is the cultural room and the children's department on the upper floor", said Jiří Svoboda from the investment department in Blen.
He added that in the first phase, workers installed air conditioning and electrical equipment in the buildings last fall.
It's about $360,000.
The city library Blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
That's about 900 in 15 years.
The Chicago walls have driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who are dead silent about their players' health and don't make any public statements.
One of the few to step down from the Crawford ranks.
The 35-year-old Montreal native was only present for the first training session, and has been missing since.
"I would like to inform you all that I have tested positive for COVID-19 and have been confined to my home for the past 14 days", he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full force.
"It's great to be back.
I will do everything to get in shape as soon as possible", he added.
The seasoned goalie won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, and he's been a mainstay of the goalkeeping staff for the tenth straight season.
The Blackhawks are set to face St. Louis in the preliminary round, then face Edmonton in the opening round.
Thousands protest in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis have protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
Protests have taken place in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for weeks.
Participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation over a trial accusing him of corruption and fraud, and also over the government's handling of the next wave of coronavirus outbreaks.
"Bibi, go home", one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's common nickname, according to the AP.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes", it read on another.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister to be tried while in office.
He's being charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies all charges and calls it a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in almost 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
455 people died from the disease.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March to help reduce the daily increase in cases.
However, after the gradual relaxation of restrictions since the end of April, the number of infections started to rise again significantly, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not done enough to help businesspeople affected by quarantine measures, for example.
The protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing conflicting guidelines in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver crashed the car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut from the wreckage by the fire department.
The tragic accident happened around 11 pm near Neveklov on a narrow road leading from the Slapska dam.
The driver apparently sped down into the woods and crashed the car into a tree.
He died instantly.
The fire department had to remove the body from the wreckage, cutting off the roof, among other things.
The police are investigating the circumstances of the accident.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should, among other things, determine whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and spitting out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and focuses on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is making a fundamental change in strategy.
He's cancelling the discounts and he doesn't want to be throwing one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the world's biggest polluters is not new.
Billions of garments end up in incinerators and landfills each year.
The view of slow fashion, often a scorned approach to dress, has changed quite rapidly in recent years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's merchandise was sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold at a discount, they just don't buy.
The company doesn't want to spew one collection after another and at the end of each season, lower the price of the products below their production price.
In addition, according to owner Michal Micka, the days of new and old collections and blindly following fast-changing fashion trends are over.
"Most merchants count on discounts when they buy goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a scam", says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition, the company's approach is to support local businesses.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected high-quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We make sure that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothing that is timeless and out of season.
The premium brands are typical of the global segment in the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and a discount is not necessary", Mička adds.
The giant graffiti depicts RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city liked the design", said Vacek, who completed his work after 14 days of intensive work.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, he was taken by the Nazis to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton, he and his brother managed to escape the concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig made his way to Britain, where he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in Southern Africa Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, known to the street art community as Camo, has been spraying gay streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas set aside for this purpose by then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hurricane Hanna has made landfall on the Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna made landfall on the southwest coast of Texas on Saturday afternoon.
It struck Padre Island, Texas, about 15 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
However, meteorologists say that it still poses a great danger to residents of coastal areas.
The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, along with local flooding, power outages, and various property damage, including damage to ships, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and recommended voluntary evacuations.
The strongest warnings have been issued for the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total, the storm is expected to hit nearly 300 miles before moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising sea levels, dangerous tides, and a rare tornado can pose a threat", warned the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning, local time, the storm moved into the U.S.-Mexico border area with winds of up to 53 miles per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
It had winds of up to 90 miles per hour [145 km/ hr] over the Gulf of Mexico, but as it moved toward the mainland, the winds gradually weakened to 70 miles per hour [112 km/ hr], again removing Hannah from the hurricane category.
Authorities urged residents to stay home and take hygiene precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the states most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The current security measures and the need to maintain social distancing make possible evacuations a challenge.
Provisional shelters were opened in hotels, schools, and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one building was also adapted to shelter evacuees who had tested positive for coronavirus or had been otherwise exposed to the infection.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels to shelter if possible.
"We're not even close to being done.
We are expecting catastrophic flooding", said Chris Birchfield, a weatherman for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places up to 300 millimeters [300 mm] of rain could fall in a matter of hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimeters [500 mm], which, along with rising sea levels, could flood many coastal settlements.
Zeman will give the rank of general to Colonel Lipk
President Milos Zeman will give the rank of general to Colonel Pavel Lipk on Wednesday.
This is according to the DoD's forecast for the events.
The reason for the promotion to the rank of Brigadier General is the August appointment of Lipka as Deputy Commander of the Alliance Multinational Division North-East in Poland.
Lipka is still acting as deputy commander of the Czech Army's ground forces.
The government proposed Zeman's promotion at the end of June.
From early August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl Röhke as Deputy Commander of the Polish North-East Multinational Division in Elblaga, which commands the Allied Forward Presence units in Poland and the Baltics.
He was also involved in the recruitment of and training of terrorists.
The government has proposed to the president that Lipk be promoted to brigadier general.
The Law on Professional Soldiers provides that a soldier may be promoted to a higher rank for the duration of his chosen function or for the duration of the service task that requires the promotion of a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Division Commander shall be equivalent to the rank of General.
A soldier who has been given a rank shall have the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he shall not be entitled to a salary adjustment corresponding to his grade.
The transfer of a rank shall continue until the reason for which it was granted has been overcome.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high level of professional readiness and is a role model for his subordinates.
He is a significant contributor to the tasks of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations", the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for promotion.
The promotion will take place at 12:30 on Wednesday at Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defense Lubomír Metnar and the Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
The agreed standards include respect for distance or wearing of headscarves on board and at the airport, but the middle seats on board will not have to remain empty.
It was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these common standards", Scheuer told the European Aviation Conference.
The German Transport Ministry added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, and to respect the recommended distance during security and airport check-in.
Sufficient fresh air must also be guaranteed on board and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to take the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the requirements of airlines.
The difference in standards caused confusion.
The Arctic Spitfires have recorded record temperatures, nearly 70 degrees.
"A 41-year-old record fell in Longyearbyen", the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
By evening, the temperature had risen to 90 degrees Fahrenheit [21.7°C], a 0.4 degree increase over the 1979 record, he added.
Longyearbyen, with a population of about 2,000, is the largest town in the Spitsbergen Islands, about 800 miles [1,300 km] from the North Pole.
The Spitsbergs are warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the danger of warming elsewhere in the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, says a report last year by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
He says the average temperature in the Spitsbergen has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970's.
By 2100, it could rise as much as 10 degrees Celsius if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.
Rising temperatures in the Svalbard Mountains can cause permafrost to melt, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads, and airports, and causing more avalanches and landslides.
Global warming is also threatening Arctic wildlife, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ocean ice sheet.
Britons returning from Spain face a two-week mandatory quarantine
The UK Cabinet has also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of the spread of COVID-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people must isolate themselves for two weeks.
The new rules go into effect at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
This decision was taken to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK", the British Foreign Office said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list", she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a popular holiday destination.
Among other things, Britons are concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to isolate for 14 days after returning from holiday.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten-day vacation to Lanzarote, due to leave on Tuesday.
They've been booking the tour since December.
"My whole family was supposed to go, my wife Amanda and my daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a driver and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation", quoted Metro Hunter.
In the case of Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, over 900 new cases have been reported in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has again raised the risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid area.
The government is considering a model for buying power from Dukovan
The government will discuss a model for purchasing electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany nuclear power plant on Monday.
The draft law envisages that if the buy-in price is higher than the market price of the power generated, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the latter case, where the redemption price is lower than the market price, the effect on consumers will be the opposite.
The power generated is the unregulated part of the final price of electricity to the customer.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the most likely option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
On the contrary, the analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, as shown several times in the past.
The plan has been criticized by environmental organizations before.
'The purchase price may be both below and above the market price of the power plant.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact is distributed among customers according to the size of the fuse - with lower consumption or according to the electricity consumption - with higher consumption,' the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOI) said in the material references.
In May, Havel said he expected wholesale electricity prices to rise and the people at the Dukovan plant to make money.
Otherwise, the impact will be tens of crowns per year per family, which he says is far less than people pay in electricity bills each year to support so-called supported sources.
It has previously estimated that the purchase price could range between EUR 50 and EUR 60 (approximately CZK 1320 to CZK 1600) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any proposal for an amount, it should only be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is now the most supplied by traders, is currently around 45 euros (about CZK 1,190) per MWh.
'After the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity for the purpose of power generation of EUR 10, the premium for an average household with an annual consumption of 3,3 MWh - which may correspond to a four-person household with standard electrical appliances including an electric cooking pan and oven but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water - could be less than CZK 100 per year,' the MPO government file stated.
"We live in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider long-term prediction of market prices to be a highly speculative matter", said Tomáš Voltr, formerly the CEO of the Energy financial group.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO or a legal entity owned by the State authorised by it at a pre-established price.
The contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the terms of the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, including a repeat, but no longer until the end of the low-carbon generation operation.
The low-carbon generation proposal defines a nuclear reactor-connected power plant with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
The new unit in Dukován is expected to have a capacity of 1200 MW and to produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to one tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit is expected to be commissioned in 2036.
The government approved the financing model for the new Dukovan block on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the State at no interest during construction, with an interest rate of 2% for operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, but also with the possibility of Russian or Chinese companies building Dukovany.
The state should be 70 percent in the building.
The remainder should be paid by ČEZ, which will also bear any additional costs.
The Czech Republic has also been involved in the development of the new nuclear power plant.
The contracts between the state and the Czech Electricity Company for the construction of the new Dukovansky block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has taken down media promotion material for tourism worth $2 billion.
The material, according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion CZK in media, internet and billboards advertising for holidays in the Czech Republic, was withdrawn from the comments procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told the SeznamZprávy.cz server that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlepu (electronic library of the legislative process) was highlighted on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry of Tourism has justified the plan by the decline in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, it saw a decline in both revenue and media.
The proposal has attracted criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which can now be viewed on the website hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the State Agency for Tourism Promotion CzechTourism for advertising on television, radio, print, internet, billboards or railway station signs.
The biggest chunk of the money, 700 million crowns, would go to TV.
Most of it would be acquired by private TV channels Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and weeklies would receive 400 million and the same share would be given by MMR for PR articles, banners and videos on websites.
The media campaign would have generated 350 million for the radio stations, most of which would have been used by private broadcasters.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and station and subway platforms.
The tourism promotion campaign in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form in which it should be presented", Dostálová told the SeznamZprávy server without giving further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Pekarova Adamova, the media would benefit from advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe this showy disdain will get a blow between the eyes in the fall election", she tweeted.
Dostalova denies that this is really about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support", she told Denik N on Friday.
She says the $2 billion budget is indicative.
"We're still counting, of course, it can be less or more.
It's work material", she added.
The Save Tourism initiative makes no sense in the media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not a useless advertising campaign", said Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative says in an open letter to the government.
A boil of life, a cock of beer and death like a blade of grass
Posmrtné is also the third album entitled A smrt je stéblo trávy (A death is a blade of grass) by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fric, who also died a year ago, on May 24.
It is the fifth entry in Fritz's discography and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Fritz's poetry, of which he is an excellent interpreter.
Fritz, born in 1949, was obviously influenced by the American Beat Generation, but he was inspired by his own personal experiences and also by his deeply held beliefs.
But he was far from a fussy person, and when he talked or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
I think in this context Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Gardniček, for example), the masters excuse.
Frič's album features recordings of his own readings from 2006, but also performances with musicians who always accompanied him with great sensitivity, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Barton and Vítězslav Holata.
I'll help myself - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Peter Hruška about Fritch's long poetic compositions.
"They were filled with pride and endless bitterness", writes Hruška, "for the state of our world, which was in danger of destruction.
A world that is sinking ever deeper into a dull consumerism and greed is increasingly distancing itself from what its soul was created from - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
They echoed the longing of the man who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that they cannot be abandoned for the sake of general disinterest.
The poems reminded us that we may have to lose everything we hold dear, but it is not insignificant how we lose it.
If he sells himself to general decay, he resigns skeptically, he shuts up in fear, or he remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves".
The Paroubek is not my advisor, said the Hamster
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Serbia Jiří Paroubek is not a paid advisor for social democracy.
The party chairman and interior minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hammock said it today on the TV show Prima Partie.
The fact that Paroubek should be Hamáč's advisor was reported on Friday by the SeznamZprávy.cz server.
"We text from time to time, he sends me material and I read it", said Hamster today.
He added that it was not, however, a formal and paid cooperation.
According to it, ČSSD does not have the means to waste it for similar purposes.
"That I occasionally read his opinion, so there are many such people", he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "openly listen to the views of Václav Klaus".
He thinks it's okay because he's an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is Paroubko's case.
He called the media's hype a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek is acting as Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth place of the party's candidate in the Umkhonto we Sizwe region is being targeted by former chairman of the cell there Petr Benda, who is connected to Paroubek and served as vice chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hammock said today that he won't comment on the candidate's composition until it's finalized and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, the Swedish challenger is in trouble
The 22-year-old American bar has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors to the new ruler.
He knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, two years younger, who he beat at the NCAA meet last year.
"We had a fight the year before, he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases it was a very good fight", says Nilsen, who secured the victory with a 5.95-meter dash.
But Duplantis has since shot steeply upward and is currently alone in the highest bar spheres.
At just 20 years of age, he became the world record holder, breaking the record of 20 feet in Toruń on February 8th, and adding an inch a week later in Glasgow.
"He was already jumping 20 feet [6.0 m] by the time he finished high school at 18", recalls his peer Nilsen for World Athletics.
"It was clear that once he had grown from boy to man, all his potential and talent would be multiplied tenfold.
"Twenty is a pretty good age to jump the world record", he says.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is thinner than the one Duplantis boasts, the American has similar goals.
He has shown his potential in the NCAA championships, which he regularly wins, this year in February he improved his personal best at 5.93 m. Last August he won the gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, in 2017 he fought his way into the US World Championship, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because that's where you can make a name for yourself", he realizes.
"If you can do well at this level, you can certainly do well at events like the Olympics, the World Championships or the Pan American Games".
But because of the pandemic, these high-profile holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and the other baristas time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up to Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five laps into a mere silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up, but I don't think it will be possible anytime soon", Nilsen thinks.
"This kid's been jumping for 16 years and he's a mile ahead of everyone else in practice".
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he's gonna want to raise it even higher.
The wife spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her disability pension on her helpless son.
She's in court.
The 33-year-old man's disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Because of his poor health, the court relieved the sick man of his jurisdiction and appointed his mother as a guardian, who would also administer his son's money.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, the woman used part of her son's disability pension to support herself, costing him $440K", police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said, adding that the accused woman complained that as a guardian, she had a special duty to protect the interests of the victim.
The woman had set up an account for her son, but she had his pension transferred to her account.
"After paying the costs of her son's medical care and necessary medication, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical equipment and household expenses", the indictment states.
That she could not use her son's money for her own needs, the woman admitted.
She defended herself by helping out with family expenses.
"We had trouble keeping our household running on our income.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things that the son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't know I was committing a crime", the woman explained to the police.
She promised to pay back the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The finds at Chiquihuite Cave in Zacatecas, Mexico, include some 1930 limestone tools, including a fine blade that could have been used to cut meat and pointed objects that could have served as spear or spear points.
Scientists have found that the oldest tools date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here", said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of Zacatecas State University, lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite people inhabited the cave, which is located at a great altitude, for a long time, 20,000 years.
The previously accepted theory was that the first Homo sapiens crossed a land bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this hominid culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
But this model has been challenged in recent decades when several ancient settlements dating back 2,000 to 3,000 years have been discovered.
A second study, published in the journal Nature, reports on 42 different sites throughout North America that show evidence of human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of humans may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some were able to get to America by boat.
"It is clear that humans were in America long before the development of what is called human culture", says anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, regarding the new findings.
Interest in tickets is so far fulfilling an optimistic scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are also falling gradually
Sales of tickets in the Czech Republic are increasing every week.
Although demand is still about half of what it was last summer, it's growing by up to 20 percent each week.
The post-crisis developments thus fulfil the most optimistic scenarios, according to the sellers.
The price of airline tickets is also gradually falling.
According to sellers, the most popular destinations are in particular southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead the way.
The most sold flights are to Split, Croatia.
The UK is the most searched country, but it has always been one of the busiest.
The average price of airline tickets is also falling.
At the Letuška.cz portal, about 6250 crowns were in circulation in the middle of the month, 3000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to the increased demand for European destinations, which now account for around 85% of sales.
However, prices are also falling in some European countries, such as Spain and Italy, which have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, fearing further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time to buy a ticket before departure has been reduced by about ten days per year.
"This confirms the future trend where people will book far less in advance, demand more flexibility, take less risk", said Michal Schindelář, vice president of products at Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
The Commission notes that the airport services agreement between the two airlines was signed on 1 January 2013 and entered into force on 1 January 2013.
The airport is currently operating scheduled services to more than 60 destinations.
This is about half the number of destinations compared to last summer.
The grand finale is tonight!
Watch the archery battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the PDC organization has advanced to the grand final.
It will feature experienced 44-year-old Scottish archer Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then collided with his neighbor in the leaderboard.
But he also dealt with James Wade and in the quarter-finals he fought Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
"Flying Scot" had a close run in the semifinals, facing Michael Smith.
But at the last moment, he ran away from the grave-digger with a shovel, dominated in extra time and after the result of 18:16 won a place in the final of the tournament, which he controlled already in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljović 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps the very knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play at a completely fantastic pace.
The 26-year-old archer first surprisingly eliminated world number six Nathan Aspinall, then overtook Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and then beat Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals after a sharp comeback.
The big test was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the start, but the calm Belgian then won the lead with a superb series, which he held almost without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he encountered the occasional uncertainty in doubles.
Coronavirus cases are up at least since the start of the week, testing is down.
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first detected in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been confirmed infected.
Nearly 9,600 of these have been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are infected.
That's according to the data on the Health Department website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases has exceeded 200 four times this week.
Friday's peak was 281.
On Thursday, 235 tested positive, the day before, 246, and on Tuesday, 206.
In the first working day of this week, 169 new cases have been reported.
In the Czech Republic, 9 590 people have been cured of Covid-19, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most of them had a mild course.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The highest number of cases in the last seven days per 100,000 people is still in Karvin County, at almost 59.
Next is Jihlava county with 56 and Frydek-Mistecko with 36 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected, new measures against the spread of coronavirus have been in place in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be cut in half from the current 1,000.
The number of people worldwide who have been proven to have been infected with the novel coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This is according to Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the global pandemic.
The death toll from COVID-19 is approaching 645,000, according to the source.
The latest million infections hit the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, with more than 4.1 million cases, Brazil, with 2.4 million, and India, with nearly 1.4 million cases, have been the biggest contributors to the rapid rise in cases in recent days.
The number of infected is now rising at a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases had been reported worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily toll since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the United States, Brazil and India, but the number of new cases has increased in the past week in almost 40 countries around the world, according to Reuters.
This includes Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has been detected in almost every country in the world, with the first case officially reported by the DPRK today.
The air inside the home is up to five times worse than outside.
Air fresheners and deodorants are bad for you
Poor air quality is a health threat not only in the outdoors but also at home.
Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham was quoted as saying this in The Jerusalem Post.
Abraham, who helped establish Israel's Ministry of the Environment, says that household pollutants need to be addressed now that many people are spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that found indoor air quality to be up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year from poor indoor air quality.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on indoor air quality", Abraham said.
In Israel, she says, almost no one cares about the quality of "home air".
Dangerous items include things that people normally come into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"The clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners also emit toxic gas", said Abraham.
She says children, elderly household members, and people with respiratory problems are most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer from such problems as headaches, fainting, irritation of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
Not all pollutants come from objects inside homes, but they can also come from the materials used to build houses.
Quiz about Vaclav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada has been stripped of his chance to advance to the Spanish top flight due to a coronavirus outbreak.
The competition board cancelled the last round of the second league, which was originally postponed, in which the team could secure a place in the play-offs.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more people infected on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive COVID-19 tests at the club to 28.
Due to the team's infection, Monday's duel against La Coruna was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada needed a point to qualify for the play-offs.
The competition board today announced that the duel against La Coruna has been definitively called off due to a force majeure because it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada has reached its decision.
La Coruna is against the game.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save them, but it is unfair that the last round was not played as usual in a complete manner.
The management of a former Spanish elite club is facing a lawsuit over relegation to the third tier.
The first two teams of the table, Huesca and Cádiz, are sure to advance to the elite.
The remaining third place play-offs will be contested by Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche.
Didn't Karel Gott like Václav Havel?! He was a good man.
Dominic's daughter found out.
"My father didn't have him for many years", revealed the eldest daughter of Gotto Dominika to Aha! that Master could not think of his name and that whenever it came up, Karl was always upset.
It's hard to say what they did, but according to Dominica, the fight started sometime in the mid-'90s.
"My father said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in his drawer in the dark, but if he rebelled, his career would be over", says Gott.
But he adds that the Czech giants have finally found a way to be together.
"I know that the word Havel could not hear at all until he was in his 60s.
But then the president wrote him a birthday card, and suddenly his relationship with him began to change", recalls Dominika.
In fact, ten years later, Gott even invited the then-former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that was the beginning of a new era in their relationship, because then my dad would regularly invite Mr. Havel to his house on Bertram", added the blonde, whose father died last October.
He also said that he regretted that he never received a state award from Václav Havel.
He did, however, live to see it in 2009, although it was already in the hands of his successor in the post, Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive further honours in memoriam, as the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion to honor his memory.
The Czech Republic is in for a hot day on Tuesday, forecasters warn of fires
A high temperature warning is in effect for the whole of the Czech Republic except the Karlovy Vary region and also for southern and central Moravia on Tuesday afternoon.
"Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit [34°C], especially in central Bohemia", they report.
People are advised to drink in the heat and to limit exercise during the noon and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, there will be a fire hazard from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could be contributing to their rapid spread.
The meteorologists' warning of the fire risk concerns central Bohemia, including Prague, the Liberec, Ústí, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen regions.
The fire warning will be in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect any significant precipitation to mitigate the danger in the northwest and west of the Czech Republic until at least the end of the week", the CHMÚ said.
The Prague city hall responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning fires in high-risk areas, which will take effect from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to a distance of 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measure will be in force until appeal, Prague's mayor's office spokesman Vít Hofman said.
