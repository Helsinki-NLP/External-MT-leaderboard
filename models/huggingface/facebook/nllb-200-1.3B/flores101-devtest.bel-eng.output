Not only does this confirm the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that is not usually obtained by studying fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown on the top and had a pale or red-yellow hue on the reverse side.
This discovery helps us better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed trunk, but have other features of feathers, such as hooves and whiskers, the researchers concluded that the feathers were likely a late evolutionary change from other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or to attract attention, and the researchers assumed that even though it was a tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen was not a bird's feather, but an adult's forehead.
The researchers suggest that although it was a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen showed the tail of an adult animal, not the plumage of a bird.

Keir Starmer, the Royal Counsel and Attorney General, issued a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of Hune and Price.
Hyeon resigned and was replaced by Ed Davey, the member of parliament who is expected to step down as minister of trade and industry, and Norman Lam, the member of parliament who is leaving.
On February 16, Price and Hyun are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Peace Court.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cadebec, 21, died in the accident, and Cadebec was driving.
Christopher Schneider is going to need plastic surgery on his face, and Edgar Vegela has been injured in his jaw and arm.
When Uka pointed the gun at the fifth soldier's head, it didn't work, and now Schneider is suffering from chronic pain, blind in one eye, missing part of his skull, and his face is now partly made of titanium.
Schneider was giving his testimony from his own country via video link while he was on a U.S. Navy base.
Apart from Wednesday's competition, Carponeda took part in two individual races.
She first competed in the slalom, where she retired from the distance in the first race, and 36 of the 116 participants showed the same result.
During her performance in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the seated position with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first place of the Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth place of the Hungarian Jongi Dani.
Four skiers from the group of athletes with limited physical abilities did not reach the finish, and 45 of the total number of 117 skiers could not qualify for participation in the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to the owner by the Madhya Pradesh Police.
"We arrested five people who raped a Swiss tourist, and we were able to recover her cell phone and laptop", said D. K. Arya, deputy inspector general.
Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar  these are the names of those who are named as the accused.

Despite the fact that when the car hit the house, there were three people, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver received severe head injuries.
While emergency services were releasing the driver of the red "Audi TT", traffic on the road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed.
He was first admitted to the James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital.
Odekoya has since been in Edinburgh's Sheriff's Court, accused of murdering her son.
She is awaiting indictment and trial while in custody, but given that her photographs have been widely published, any testimony of the witnesses could be questioned.
In other parts of the UK, this is common practice, but in Scotland the law works differently - the courts believe that publishing photos can be potentially harmful.
"It seems that journalists are taking a dangerous path by publishing photos and so forth of suspects", observes Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Chancellery of the High Court, authorized to bring to criminal responsibility, informed journalists that at least until the incriminating conclusion is presented, no further comments will be obtained.
According to the information, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in a way that preserves the borders that existed before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The information obtained accordingly, among other topics covered in the document  issues of the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, as well as the problem of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that after the signing of the agreement, the military presence in the valley be maintained for ten years, while Palestine agrees to only five years.
Shooters who took part in the additional program for the control of the spread of animals had to be under the close supervision of rangers, because the program was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service, in partnership with the Australian Shooting Association, Inc. recruited qualified volunteers to participate in the shooting program, which is being implemented under the auspices of the Shooting Association.
Mick Flynn, the acting acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service for conservation and heritage, said the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation were given comprehensive safety instructions and trained accordingly.
Martelli yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council.
This is the fifth election of the Provisional Council of Martea in four years.
The presidential commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Provisional Electoral Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
Martelli responded to the large anti-regime protests that began in October with a commission.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes violent and angry, was the absence of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating, resulting in six fires, and four people suffering minor burns.
According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEGP), the 27 accidents that occurred as a result of the use of the devices, they had information.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 new cases of overheating, which it had classified as "non-serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "deserving of deep regret".
The quake struck the Marianas at 7:19 p.m. local time (at 9:19 p.m.
Officials from the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of destruction or accidents in the country.
In addition, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of the typhoon.
A former Filipino police officer seized a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila and held Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Roland Mendoza fired on the tourists with his M16.
Several hostages were rescued, and by this time, at least six were confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including elderly people and children, as well as the photographers from the Philippines, were released early.
The old lady needed a toilet, so the photographers were held hostage instead.
Liggins followed his father's example and became a doctor.
He studied obstetrics and in 1959 he started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins took time off from work to study the problem of premature births.
His research showed that the hormone injection accelerates the maturation of the embryo's lungs.
According to Xinhua news agency, government investigators on Wednesday found two so-called "black boxes" recorders of flight data.
Luna's memory was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
"Mona was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. She passed away in the night two months. It's pretty original, like she did.
Dustin Goldstein Runnels said, "Mona was a freak, no less than I am... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I want to believe she's in a better place now".
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (based on a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, the acting Prime Minister, stated that she believed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
That's what 34 percent of the respondents say, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of those who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent who, on the contrary, hold the view that it should never happen.
It was expected that the Olympic gold medalist would swim 100 and 200 metres freestyle and take part in three relay events during the Commonwealth Games, but his physical form raises doubts: he has complained quite a lot about his health.
He couldn't take painkillers because they're banned at the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri State University, found the largest prime number known to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
It is thought that comets may have brought to Earth not only organic matter, which can form proteins and serve as a source of life, but also water.
Given that comets have collided with the Earth in the distant past, scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, primarily Earth.
Earlier this year, Cuomo, 53, was elected governor, signing a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political babble and stupidity".
It is assumed that in 2016 he will run for president.
The Federal Aviation Administration says that the NextGen system will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and cutting carbon emissions.
Unlike the old ground-based radar, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and give pilots more accurate information.
Traffic is not increasing, and land trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking spaces on the ground level, nor any pick-up parking.
The odds of having to play a game behind closed doors without fans were increasing, because there might not be enough transportation.
The formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador is described in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to a report by researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of the new species occurred in just two generations, although it was previously believed that this process took much longer. The emergence of the new species was made possible by crossing endemic earthworm (Geospiza fortes) with local cactus earthworm (Geospiza conirostris).
You can cast gold into various shapes, and you can scatter it into thin sheets.
You can pull it out into thin wire, and then you can twist it and weave it, and you can also undo it or scatter it in the leaves.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it could be so thin that it was occasionally used to decorate illustrated books, or so-called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH level of a certain chemical, and you can make this acid-base indicator out of red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of a particular substance.
The pH level in a chemical substance is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter N in pH).
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, the hydrogen atom contains one proton and one electron).
Mix these two dried powders in a circle until they are joined together into one whole, and then use your wet hands to make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange feeling, and it forms a kind of shell.
In almost every home in Harapa and Mahendj-Dara, you could find a washbasin that was connected to a complex sewage system.
In Greek cities on Crete and Santorini, houses dating back to the Minoan period have found remains of sewage systems.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman Empire, the unites were sometimes installed in public baths where men and women were together.
You use a satellite phone when you're calling someone thousands of miles away.
In space, a satellite receives a call, and then almost instantly reflects it back.
The rocket was used to send a satellite into space, and scientists are forced to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere refracts light and distorts images.
For a telescope or satellite to go into space, you need a massive rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. Moving easier and faster -- that's the biggest thing the wheel has done for us.
He made trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
Below are the medium-sized cats, which are also medium-sized and hunt both rabbits and antelopes with deer.
In addition, many small cats (including pets on the open air) catch and eat more numerous small prey  insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is that each cat has its own niche, a unique function, and therefore does not have to compete with other cats.
Lions are among the most sociable cats: they live in large flocks, known as prides.
Pride may include up to three adult males, who are cousins, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion-prays and wolf packs or dogs are similar in many ways, the latter being similar to lions (but not other big cats) in that they pose a mortal threat to their prey.
A tiger can climb (but not so well), jump over great distances, swim, and pull with strength five times stronger than a strong man, like a well-trained athlete.
The tiger is one of the three groups of cats that cannot roar, along with the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The roar of a tiger is more like a sentence made up of sharp and loud words than the full-voice roar of a lion.
The acelots feed on small animals, and when they can, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds, and almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than the acelots.
Scientists believe that they hunt and find their prey by smell, sniffing the tracks on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see well in the dark and move with great confidence, hunting for their prey, blending in with their surroundings and attacking from hiding.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (say, when moving through a river or a mountain range or when such organisms migrate to a new island, so that it will be quite difficult for them to return), they often end up in an environment that is very different from where they came from.
In this new environment of different resources and competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different traits or adaptations from those it had before.
The original population hasn't changed at all: it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, animals become less and less like the original population from which they split.
Thousands, even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later, these two populations will look so different that no one will even think of classifying them as the same species.
This is what we call species formation, which is actually the emergence of new species, and species formation is an inevitable outcome and a very important step in evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe, and they also use carbon dioxide that we breathe out.
Plants cook food from sunlight through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our homes out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, we eat mostly plants, and animals wouldn't survive without plants either.
For their time, the masosaurs were super-terrifying, so they were afraid of nothing and no one except other masosaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and an extra line at the top of his mouth meant that his prey would be unlikely to survive.
It is not known for sure, but it is possible that the mosasaur had a split tongue. The mosasaur's diet consisted of large fish, turtles, and other mosasaurs, and it is likely that they could also eat members of their own species.
Besides, he would throw himself at anything that hit the water; his tray was not even as big as a giant like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Although their food was mostly unusual, some of the dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual, including wild turkeys, pollies, snails, and one of the rodents known as the nutmeg.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich people had banquets where they ate and rested.
The dishes of ancient Rome could not include foods that later came to Europe from the Americas or Asia.
They had no potatoes, no tomatoes, no corn, no cocoa, and, of course, no ancient Roman ever had the chance to taste a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, and it was their home.
The faithful offered sacrifices to their gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs by holding various festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had an open courtyard and a sanctuary, which were only open to priests.
In some cases, the temples were built with special towers, similar to pyramids, known as the Zicurates.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house didn't mean much.
For the most part, the life of a Jewish family was spent in the fresh air.
Women cooked outside; shops were just open counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
Because of the lack of large forests in Canaan, wood was highly valued.
Greenland was not densely populated, and according to the Norse legend, Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he sailed west, he found Greenland, which he called "the Greenland".
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at the time.
There were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you've seen the movie "Treasures of the Nation", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
And it's not a treasure map, even though it's actually written on the back of the document.
The Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, had the following inscription: The original version of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The inscription in reverse is at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was folded up early in its existence for safekeeping.
So it's quite possible that this recording was just added there as a memory.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battle liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was under the control of the Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation Dragon began, and the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the Free French forces liberated the southern French territories in just two weeks, and then headed for Germany.
Civilization is the unique culture of a fairly large group of people working and living together in a society.
The term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, which means "civil", and is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, meaning "citizen", and to the noun civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state". All of this, in turn, tells us something about the size of society.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations, and civilized culture means the transfer of knowledge across generations, the equal distribution, and the sustained cultural trace.
Often, small cultures are not considered to be civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear without leaving significant historical evidence.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government under the Treaty of the Confederation of the Thirteen States, which was composed of only the Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since the national executive and judicial branches did not exist, it relied on the support of government agencies, which were often not willing to interact, to enforce all laws.
In addition, he lacked the authority to overturn state tax laws and tariffs.
The Confederation Treaty required the unanimous consent of all the states to make any changes, and the states were so disillusioned with central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, like the German national team, is ranked second among the strongest national teams in the world. In 2006, it won the FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing are among the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, while Italians also participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the island of Honshu, making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is often called an archipelago geographically, because it is a cluster or group of islands.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when its name was recorded by European sailors passing by as "Pharmoza" meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive practice of baking, hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) in 1683 captured western and northern Taiwanese territories and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government in 1895 concluded the Treaty of Shimonosek, under which Japan was granted sovereignty over the island, and the latter held the island in Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings: Incihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
To give tourists a better idea of how most of the buildings on the edges of the complex originally looked, the latter were rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
So the most popular still format in the world is 35mm, and at the tail end of the analogue era, this was the dominant film format.
This film is still being made, but more importantly, the ratio of its width to height is now used in the matrix formats of digital cameras.
This may be a bit confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Accordingly, the aspect ratio for this format (after dividing by twelve to get the simplest proportion of integers) is  3:2.
The same or similar side-relations have many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats).
The rule of thirds, often attacked and ridiculed, is a simple set of tips that provide dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
If he is to be believed, the best place to place the main object is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photograph in the vertical and horizontal planes by a third (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church became rich and powerful.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that existed, the Christian religion held Europe together for over a thousand years.
From the king to the commoner, everyone was under her all-pervading power.
The essence of one of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and alleviate suffering, and that's what the church's money is for.
For over a thousand years, Rome has been the seat of church power, and with such a concentration of power and money, many wonder whether this dogma is being upheld.
Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
Embargo on the supply of vital goods for military and civilian purposes violated generally recognized international law, which over the past two centuries has been enshrined in several international treaties, but has proved to be an effective strategy.
Britain blocked international waters to prevent ships from reaching certain areas of the ocean, putting even neutral ships in danger.
Because there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany thought that it would not be used for unrestricted submarine warfare either.
Most citizens and countries in the 1920s were pacifist and secluded.
The nations and the people were determined to avoid this in the future, because they had already witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he found work at the Edison Company in New York City.
Just four cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Bachlor (his manager from his previous job), were in his pocket when he arrived in the United States.
Ancient China had unique ways of representing different eras, and at each stage of China's history, or within each ruling family, there were distinct dynasties.
In addition, the dynastic reigns were divided into periods of united provinces, when instability prevailed. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jing dynasties.
During these periods, many of the nobles who fought for the throne fought fierce battles against each other.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history was the Three Kingdoms era, when thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences, including the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the belief that the country did not belong to an individual ruler, but to the people as a whole.
And also, post-Revolutionary jobs were open to all male candidates, and the most successful and ambitious men were pushed to the top.
The same thing happened in the army, whereas previously military ranks were awarded based on rank, now they are awarded based on skill and ability.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
The Mahomet was deeply interested in matters beyond the confines of the world, and for meditation and contemplation, he frequently visited the cave on Mount Nur (translated as light), known as Hira.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid insight into the spiritual foundations of Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world  it is on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's very hard to find, even if someone knows it's there, because inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
Except for the clear, beautiful skies above and the many surrounding mountains, you can't see much of that world from the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids built to commemorate the godless pharaoh in the 3rd century BC.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Necropolis of Giza, in Egypt's Death Valley, is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs  by the wife and members of the Pharaoh's family.
The symbol for the upward movement of the knot looks like V, and downward  like a bracket or square without a bottom.
The upward movement of the consonant means that you start at the end of the consonant and you go up, and the downward movement of the consonant means that you start at the stick (where your hand holds the consonant) and you go downward.
The upward movement of the hook usually gives a softer sound, while the downward movement is stronger and more confident.
You can write your marks with a pencil, but remember that the punctuation marks that are printed are not just there for the sake of it, they're there for a musical purpose, so they usually need to be kept.
On October 6, 1789, the crowds of women from the market terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis Charles and 11-year-old Marie Theresa), and Madame Elizabeth, the king's sister, to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family was taken to Paris in a carriage, and as they walked, they were surrounded by a crowd of people whistling, wailing, and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the windows of the carriage under the influence of the crowd.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved to the queen, who was already terrified to death, with the head of a guard who had been shot at Versailles.
The military expenses of the U.S. imperialists that were incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a significant portion of the costs and interest on the bonds that were placed through the Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the US imperialists would have been the excessive profits that resulted from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand who the Templars were, you need to understand what the order was about.
Traditionally, the era in which these events occurred is called the Classical Middle Ages, a period of European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The Early Middle Ages followed by the Classical Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages, which are generally considered to have ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" is used to describe a range of practical ideas, from the push to promote certain technologies or technical necessity to the exact understanding that human destiny is governed by the logic on which scientific laws are based, and their embodiment in the realm of technology.
Two general ideas are typical of most explanations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself largely goes beyond cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, makes its own (rather than socially driven) impact on society.
In particular, there is a belief that the use of cars is driving the development of roads.
However, if the number of cars is small, a nationwide network of highways is not economically viable, and new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The increased number of car owners is causing more road accidents, which in turn is leading to new health care techniques that treat a variety of injuries.
A large element of cultural determinism, influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichtel, and Schlegel, was typical of Romanticism.
In the Romantic era, people were heavily influenced by the geography of presence, and over time, traditions and culture emerged that were more relevant than arbitrary laws, because they were in harmony with the place and position that society occupied.
While Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 CE, the city gained fame as the epicenter of luxury and retained this status until almost 1100 CE.
By the 12th century, it had become a luxury capital, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts of spices and silk, which were much more expensive than they were on the Byzantine markets.
It was then that Constantinople succeeded Paris as the fashion capital.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries, and into the 14th century.
At first, the style of clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles may be 25-30 years behind because of the slow pace of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style in the late Middle Ages, and the use of buttons to fasten clothes during the Crusades was one of the major events of the time.
Natural agriculture produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple and generally organic system based on the use of seed from a specific ecological region in combination with rotation or other non-complicated methods, with the goal of maximizing yields.
Many farmers have historically practiced organic farming, and many developing countries still do.
Subcultures bring people together who share similar beliefs, who feel excluded from the standpoint of social norms, and they allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of representatives may be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a particular subculture may be based on various factors such as language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination thereof.
Members of the same subculture often identify themselves with a distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, manners, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, children are often cited as having the misfortune to grow up in an environment of contempt, neglect, misery, humiliation, and abuse, and who were not socialized by adults as children.
Some of these children were held in captivity for long periods of time (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the lack of parental care was due to the parents' unwillingness to notice serious physical or intellectual defects and shortcomings in the child.
Before they were abandoned or fled, the children who were left to flee were likely to suffer severe abuse or trauma.
Others were reportedly raised by animals; some were rumored to have lived independently in the wild.
When a child is fully raised by an animal, his behavior almost in all (including physical limitations) reflects the behavior of the animal-rearing: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or be indifferent to them.
While the goal of project learning is to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that helps people learn new things in their learning, which can mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual, such as a teacher and a little bit of a Microsoft Office plugin.
The software includes virtual assistants to ask questions, make suggestions, and explain procedures that are difficult for the student or listener to handle on their own.
There are many reasons why children end up in foster care, and they can be abusive, neglected, or even forced.
You can't let kids grow up in an environment where they're not cared for, raised, educated, and yet it happens.
We think that the foster care system is a safe haven for these kids.
The idea is that with our foster care system, the foster children will have reliable health care, safe homes, caring and caring educators, and a stable education.
It is believed that the adoptive family must provide for all the needs of the child that were not met in the house from where he was taken.
The Internet is not only a means of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet create additional opportunities for its use and to meet the needs of the audience.
For example, it is suggested that concepts such as "education" and "socialization" are powerful motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal engagement" and "persistent relationship" have also been identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation in studying audience reactions to online sites.
The video has made important discoveries in explaining micro-cuts, which are facial muscle movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It has been claimed, among other things, that correct interpretation of micro-words can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his book, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks noted how people with brain damage who don't understand speech can still accurately judge honesty.
He even suggests that animals - such as domestic dogs - may also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century suggests that there are two sources of genetic variation, namely, the explicit and the implicit variation.
Mutations create new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool.
With each successive generation, segregation and recombination mix variations in these two pools.
In savannas, the available plant resources cannot meet the primate's need for amino acids when their digestive system is similar to that of humans.
And if they fail, the consequences can be serious, including malnutrition, growth depression, and inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins, which are found in beans and leaves, but if they're not cooked properly, it's hard for primate organisms like us to absorb them.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of proteins, rich in all the necessary amino acids and at the same time easily digested.
So, it shouldn't surprise us to find out that our ancestors solved their own protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees in savannas do today.
Interruption of sleep is the deliberate awakening of a sleeping person in the process of normal sleep and the re-awakening after a short time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up, but not completely.
If you find yourself moving your watch in your sleep, try putting it at the other end of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other biorhythm-based variants, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluid (primarily water or tea, a well-known moccanoid) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
A person's inner calm is inversely proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
The life force is all the more positive when it is lower in tension, and absolute peace and contentment are available to everyone.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only obstacle to it is our own negativity and tension.
The core of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of Buddha, which were supplemented by the love of the Mahayana and a number of techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all of humanity.
Kundalini yoga followers say that to awaken the Kundalini energy, you need to practice certain yoga poses, mantras, and visualizations, as well as breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a core part of Tibetan meditation practice, and visualizing different gods clears energy channels, opens chakras, and achieves enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led the USSR and the United States to cooperate, and after the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to conflict between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins  former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it really involved friendly armies, and the battlefields were all over the world, from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken by 17 September 1939. Retreat and regroupment along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, overnight, these plans were dashed, as over 800,000 Red Army soldiers as part of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Cargo shipping is clearly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the Navy has been to ensure that their country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time the enemy is unable to transport their own people and goods.
One of the most significant examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to help Britain by transporting people and supplies across the Atlantic.
Meanwhile, the German Navy tried to stop the movement, using submarines primarily.
Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way that it had conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them to keep milk, wool, meat, and leather at hand.
The goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often looked after by children or teenagers, who were often shepherds.
In the 16th century, England built paved roads.
Although the paved roads were only parallel wooden boards, they allowed the draught horses to move at a higher speed and pull loads with a greater weight than on existing uneven roads.
The use of shovels to hold the rails in place began early, but it was later realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, but due to the presence of iron, wooden wheels of wagons were more quickly worn.
The first fully metal rails appeared in 1767.
The first known means of movement was walking, and two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus, people started walking upright.
Astralopithecines, their predecessors, did not usually walk upright.
Wandering individuals of Australopithecines have been found in fossils dating to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but it is quite possible that seven million years ago, a sachelanthropus already walked on two legs.
You can become more environmentally conscious, you can become a part of the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that in the future, these kinds of suffering don't get too bad.
Often, this looks more like a symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to find and eliminate the root of the problem.
It's pretty obvious that the world has changed dramatically because of technological and scientific advances, and overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles have caused a lot of problems.
After the declaration was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was delivered to the John Dunlop Printing House, located a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, known today as Dunlop's Arkuches.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document for the first time in public at Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The first 25 printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides) have survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and that they still exist today, but we call them birds.
Because of their feathers and ability to fly, many people don't think they're dinosaurs.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, they lay eggs, and like the Tyrannosaurus rex, they walk on two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers are encoded with information in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can have either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers, or bits.
Internal intoxication may not have obvious signs, but vomiting is a common symptom that makes it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The first sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of pills or toxic household chemicals.
The emergency medical instructions for this particular poison are on the label.
For the designation of this group of insects entomologists use the term klop in the formal sense.
The term came about because people have long known that bed bugs are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both kissing and bed bugs are nest parasites, and they've adapted to living in their host's nests or house.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, which means it's a neurological disease that's prevalent among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may conclude that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child they already have.
Such couples may give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the child's birth parents renounce their parental rights so that other spouses can raise and raise him.
The main purpose of science is to find out through the scientific method how the world works, and in fact, most of the research we do is done through this method.
Experiments (a test that is done to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and observing) also stimulate scientific research.
The most important work of philosophers and naturalists has been the classical text, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were generally accepted at the time.
As the number of people who spoke Greek declined, the West was torn from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many of the biorhythms that we observe in animal behavior and physiology are largely dependent on endogenous cycles, which are the result of the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have periodic rhythms that are not a direct response to periodic signals from the outside.
The biological clock is an autonomous process, and even when no signals are received from the outside, the process continues as independent free-flowing cycles.
One of the main hypotheses that DNA is genetic material was tested in the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they used radioactive phosphorus to mark the DNA of a bacteriophage or radioactive sulfur to mark the protein of a bacteriophage.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether or not the germline cells are affected, mutations can have very different consequences.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be inherited, and other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in visiting different natural areas and territories, because they want to enjoy the general species and landscape, including enjoying observing flora and fauna.
Examples of what you can do in the wild include fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks, and exploring ecosystems.
One example is the visit, study, and photography of orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People drive out of small towns every morning to work, and they're driven by other people who work where they just left.
In this dynamic transportation cycle, everyone has somehow a connection to the private car-based transportation system and supports it.
The evidence suggests that today's high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has been a major contributor to human evolution for the past two million years.
Transportation is used by all the people who participate in society, and almost all of them are unhappy with transportation.
In the developed world, you don't hear so many complaints about falling bridges or water quality.
Why are transportation systems such a constant source of complaints, why do they regularly fail, is it because of the inadequate skills of transportation engineers, or is something more significant happening?
The concept of traffic implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is a complex problem, because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent manner, so traffic flows tend to have a certain rationally determined sequence and can be approximated by mathematical models.
To more fully and qualitatively show what is the traffic of vehicles, it was established as related to each other three of its main parameters: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These connections help us plan and design roadways and operate them.
The first animals to fly were insects, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more effectively, and to find mates and food.
In most cases, insects fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hunt in different, very small places to hide from predators.
Today, the ostrich and the one-day fly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
A man named Aristarchus, a few thousand years ago, argued that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many held the other view that the solar system (including the sun and other stars) revolves around the earth.
Sounds reasonable, because it's hard to say from the ground that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest river on Earth and the largest, with eight times the volume of water as the second longest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that enters the oceans from the rivers of the planet.
The Amazon River, which is fed by thousands of smaller rivers, is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size and technical perfection.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were amazed by the monuments erected by their ancestors, which at that time were over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has only about 800 inhabitants, making it the smallest independent country with the smallest population in the world.
Italian is the official language of Vatican legislation and official communications.
Most of those working in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Because basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper occur naturally and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools, people have known about them since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that said that all things consist of one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
It looked more like four states of matter, in the same order: solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although his theory was that they could be transformed into other substances to become what we see.
In most cases, an alloy  is a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
And then there are those alloys that contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles -- atoms.
Atoms are so small that the dot at the end of this sentence would contain trillions of them.
And as a result, when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, the pencil's value and frequency have been declining with the advent of new writing techniques.
People are now texting on computer screens, and no one needs a keyboard.
We can only guess what the fate of the keyboard will be when it is replaced by something fundamentally new.
The principle of a plutonium bomb is to use the energy of nuclear fusion to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a very heavy chariot up a hill, and splitting the nucleus again will release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down under little or no external influence.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side  about 100 km.
The moon's crust is thinner under the moon's moonlight, and thicker under the moon's high mountains.
The lunar seas might be more on the near side of the moon, because the crust is thinner, and therefore, the lava would be easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what attracts them.
Theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they turn into internal ones and that are subjectivised (internalised) during adulthood.
These theories describe what exactly makes people want to do what they do, and what factors in their environment might influence whether they do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two of the most authoritative content theories.
Basically, when managers are in charge of their former colleagues, there are two types of behavior that can occur, and at one end of the spectrum, there's the desire to be their boyfriend or girlfriend.
This type of manager may have difficulty evaluating performance, making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, allocating responsibility, and holding those responsible accountable.
The other extreme is when the person is transformed beyond recognition -- feels the need to change everything the team has done and embrace it.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this type of behavior ends up in a fight between the leader and the rest of the team.
The standards of perfection for traditional teams should be the same for virtual teams, but there are slight differences.
Usually, virtual team members act as a contact center for the relevant real-world group.
Given that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may be unintelligible to local authorities.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The team of leaders that each member follows is called the "invisible team" and it sets standards for each member.
What is the reason an organization would want to go through the continuous process of organizational learning? Innovation  Here's one of the reasons why we put organizational learning into practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can only come about when all the resources available in the functional departments of an organization are used efficiently.
So the process that an organization uses to work together to overcome a challenge can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
The leadership of an organization must create a culture that is characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning, and only then can an organization be called innovative.
Angel (2006) defines the continuum as a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
The theoretical approach to cognitive research is backed up by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data, narrowing the field of study and making it more precise.
The findings of recent research confirm that there is a close relationship between brain pathology and human behavior.
It's long been known that different types of traumatic brain injury, brain injuries, formations, plaques, pathological changes, and brain tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
New technologies are making it possible to explore the structure of the brain and the processes that we have never known.
This gives us a huge amount of material and data to build simulation models, which in turn helps us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
While the term AI is often associated with science fiction, AI is actually a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of computers.
Research in artificial intelligence involves trying to automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
Examples include planning and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical problems, and the ability to recognize faces, voices, and text messages.
They've broken into disciplines that study real-life problems and offer solutions to them.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, technology, and military applications, and as a software component in some computer programs and video games.
Excursions are a big part of schooling, and often the teacher takes the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
With the help of technology, virtual tours can be organized, where students can visit museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of artworks, all without leaving the classroom.
Sharing virtual tours is also a great way to reflect on travel and share experiences in future classes.
The students at Bennett High School in North Carolina, for example, design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and they rework it every year, but they put the old versions on the web as an album.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although grammar and spelling are often "smooth" at the beginning of blogging, it tends to change for the better with the presence of an audience.
Since students are usually the most picky audience, a blogger does everything possible to improve his style to avoid criticism.
Besides, blogging helps students better understand the world around them. The need to keep the audience curious inspires them and forces them to remain competent and curious (Tota, 2004).
Blogging encourages collaboration and encourages students to learn much more than the traditional school approach.
If students use blogs properly, they can develop analytical and critical thinking skills; active reaction to Internet materials will help students define their own position on what other people have written, as well as express their own views on individual issues (Oraвец, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating and charming bilingual capital, home to numerous art galleries and museums that offer a glimpse into the country's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, and Lake Muscoco lies to the north, famous for its pristine natural beauty.
For this and many other reasons, tourists, visitors, and other foreigners consider Ontario to be a typical Canadian province.
Much of its territory, further north, is sparsely populated, and some is almost entirely desert.
And here's a surprising fact to compare population: The number of African Americans in the United States is greater than the total population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located off the eastern coast of Africa and are part of the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest of them all, and when it comes to wildlife, it's a continent apart.
Almost all of the smaller islands are either independent states or belong to France, and they are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
Also, the Arabs brought Islam with them to these lands, and the religion quickly spread to the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
It wasn't until the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope to India, that European influence and colonialism began.
The northern border of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western border is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female tourists are advised to always say they are married, even if they are not.
It may also be helpful to wear a ring (so that it does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand that because of cultural differences, they may face behavior that seems unusual, and that locals may often annoy tourists, hold hands, and so on.
Say no to men and stand up for yourself (culturally, it's totally unacceptable!)
Modern-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used the city as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it as Casa Branca (White House), but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Baja, after the Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
In all of Morocco Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Near the Old City of Medina, you can quickly find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as leather goods, pottery, tacos, necklaces, and various toys, but all of them are exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo near the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma swept away the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, burying much of the city's streets, mostly in the city center.
Although the city of Goma is safe enough, to get outside it, you need to do a little investigation to find out if there is fighting in North Kivu province at any given time.
The city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and offers very cheap services for gorilla-watching enthusiasts - more attractive prices in Africa are hard to come by.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda boda (motorcycle taxi), which costs around 500 Congolese francs (USD) for a short trip.
As a result of Timbuktu's relative inaccessibility, its name began to be used as a metaphor for distant exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and the presence of an airport, today Timbuktu  is a city of poverty.
In 1990, due to the threat of sand dunes, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
Henry Louis Gates paid a lot of attention to this city in the PBS program "Wonders of the African Continent".
Compared to the rest of the country, it's even more distinctive because it's more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River runs along its southern border.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2. It has 14 eczones, each of which is home to different animals and plants.
It is one of the country's most interesting places, and is also considered the most significant of South Africa's national parks.
Like all South African national parks, the park charges an entrance fee and collects an environmental levy on visitors.
In addition, it may be beneficial to purchase a so-called Wild Card  subscription, which gives you the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all the national parks of South Africa.
The country's name Hong Kong is borrowed from Hong Kong Island, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's beautiful buildings form the architectural landscape of the city, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only underscore its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong are to be seen from the island and headed to the opposite coastal city of Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coast on dry land.
This place was occupied by British colonists in the past, so if you want to see evidence of a country's colonial past, this is the place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and into the interior of India.
UNESCO has declared Sundarbans as a World Heritage Site. The name Sundarbans National Park is given to the part of the forest that is in India.
It's not just the mangrove swamps that are called forests, it's also some of the last remaining jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain and is still there.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is occupied by watersheds or bogs.
Sundarbans Forest has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and today, 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer are reported to be in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (which is across the river) throughout the day, but in most cases they depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakarta (which is in the Bumtang district).
Because of the frequent crowding of interurban buses, tickets are recommended to be purchased a couple of days before the trip.
The comfortable and reliable Japanese Coaster minibuses serve most areas.
A taxi is a comfortable and convenient way to get to places nearby, such as Punakha (cost of 200 ngultrum) and Paro (cost of 150 ngultrum).
The bridge that crosses the Ayapoque is a vaulted bridge that connects the banks of the Ayapoque River, which spans the two cities of Ayapoque (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-Luapoque (French Guiana).
The bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes, each 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres.The bridge was opened to traffic only in March 2017, although its construction was completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully functional in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani, who led a life of wolf-hunting and also engaged in natural agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous people who inhabited the territory of modern-day Eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous groups, such as the Payagua and the Guaycurus, lived in the Chaco region, and they hunted, fished, and gathered to survive.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", actually came into being in the 16th century when Spanish conquistadors encountered the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a 300-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
At other times of the year, you can watch tournaments and smaller-scale matches.
Information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is worth as much as the British pound (GBP).
In the Falkland Islands, currency can only be exchanged at the only bank in the entire country, located in Port Stanley across from the F.I.C. West.
British pounds are generally accepted as payment anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted at Stanley.
The remote islands probably won't accept credit cards, but they might accept British or American cash; ask the owners in advance what their payment method is.
It's practically impossible to exchange local currency outside the Falkland Islands, so do it before you leave.
If it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, Montevideo is summer, and vice versa, because it's south of the equator.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30°C in the summer months are common.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: thermometer poles often drop below zero, but because of the wind combined with humidity, the temperature feels lower than it really is.
The rainfall is almost constant throughout the year, so there are no specific rainy or dry seasons.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, there is no need to feed or disturb them  wild animals remain wild.
Park officials advise keeping bears and wolves at a distance of at least 100 yards (meters) and other wildlife  25 yards (meters)!
Zebras, moose, raccoon, bear and almost all large animals are capable of going on the attack, no matter how obedient they may seem.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because of the lack of proper distance, so stay away, because these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Bear in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so do not wear or cook food with strong odors, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city of just under 40,000 people on the island of Upolu.
Apia has been in existence since the 1850s, and since 1959 it has been the official capital of Samoa.
In 1889, the harbor became the site of a notorious naval confrontation when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British cruiser sank, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
The assassination of Tupou's supreme leader, Thomas Lealofi III, ended a peaceful rally in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
Because of the harbors on either side of Auckland, there are a lot of beaches, and the most popular ones are in three different areas.
The North Shore beaches are located near North Harbor and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south along the Pacific coast.
Almost all the beaches here are sandy, it's a safe place to swim, and most of them are shaded by trees halfway.
In the elite suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers (the central district of Auckland) in the Waitemont Harbour are the Tamaki Drive beaches.
It's another crowded family beach with lots of shops.
The main local beer is known to customers as "Number One". This drink is simple, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is "Manta".
You can try a variety of French wines, but you'd better pick up wines from Australia and New Zealand.
Local tap water is absolutely safe and safe to drink, but if you have some precautions, finding bottled water is not a problem.
The idea of Flat White coffee is foreign to Australians. Espresso is a small portion of black coffee, the cappuccino is filled with cream instead of penny, the tea is brewed without milk.
Hot chocolate is exactly like Belgium, and the fruit juices are pretty expensive, but they taste great.
Reef trips take place year-round and in large numbers, but injuries and injuries for any of the reasons mentioned occur rarely.
However, we advise you to follow the advice of the authorities, comply with all requirements, and carefully follow safety warnings.
Cuban jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and near river beds north of the settlement of 1770. Occasionally they can be seen outside this period.
Sharks are here, but they rarely attack humans, so most people avoid them and swim away from them.
Rattlesnakes are found mostly in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, not in the ocean.
Booking in advance allows travelers to be comfortable with where they'll stay when they arrive at their destination.
Often travel agents deal with specific hotels, but you may be able to book other accommodations through a travel agent, such as camping spots.
Usually travel agents offer packages of services that include breakfast, airport transfer and return, or even combined packages with airfare and hotel accommodation.
In addition, if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain any other documents (such as a visa) that you need to get to your destination, the tour agent can hold your reservation.
It is recommended that you send your suggestions for changes in terms or inquiries to the tour agent, not directly to the hotel.
The vast majority of people who come to music festivals choose to stay on the scene, and most of them say it's an incredibly important experience.
You'll have to come early if you want to find a camping spot near the music venue.
Remember, even if the main stages are finished, there may still be sections of the festival where the music will play until midnight.
At some festivals, families with small children can enjoy special camping.
I recommend checking your cabin location when crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter. The passage through the ice-caps can be accompanied by a terrible noise and crack, to which people with heightened sensory sensitivity are particularly sensitive.
The cruise program in the direction of St. Petersburg includes a stay in the city. Passengers of these cruises do not need a visa (please read the terms and conditions).
Usually, casinos make a lot of effort to ensure that guests spend as much time and spend as much money as possible, because they lack windows and watches, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment, all of which are designed to keep guests in a good mood and not want to leave the casino.
In some places, alcohol is served on the premises, but all the great players know the importance of keeping sober, because drunkenness interferes with clear thinking.
Snow, hail, and negative temperatures are things that anyone who is going to visit the northern latitudes or cross mountain passes should consider.
The friction coefficient on snow-covered and ice-covered roads is low, so you can't drive like you're riding on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you get stuck.
In addition, visibility may be limited by snowfall or a swirl or frostbite or condensation of moisture on the car's windows.

The most popular tourist entertainment in Africa  is perhaps safari, for many tourists it is the most interesting moment.
In common usage, the term safari refers to a journey by land, particularly across the savannah, where you can see the beautiful African wildlife.
Usually, individual animals, including  giraffes and elephants, are close to cars, and good visibility can be guaranteed even by standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are best viewed through binoculars, because they can be very cautious.
A trek that takes several hours, or even days, is called a roaming safari, also known as a bushwalk, hiking safari, or footing safari.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with individual competitions taking place at different venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice  the first time they were held here in 1964.

You can try using a fan if you don't have any soot or if you don't want to wear soot socks.
Try not to overheat the fabric (which may cause it to become engorged or even, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, and some of them are more effective against specific threats.
Some places boil water in just one minute, while others require several minutes.
Filters have different efficiency, so if you're in doubt, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter pests of animal origin that are not typical of their native region.
Pests can cause irritation (and in the worst cases, even allergic reactions), spread poisons and infections, and spoil food.
Pests are not usually considered to be infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are not subject to taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Tourists who travel to countries with high taxes can often save money, especially on goods such as tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
The most difficult traffic conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway are between Point Marion and Fairmont, where the road often goes through a deafening wall.
If you're not experienced on city roads, always be alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes, and unexpected turns.
The existing speed limits are noticeably lower than the previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is very important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, the cell signal here is much stronger than on many other stretches of the road, like the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, but in Bavaria, like its southern neighbor Austria, they are quite rich and varied.
Fruit flour products are widely used, which are added to apples all year round, and in summer, in addition, cherries and plums.
A lot of German baking is found in fondue, almonds, and other nuts. A fairly strong coffee is a good partner for popular pies.
If you're looking for a small, but high-calorie cake, try what's called a berliner, a pancake, or a krapfen, depending on the region.
A kari is a dish of meat or vegetables, seasoned with herbs and spices.

In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to the bark, while in southern India and some other coastal areas, it is simply coconut milk.
Indonesian food is cooked on 17,000 islands, and it's important to note that Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
However, in the absence of further clarification, the term most often refers to dishes that originate from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Today, the cuisine of Java is widely available throughout the archipelago, with a wide variety of spicy dishes and spices, such as nuts, red chili peppers, sugar (primarily coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The strands hang from both sides of the saddle and are supports for the rider's feet.
They give the rider more stability, but they can cause safety problems because the rider's legs can get stuck.
If a rider falls off his horse, his foot may get caught in the saddle, and if the horse falls and runs away, he may pull the rider behind him, and to minimize the risk, some safety measures can be taken.
First, the special heels and soft, rather narrow soles are worn by most riders.
In addition, some saddles, especially English, have protective arches, which allow the rider to fall off the saddle when he pulls the strap back.
In the Cochama Valley, Chile's premier mountaineering destination, known as the South American Yosemite, there are a large number of large granite cliffs and obstacles.
Exciting views are revealed from the mountain tops, and climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes through the endless maze of rocks.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered surfaces on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
For many ski enthusiasts, skiing is their main activity on the road, sometimes called skiing enthusiasts. They can spend their entire holiday skiing in a certain place.
People have been skiing since ancient times. Rock paintings of skiers' skis date to about 5000 B.C.
Somewhere in the 17th century, the history of mountain skiing as a sport began, and in 1861 the Norwegians already opened the first sports-health ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism: this is called skiing in remote areas, ski hiking or skiing.
It is similar to alpine-style skiing or alpinism, but usually does not include them. The latter are practiced on steep terrain and require much more solid skis and shoes.
Compare a ski run with a similar hiking trail.
Under the right conditions, you can go a little further than if you were walking, but you rarely get the same speed as skiing on a paved trail without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, yet it contains many independent countries. Normally, traveling to several countries means that tourists and travelers have to repeatedly pass passport checks and apply for visas.
At the same time, the Schengen area is the only country that works in this regard.
You can usually cross the border without going through the passport checkpoints again while you are in this zone.
Similarly, if you already have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen country, which saves you time, money, and simplifies the paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax authorities define an antique as a product that was manufactured more than 100 years ago.
The concept of antiquity has some geographical differences, for example, in North America the age of a thing to be considered antique is less than in Europe.
Craft goods can be called antiques, although they are less old than similar mass-produced goods.
The Sami consider cattle farming to be an important means of subsistence, and the culture of trade that accompanies it is of great importance to people of other professions.
However, even traditional cattle herding was not practiced by all the Saami, many of whom lived by fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, and deer were used primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people have advanced professions, and tourism is a major source of income in Lapland, where the Sami live.
Despite its widespread use, especially among other peoples, the word gypsy is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and a mistaken image of the Roma.
If a country you plan to visit is warned about the danger or unwantedness of traveling there, this may affect the conditions of the travel health insurance or the cancellation of the travel insurance.
You can also take advice from other governments, not your own, but their advice is designed for the citizens of their country.
So, for example, compared to Europeans or Arabs, U.S. citizens may face different situations when they're in the Middle East.
The recommendations and warnings about the dangers are just a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
They often express general, superficial, and simplified views, especially when compared with more detailed information that can be obtained from other sources.
Extreme weather is a general term for dangerous weather events that can cause damage, disrupt public life, or lead to human casualties.
Weather can be harsh anywhere in the world, and depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions, natural disasters can take many forms.
Among the various forms and effects of extreme weather conditions are not only strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires, but also tornadoes, cyclones, hailstorms and water storms.
Thunderstorms, snowstorms, hailstorms, and dust storms are all regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travelers are strongly advised to keep up-to-date with any possible severe weather conditions in their area, as this will affect their planned trips.
Anyone planning to visit a country where hostilities may be taking place should undergo appropriate professional training.
Maybe if you search for "Aggressive Environmental Training", you'll find the address of a local business.

Tourists who plan to undergo sex-change surgery abroad must have the proper documents with them to return home.
Different governments are willing to issue passports with an unknown gender (X) or to change documents to match the desired name and gender.
Foreign governments are willing to enforce these documents in very different ways.
In addition, after September 11, 2001, surveillance at checkpoints became much more brutal.
It's hardly expected that transsexuals who haven't had surgery will be able to pass the scan without compromising their dignity and privacy.
The recoil current, often seen on reefs or similar places, is the backflow of waves that are drifting away from the beach.
The backflow is concentrated in a few areas with a lot of depth, which is related to the underwater topology, and there you can create a fast flow to a lot of depth.
Most fatalities are caused by fatigue when people try to swim back to shore against the tide, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, it's not going to be hard to come back.
Try to head where you won't get back in the flow, or if your skills allow it, or if you're spotted, you can stay put and wait for rescue.
Because the honeymoon is shorter, the shock of coming home can come sooner than the culture shock, and it can be more severe and last longer.
For travelers who have never had a problem adjusting to a new culture, it can be very difficult to adjust again to the culture of their homeland.
People who return home after spending a long time abroad have already adjusted to the culture of the new country, and they have lost some of the habits they once learned in their native culture.
When you first visited a foreign country, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that it takes time to adapt.
Many people don't expect the same understanding and patience from those travelers who are returning home.
One of the activities that your kids might be most interested in is the sound and light show that takes place around the pyramids.
Darkness and silence overwhelm the pyramids before the show begins.
The story of light and sound is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx serves as a decoration and serves as the narrator of a long story.
The pyramids serve as a storytelling screen, and different pyramids are occasionally highlighted.
Several states claim the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and which are home to the largest number of bases, with 16 still operating in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km (120 mi) north of the peninsula, and the largest island is called King George, and it is home to the hamlet of Villa Los Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston and Deception, where a picturesque natural harbor was formed in the crater of an active volcano.
The lands of Ellsworth, bounded by the sea of Bellingshausen, are located to the south of the peninsula.
At this point, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, and then they rise back out of it, forming the 200-mile-long Ellsworth Range, which is cut in half by the Minnesota glacier.
The highest mountain range in Antarctica is Mount Vinson, which rises to 4,892 m (14,980 ft) in the northern part of the Sentinel Ridge.
A satellite phone may be your only option when you're in a remote area where your cellular network is down.
Usually, satellite phones don't replace cell phones, because you have to be out in the street and see the satellite directly to make a call.
It's a service that shipping companies use frequently, including cruise ships and expeditions that require data and voice communications.
You can find out more about how to connect to this service from your local telephone service provider.
The option of combining study and travel is gaining popularity among those planning their academic vacation.
This option is especially popular among high school graduates, because it allows them to take an academic break before entering university without compromising their knowledge.
In fact, in many cases, a year of study abroad can improve your chances of getting into a university or college in your own country.
These programs are usually paid for.
Finland is one of the best places to go rowing or boating. In addition, there are thousands of lakes and islands in the country, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
Lakes and archipelagos are navigable without a boat.
While the largest lakes and coastal archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even boats can give you a completely different experience.
In Finland, boat-skating is a national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
We see similar things in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but nowhere else (for example, in Holland, it's one to forty).
For most memorable cruises around the Baltic Sea, a long stopover in Russia's St. Petersburg is typical.
That means that for a few full days, you can walk around the historic part of town, returning to the ship's berth.
You will not need a separate visa if you are going to go to the coast only for boat trips (information as of 2009).
Some cruise ships offer a visit to Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. However, if you look at the map, you can see that Berlin is far from the sea. Also, the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
For people of any age and background, flying can be a terrifying experience, especially if they've never flown before or have experienced a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of. It's the same fear that many people have, like other personal fears or dislike of certain things.
For some, it can help to overcome the fear of the unknown or the fear of losing control by understanding how planes are designed and what happens during flight.
Courier services are well paid for delivering things quickly, and in many cases, when delivering business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs, time is of the essence.
The big companies have their own planes on some routes, but when it comes to other routes and not so big companies, there was a problem.
If the goods were shipped by air, it might take days for some routes to unload and customs.
Checked baggage was the only way to get the cargo faster, and airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to get into first or business class is to put a lot of money into it (and even better, have a company do it for you).
But it's not cheap: practice shows that compared to the standard economy class you can pay four times more for business class and more than eleven times for first class!
Basically, there's no point in looking for discounts on direct flights from A to B in first or business class.
The airlines are well aware that there is a key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum price for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, so they charge a fee accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is the city of Kishinev. The local population speaks Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic country with ethnic conflict.
As a result of this conflict, the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic was established in eastern Moldova in 1994. It has its own government and currency, but no EU member state recognizes it.
Economic ties were restored between the two parts of Moldova, despite the fact that political negotiations had failed.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, and is a very good transport hub and the second largest port after Istanbul.
The ancient city of Smyrna, located by a vast bay in the mountains, is now a modern, thriving commercial center.

We also recommend visiting the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Holy Place), known worldwide for having seen the ghost of the Virgin Mary here repeatedly.
Remember, you're essentially at a mass burial site, which means a lot to a lot of people in the world that is simply beyond words.
And in our day, there are still many men and women who have had to survive here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or who worked here -- both Jews and Gentiles.
We ask that you treat this place with all the seriousness and respect it deserves, and not make jokes about the Nazis or the Holocaust.
Don't damage this place. Don't write or draw graffiti anywhere.
Barcelona has two official languages, Spanish and Catalan, and about half of the population prefers Catalan, which most people understand, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
At the same time, most of the signs are in Catalan, which is the official language according to the law.

The usual announcements in the metro are in Catalan only, but announcements of sudden interruptions in work are made through an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Japanese and Arabic.
Parisians are often described as rude, self-centered, and proud.
While this is often a misconception, when in Paris, it's best to show your best manners and be bien élevé, which will make it easier to move around the city.

The vast area of the Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with forest, and is home to a mix of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
Because of the wide range of microclimates, varied soil types, and varying altitudes above sea level, many plant communities can be found here.

In addition to various common species, this place is home to rare animals such as the European bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and deer.
Women who attend monasteries must wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries do offer jewelry to women who don't know about these requirements, but if you bring your own, especially if it's in bright colors, the nuns at the entrance will be very pleased.
A similar requirement applies to men - they must wear pants below the knee.
You can also borrow them from the store at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after every guest, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing these skirts.
As in the case of many other Mediterranean cuisines, the cuisine of Mauritius is characterized by dishes made from vegetables, bread and meat (mainly pork), and all dishes are added with olive oil.
A simple and popular dish, especially in summer, is called Pa-amb-Oli. It includes bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any spices that are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Even when they're in the middle of a sentence, all nouns, like the pronoun Sie (that is, you), start with a capital letter.
This method always distinguishes verbs from nouns that denote objects.
It may also make reading easier, but it makes writing a little bit more difficult because you have to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in substantive form.
Most Italian words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled, so the pronunciation is hardly difficult.
The main attention should be paid to the letters c and g, because their pronunciation depends on the next vowel.
The consonants r and rr are pronounced differently: caro is translated as dargi, while carro is rolla.

However, people who speak a little Spanish may make a hasty conclusion that Portuguese is similar to it and therefore does not require separate study.
Today, modern observatories are generally obsolete and serve as museums or learning centers.
These observatories were usually located in cities or on university campuses, where they were easier to get to than modern observatories, and the reason is simple: today, light pollution is a much bigger problem than it was in the past.
Most modern research telescopes are large objects of enormous size, usually located in peripheral regions with optimal atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, which means love of cherry blossoms, was introduced into Japanese culture in the 8th century.
The origin of this concept is thought to be China, where plum blossoms were a favorite.
The first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor of Japan only for himself and other court aristocrats.

On Easter night, there is a tradition not to sleep, but to stay somewhere in the open to meet the rising sun.
In Christianity, of course, there are certain theological explanations for this tradition, but it can be simply a ritual of fertility and the arrival of spring.
Easter services are usually held by more traditional churches on Saturday evening on Easter weekend, and parishioners often begin the celebrations at midnight, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands either reached them or fled.
The giant tortoise became the main animal of the Galapagos, because the great distance between the island and the mainland prevented mammals from migrating.
Many mammals have appeared in the Galápagos since the arrival of humans, including goats, horses, cows, cats, dogs, and rats.
You can get a taste of the polar night if you go to the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, when the sun doesn't rise at all over the horizon.
