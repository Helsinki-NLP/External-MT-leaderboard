A black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find money to repair a crashing highway network, many are starting to see a solution in a small black box that will easily fit into your car’s dashboard.
The devices that track every mile a driver runs and transmit this information to authorities are at the heart of Washington’s controversial efforts and government planning agencies to renovate the outdated financing system for American major roads.
Usually, the fading design of highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of ecologists and lobbied for the government to use these small boxes to record miles and where you are going – and then use this information to compile a tax bill.
The Tea Party is scary.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can’t agree on whether to continue, some states don’t expect anything.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for the mile of the road he runs.
Thousands of drivers have already tested black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It’s not a matter of choosing power,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of State Governments, which plans to start tracking kilometers for every California driver by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology serves.
The incentive is the fact that a road trust fund funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations is at the bottom.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a single cent.
“A gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed tracking devices in 500 cars to test this kilometer-payment system.
“In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers traveled.
It’s no surprise that this idea is liked by urbanist liberals, as taxes can be used to change drivers’ patterns of behavior, which, for example, can help limit traffic congestion and greenhouse gas generation.
California designers look at this system when planning strategies to meet the targets set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation’s free-market representatives are also inclined to the idea that drivers will pay for the miles taken.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards paying per kilometer.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives’ leadership rejected the proposal and did so because of concerns from rural lawmakers representing components of the population, whose daily life often means offending many kilometers for working outside the city.
However, several states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The most fervent is Oregon, which involved 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying a mileage tax to the state instead of a gasoline tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently working on the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transportation, along with the coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept has no advocates.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government is able to track every movement.
“The concerns about Big Brother tracking and similar matters have been a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategy and operation management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It was not what people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build an enormous, heavy-duty technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers a car travels, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be quieter.
The hunt for such a technology has brought some state agencies to a small California company called True Mileage (real traveled distance).
This company was initially not involved in the action to help the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging legal liability insurance market, where drivers would be paid based on how much they drive.
But this device, which it tries, attracts the attention of road network designers because it doesn’t use GPS and only delivers a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go if you don’t track their speed and location,” says Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have occurred in some of these pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they don’t need to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat rate based on the average number of miles travelled by all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, they hope that a cautious public will approach this concept if the equipment is able to do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax device that would be equipped to pay extra fees for parking hours, to provide insurance based on kilometers and to collect speed data from other drivers, so drivers can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits they are offered,” the city’s project document states.
However, some transportation designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometer are not just a giant representative issue.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund very simply by raising gasoline taxes.
A one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for any radical surgery when it’s enough to take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the legislative and public affairs committee.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating.
Social democracy is running, the people and the babysitters are talking together and preparing a joint action.
If within a few weeks the Social Democrats fail, they will sit at a negotiating table with perfectly prepared partners, who will put on the table a ready-made list of demands including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD emissaries will then either swallow the acid coalition grapes, or chew on a crumbling minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka after four days, when he carried on a wave of sympathy, struck for the first time.
Yesterday he failed to control the political grassroots and especially to force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only he, the other members of the team will be allowed only after a key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologized to the members of the Gremio and now also to the citizens.
No lies, neither in public nor in private.
“It was a mistake,” said Michal Hašek, the closest leader of Social Democracy.
He added that he is not in the position of Prime Minister.
“I will announce my decision on the 10th of November,” Hašek said.
Similarly spoke the deputy chairman of ČSSD Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the parliamentary club Jeroným Tejc.
He said he was elected two days ago.
Both members said they would do everything they can to ensure that the 50 members of the CHSSD club sounded with one vote.
In his speech to the Absurd Theatre, Hašek said: “I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and respected the decisions of the party bodies.”
Another story in direct transmission.
Or,, when calling for Sobotkov’s resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August U.S.V. with 57 percent of votes decided that Bohuslav Sobotka is the party’s candidate for prime minister?
The Chief of the ČSSD, however, by convening the ÚVV only next Sunday produced a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of the body and the media with a bunch of all sorts of gossip and rumors, eventually reminding of the real mistakes of Sobotkov’s political career.
Dirty clothes will be washed, signs of dark alliances will appear between the baron Zdeňek Bakala and the Sobotkov wing.
It will be discussed the friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorny.
There are disputes in the Moravian or Moravian organizations of ČSSD.
Ostrava’s mayor and Sobotk’s ally, Peter Kainar, said: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots.”
If the UAV met this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
Traitors will sweep their heads with ashes and stay.
And now the winning Chief of the ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on problems with the Olympics in Sochi: Communication with Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile and then just take a deep breath: “It’s hard.”
Cooperation with the organizing team of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We have forgotten what happened at the Olympics.
“Nothing works the same,” said the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What is happening specifically?
Many things work so slowly and not so accurately.
It is so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of delivering information on essential things, not so much.
For example, for three months, we’ve liked them to provide us with how the individual villages will be officially designated, so that we can do a variety of things accordingly.
We are still waiting and they are still saying they are communicating the matter.
They always communicate on a lot of things.
Has the Olympic Village been built?
This is no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago we walked around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they are empty?
Do you need ready floors?
This is just the baseline, that’s how it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there is a danger that we will come there on January 26 as a leader, there will still be a sense of glue there.
And if they didn’t go, what would happen?
Do you think President Putin is going to go to the army?
This is exactly how it will happen.
The Olympic Village is the Olympic Village of Potemkin.
It is more likely that they will not, for example, modify the roads, do not complete the details.
Maybe they’ll have roads in such a state that we’ll have to take the sweaters from the London Games with us.
But I think they will get it somehow.
How many athletes can go to Sochi?
Now there are approximately 78, although this number varies depending on the nomination criteria.
Per the crocodiles will go in the three that they went out of.
No one has any doubts about Martin Sáblíkov, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you on your way to Sochi?
If nothing happens, I should be there until January 26.
How the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things with meters, so that we couldn’t just believe the sketches.
We do a lot of things, including transportation.
And what does the head of mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports and I am working on a regular agenda in the sense of communicating with the organising committee in Sochi.
Putin pledged an ecological Olympics, plan threatens giant secret landfills
Fans of winter sports are already cutting a meter to the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others look at their preparation with increasing concerns.
The Russian Olympics, which will only begin in February, are facing a new scandal.
The Russians seem to fail to fulfill the promise that the preparations and holding of the games will not disturb the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After all, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had the latte built very high, the Canadian Games have entered into the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s commitment to organizing games with “zero waste” seems to have long since taken for granted.
AP reporters last week discovered a giant landfill of building materials in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foams was found in August by ecologists, which they immediately.
The Russian authorities were bursting and the landfill disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters were given a look at a landfill of the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, in the area there have been several such places, described the British newspaper The Times.
The site is being operated by the Russian Railways, a state monopoly that builds a roughly sixty-kilometre route between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways defended that the landfill was founded by someone from subcontractors.
The locals are now desperate.
According to the residents of Achstyr, trucks full of waste materials have been driving around the village for three months, day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu river, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
“Water from here will contaminate Sochi’s water springs for the next ten to fifteen years,” Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental non-profit organization EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison, the games in Sochi will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing came out at $43 billion.
Last year, the Olympics in London cost only 19 billion and the Vancouver Games 9 billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and fears that there will eventually be enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working on sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers struck his mouth in protest that he hadn’t been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are dealing with the new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gay at the Olympics.
Young couple mature to live with their parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was commissioned to design a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the plot itself somewhat swinging.
The demand also stated that two generations would want to live together in the house, but each should have its own clearly separate space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly bending plot.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
“When creating the design, we respected family ties, history and memories connected with the place.”
“Three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the building, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy,” the designers explain.
The household of the parents is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are bound.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable already from the outside, because they differ in the various final modifications of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been painted using board panels, the part where the office is plastered white and the remaining elements have remained in a pure concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very connected with the exterior.
The household of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is emphasized by the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
A kitchen in a young couple’s home.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climbs the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main element of the interior.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to pass through them.
It was in this way that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique to it.
The household of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace it is separated only by a glass wall with a sliding door.
Living area with dining and kitchen in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black colors.
The staircase is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house by the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and then climbs up the stairs from there.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly urged students, teachers and high school and university leaders in several counties to defend academic freedom from the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman in the schools.
I have had more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the lecture of the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received retaliation for this in the form of not being invited to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer so brave and made the visit of Miloš Zeman possible: Higher Technical Learning in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, Higher School of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
At the moment, we are meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of policy enforcement in universities.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and, in addition, it seems normal to him.
This is not the same as being the mayor of a small town.
Do you want to be among the heads of the ČSSD, who simultaneously perform the functions of a deputy and a header and like them degrade both professions?
This is because you tell people that you can handle both of these challenging functions with the left back.
I know, we have an example of Michal Hasko, who manages even several dozen functions at once.
But this is probably not exactly the example of the person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňkové, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post in order to fully devote herself to the management of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean’s position, however, is that during the course of your duties you will violate the apolitics of the university of Pardubice.
The management of the pardubic ODS sees your current work in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help "your" school without remaining a dean.
I think that the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig, will have your students.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that voters will count on you in the next elections.
It may not have a long duration.
In Kunovic, bubble cabbage, chemistry is not added to it
More than 1,000 tons of sour cabbage will be produced in the coming months in the Slovak Fruit Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started in October and will last about six months.
Healthy delicacies have been produced here since 1925 still in the traditional way, i.e. by tapping directly in big dances.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our employees will take a 10km route for the change.
Each of the ten tanks will fit fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said the director of the Slovak Fruta plant David Kladroba.
Cabbage heads are carried to the company's site directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrozhsk and Břeclavsk.
Fruit employees then clean the vegetables, remove the baskets and throw them into the ring.
From there, the already cut cabbage falls into swimming pools of six meters in depth, in which puppets dressed in white clothes and clothes work tirelessly.
This eliminates unwanted air.
The last layer of cabbage is covered with a saucer and loaded with water.
“The green crochet then ripens for six to eight weeks with spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation-supporting substances,” Kladroba said.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, the individual layers are poured with salt and shrimp.
After coughing, it goes to the filling line.
It is packed in sweet-acid infusion into bags or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage primarily to the domestic and Slovak market.
Interest is also registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "co-operate" with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence agent, has said he is ready to go to Berlin to deliver evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and talked with him about the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, which Mr. Snowden delivered to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Al the outcome of my efforts has been proven positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as a conspiracy and tries to criminalize political speech with heavy charges that leave no room for defence.”
Speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said he believes that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to withdraw the criminal charges filed against him.
The allegations raised by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to rise after allegations appeared that the NSA was intercepting Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who leads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said if there was any opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting himself at risk and completely destroying relations with the United States,” it should be done.
Mr. Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter post.
He was accompanied by two German journalists on his trip to Russia.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract attorney, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe” there, a member of parliament said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign associated with persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world’s reaction to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens all over the world and senior officials – including those in the United States – have evaluated the unjustified disclosure of a system of ubiquitous surveillance for the service of the public.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are solved.”
We are sorry for the killing, but we are innocent, the Red Khmer leaders defend themselves
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
During the Khmer Rouge rule, which relied on a mixture of maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population, died as a result of exhaustion, hunger, illness, torture and executions.
The commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charged with genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea what the actual scope of the killing was.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything, and thus intervene and correct the situation," Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think that I wanted this to happen to My people?
The reality is that I didn’t have any authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres to “misbehave or kill people, deny them food or commit genocide.”
But he acknowledged “moral responsibility” for the dead.
“I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, the whole Cambodian people,” he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che's apology.
“He lied to us.”
“He wants to be released from guilt.”
“He doesn’t care about the other,” she said.
“If he didn’t give orders, his subordinates’t be killed,” she said, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were “worse than monsters.”
Earlier in the year, Ieng Sary, the Khmer Rouge’s foreign minister, died in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incapable of trial in September 2012 due to dementia.
The Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although they said in their Wednesday announcement that passengers will be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage fee applies to the upper storage baggage, so small luggage underneath the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers with the payment wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the stallion fee is meant to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge that charge,” she said.
Airlines started charging first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers sought to avoid these charges and put themselves in the hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so that there was often no space in that space.
Taxes are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O’Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to get more money.
The point is that the most loyal customers of Frontier have made it quite clear that finding a place in the top storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in a row at the Frontier gate can bring luggage for which they will pay nothing, while the other passenger in a row will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O’Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure passengers are aware of the fee before they arrive at the gate.
The new Frontier charge for hand luggage will not be valid before the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the extra baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
Most of them did not pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, followed her example later.
The only company that also has such charges is Hungarian Wizz Air, says airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage fee would generate $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former senior manager at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit, wondering what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit’s unusual charge for hand luggage.
“Staying on a plane was the most fluid thing I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I was expecting to see the brushing of teeth and quarrelling at the door.
The plane was full, he said, “and the take-off took place in a moment.”
According to Spirit, Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said passengers who get a limonade or juice can keep a whole can and the coffee will be refilled for free.
Water will continue to be provided for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to impose drinks charges in 2008, but after complaints from passengers seven months later withdrew from it, and no other major airline imitated it.
Frontier’s last move to charge hand luggage, unless passengers purchase a flight directly from this airline, is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel dealers such as Orbitz between $10 and $25 per ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to buy directly from them, rather than through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the longest in this area.
In September, it started giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the mile reward to 25 percent of the mile.
So a 1,000-mile journey with Frontier purchased through an online travel agency means a 250-mile reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and losing money.
According to the financial results on Wednesday by the corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by 13 percent in the first quarter.
With the sale of the airline, Republic is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
The NSA doesn’t blame hackers for the crash, it’s an “internal mistake”
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its website fell for several hours last week due to an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some claimed on the internet.
“The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update,” the agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server scanners noticed that the NSA website had been out of service for at least six hours, and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were “not at all” threatened.
The spokesman said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hacking activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for dismantling the NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target web pages with information until the servers get overcrowded and the page drops.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, once nicknamed No such agency, has become the focus of public attention in recent months after the revelation of foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and the target of biting criticism – a combined product of the stealing of secret NSA files from the agency and their disclosure by the disappointed former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency sparked earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profits declined due to falling supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier on Thursday a 15% decline in net profit due to lower aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in the train unit.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also did not publish any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide up-to-date information as to whether the aircraft will adhere to its ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is progressing well.
The results failed to meet the estimates and the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8 percent.
State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen lowered Thursday’s rating from “higher profitability” to “sector performance” with expectations that the stock market will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While we generally expected smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margins in the transport sector disappointed us significantly,” Doerksen said in a customer report.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that market skepticism towards this program will rise.
Bombardier hopes CSeries aircraft will break into the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and, after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of mandatory CSeries aircraft orders reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the test flight results to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 mandatory orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
Leaders also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing as planned.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft’s stop.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on upgrades and we did that.
This will take place throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks and the rest shortly thereafter.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – although in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to strengthen our belief that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
From $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share in the third quarter ending September 30.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dropped marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’s IBES system, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter, up from 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which remains unchanged as of December 31.
“Results in aviation were consistent with our outlook, but we were disappointed by low order revenue and the overall market situation,” said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said revenue in this division grew by 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to 32.6 billion as of 30 September, a marginal increase from 31 December.
The profit margin in the transportation division was affected by difficulties with implementing several major contracts.
Leaders said new outlook will be provided in the fourth quarter.
The stock of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google’s Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette, fell by 8.5 percent during Thursday afternoon trading to $4.83.
Embraer, Brazil’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and nearest competitor to Bombardier, a decrease of 10 percent in quarterly profits on Thursday.
Cocaine addicted lawyer who warned mafia against police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass information to the King of the Underground, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The top lawyer who informed the drug mafia about a large police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light was sentenced to three years in prison.
After Basharat Ditta (42) became suspected of cocaine use, he had to pass sensitive information on his drug smuggling activities to the boss of the underworld Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer, whose nickname was “Bash” (party) and who was celebrated by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he represented in previous drug-related proceedings.
Police saw Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular class A drug user.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he sought to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were then monitored as part of a large-scale investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized heroin and cocaine worth approximately £1.5 million along with £200,000 in cash during a series of raids, 32 others ended up in jail along with them.
Ditta (42) passed information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction could be discovered.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors based in Blackburn, has experienced shameful moments before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During the hearing, he admitted to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer’s fall came after a police investigation revealed that Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives watched the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house and saw him placing drugs of 60 percent purity under the lawyer's basket in a black golf gloves.
Subsequently, Scarborough was in a regular telephone conversation with Ditt, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two persons.
The court said traces of class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation falls into “confidential communication.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but all were detained and samples of his hair were taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated an office both at his home address and at his workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted key players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives know about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware of not breaking the law than a criminal attorney.”
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we are talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it goes far beyond the ordinary client-lawyer relationship.
The police investigation was scrapped as much as they could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He got too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta rejected the offence and declared, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After the hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal from a criminal attorney when he began to obtain drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading organized crime groups who have given him the task of collecting valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and should inspire public trust and the feeling that they can be trusted.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the mantle of his profession.
The Lancashire Crime and Organized Crime Unit conducted an investigation against Mr. Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now of obstructing justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We will find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another 35 people involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death toll block in America, as a guest at dinner he would like Muhammad Ali, and as a motivation for work he mentioned inequality.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasala sent against Babiš.
The People’s Party won 14 seats in the elections, which is only one-third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they are entering government negotiations with at least one advantage.
The team, which has already begun to discuss the outlines of a possible coalition, has Jana Kasala - a man who, under the people's rule, laid the conditions for government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
Per this time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how the talks will develop this year.
Kenya press outraged by controversial media law
“It’s a terrifying news and it’s worth asking what will prevent parliament from simply disrupting the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the newspaper said, calling the bill unconstitutional.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is the extended hand of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will hear us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs,” he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill actually handed over “complete control over the media” to the government, and the Standard newspaper that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “had a hard blow” and criticized the bill as “strict.”
The passing of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September Islamic shooter attack on the Westgate shopping center.
Kenyan media turned the anger of the authorities on themselves when they broadcast a security camera recording of soldiers sent to the attack site allegedly robbing a luxury goods store.
The police chief responded by summoning two journalists and a leading media worker for questioning, but the summoning was later withdrawn after pressuring the media.
According to the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million along with the risk of being “removed from the list” or being denied official journalist accreditation.
The court also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to destroy most radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidating effect on what is called Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do what they want without punishment.
“You never know what can happen,” wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting,” he wrote.
Kenya’s lawmakers have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts ordered by the national wage agency and to restore their gross salaries of around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, which is one of the highest in the world.
You have to fight, the young people know.
Most of them don’t even know what interest they have.
More and more people are putting their money aside.
However, they do not reach the championship in the region.
Austria is the country with the highest monthly savings, with an average of 181 euros per month.
In Slovakia there are more people than in the Czech Republic.
This is according to the survey of the Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving and two-thirds of respondents plan to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the savings ranking, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little savings products.
For example, almost every second Serbian, according to the survey, spends "under the pillow" at home.
This year, the number of people who pay higher monthly amounts has increased.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents spent between 1,000 and 2,5 thousand crowns each month on various types of savings, this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly deposit in the year-to-year comparison, however, slightly decreased to SEK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is retirement insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the other hand, the popularity of construction savings is declining, compared with last year, the interest in investment funds has also declined significantly.
Only 16% of respondents already use them, compared to almost a quarter last year.
The survey also revealed that while people find it important to save, most of them don’t know what revenue on individual products they are achieving.
In particular, young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is interested.
On the other hand, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their saved money, with 73 percent of people over 50 years of age knowing it.
In the international comparison of Erste Group, Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Austrians with a 12% gap.
United Nations Celebrates New Goals to Combat Poverty
The United Nations is immediately starting work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Prior to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at a summit last night that it was time to “rise above national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take over a process to implement the overall Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.
The SDGs will build on progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will do my utmost to fulfill the mandate given to me by the Member States and to fulfill our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns on Mozambique escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founder president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to shout out the slogans of peace at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Afraid of the future of her country, she exchanged her corporate clothes for a t-shirt decorated with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, daily reports came of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict will break out again in the country, but recent events have scared foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of vast coastal oil and coal reserves in the Northwest could bring more than $50 billion in investment from companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale in Brazil, Eni in Italy and Anadarko in the United States over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the government provoked the latest conflict by launching an attack on its members on September 17 in the Sofala province, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party.
The violent assault by former rebels culminated when government forces attacked a base of the Renamo party and attempted to kill Afonsa Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo party spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of launching conflicts because it is said to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to alleviate concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "disaster" who wanted to use "anything left of his power to try to prove that he can order the government to make his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns grew when Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the two sides did little to ease tensions between the two sides, sparked by a number of clashes this year.
It’s a carousel between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
None of them is a good negotiator, and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought election changes, has already said it would boycott the local elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the decaying movement to obtain benefits and financial gains from the government.
The Renamo party has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza – whose second term ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
“The democratic system does not want multiple parties, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace because it does not want to let go of the presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but it has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and the south.
Most of the clashes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira, the port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely for their coal exports, is located.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on whether Renamo would repeat its threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development, and the recent flood of abductions.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultuane says the people just want stability.
“Nobody is interested in Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” the author says.
Stories about Thor may show that “gross power cannot be equal to clever deceit,” while Arthur’s legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Much of the myths would be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene for school teaching,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates careful selection of works appropriate to age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk creation are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly teaching” authors and teachers are at the enthusiastic stories with a “sub-threshold” message for children as a “switch”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Tales, says: “You can have good intentions, but you do better if you keep them for yourself.”
Per the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or ended in a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly determined.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Brunei Star Wars will take visitors into space in a new digitarium
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the large planetarium has changed over the past six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can sit in new comfortable seats, and a 17-meter dome-shaped projection area from the American company Spitz has been added over their heads.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order for the picture to be perfect, additional smaller projectors are installed around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"There are twenty-one computers that generate the image," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brněn Astronomy.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a comprehensive impression.
“The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of traditional personal computers,” said Tomáš Hladík, a technician at Starbucks.
The digitarium can enchant an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the ocean floor.
Thus, the audience finds itself right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Other similar facilities are closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the starroom plans to project the purchased programs and its own creations in the hall.
There are two shows on Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about the training of cosmonauts, fly into space, go to the centrifuge, and then see the challenging conditions that astronauts face in space.
The second program is for children and has the title Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff, whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment when a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitarium cost about 50 million crowns, which was paid mostly by the Ministry of Education.
The City of Brunswick and the City of Brunswick also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The project area cost 10 million crowns, the projector 12 million.
“The rest was swallowed by audiovisual technology and computers,” Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the starhouse went through two years ago.
It is estimated that between 25,000 and 30,000 visitors will be there by the end of the year.
We reviewed 11,000 advertisements.
We know where they want you to work.
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 job ads, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 ads (62%) on the internet.
The Internet is now becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, it was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) it stood at around 60 percent.
The advertising of job opportunities in itself, according to the analysis, largely reflects the current situation in the labour market.
An example may be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in a period of economic prosperity and in a period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, 25,900 ads were posted in the same survey period, compared to less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented to a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
In contrast, the offer of jobs in the daily press covers a wider spectrum of professions, including those of workers, said the author of the analysis Pavlína Šťastnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies in both media.
On the Internet, advertisements looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken the leading places.
The position of programmers or leaders of small appeared only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representation belongs especially to the service and workers' professions.
Of course, one of the most frequently stated requirements that employers express through an advertising offer is education.
Other areas of study included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was mentioned in three percent of ads, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only 2% of the advertisements, employers required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims of “computer literacy” appeared in 40 percent of ads (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the internet in 57 percent).
Experience in the industry was requested in 54 percent of ads.
Practice requirements are associated with qualified professions.
This is especially true of manufacturing managers and other managers.
The workers’ professions include mechanics and repairers, or manufacturers and processors of food products, or repairers of electrical instruments, added study author Jiří Tillner.
Employers also indicate requirements on the qualities and skills of potential applicants in half of their ads.
As the most frequently sought-after skills in advertising, communication skills have long appeared in the first place.
Employers also demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City is the place where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a hundred years ago, varietary artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the gathered people jokes by the method of interview.
Fay’s innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and big theatres.
“Most of these titles appeared in the Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to play in the club,” Hirsch said.
We have created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes,” the annual musical comedy beneficial show at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival expanded, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comedians attending this year’s festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio and television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has grown up with his sitcom (the cheerfully spicy “League” on a fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, but was most famous for her fast-growing video series “Marcel the shell with shoes on”.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the careless, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest drawbacks of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes walks through the sidewalk between two buildings and says to himself, “Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I’ll live here.”
Oil prices dropped to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high reserves were offset by a report that showed the strengthening of China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil supply index for December during the late morning fell in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents and lagged by 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Wealthy oil reserves have burdened the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stocks increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production sparked a boost in demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent, the indicator for international oil used also by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
Not so, Mr Haas.
We have an opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to exercise such pressure that Martin Hašek is removed from all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will lower the level of political culture, which is already so tiny.
Martin Hašek is blessed with the promise he has made, but everyone and politicians in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the material, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics, people do not apologize, in politics they retreat.
Mr. Hašku, if you think well about this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in that, if you just lied - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, as a guy.
People will then accept your apology as the expression of a man who has made a mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a backless weak man, whose words or actions cannot be believed.
Either you want to be a proud, even a failing person, or a lifelong sketch.
It may seem unfair to you to speak only to you, but you are the leader and they are the wrong sheep.
And you are a leader and you have always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to fold your ears for a moment, re-group your forces, put off the shame and then attack again, but this is how the partisans or subversionists behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so behave like that.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The court blocked regulations regarding the procedure for arresting and searching persons by the NY police department
The Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday blocked a court order demanding changes to the program of arresting and searching persons at a New York police department and removed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Federal Court of Appeal said Judge Shiry Scheindlin’s decision would be postponed until the city’s decision on the appeal was filed.
The judge in August ruled that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The City challenged its findings and its amending regulations, including the decision to assign supervision to help the police department change its practices and its associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the requested deferral.
The Court of Appeal said the judge must be removed from the case because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, by not acting as a judge to avoid appearance of obscenity, in part due to a series of media interviews and a public statement by which she openly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongfully targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their program of arrest and search.
It established an independent oversight to oversee major changes, including the reform of procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test body cameras in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
An oral justification for the city’s appeal is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching persons have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, people have been stopped and searched for a number of decades, but recorded visits under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg rose dramatically to a record 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to a minority, filed a lawsuit that became a group lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the New York Police Department’s stop-and-seek program say the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and efficiency of the police force, and may affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that this will waste money, but will not solve a wider problem where the police force is under pressure after its numbers have decreased by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching persons, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NY police department introduced searches.
One-fifth of shopping centers suffer from low visits
This is according to data from real estate consulting companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Commercial Center will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are currently 90 major business centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are inadequately large center to the location and poor layouts, so too many floors or complicated and unclear arrangement of passages, or dead places of centers," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Retail Property Manager Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about one-fifth of shopping centers face low traffic.
Among the main reasons are, among other things, poor transportation availability, low income category of local residents or market saturation in a given place.
Some projects opened almost entirely, but their results were mostly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New business centers need to work harder to 'loving' their customers for new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," said Samadi.
The occupation of shopping centers is generally stable, even in some centers rising, because tenants were willing to reduce rent in the crisis and rent some units.
"But it is true that in recent years, some projects have been opened that are not fully occupied and reduce the average occupation (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Business centers opened in the past two years are promoting the market very slowly, according to Sylvie Samadi.
There is room on the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for building a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is definitely room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called ‘convinience centres’, aimed at purchases and daily services for the population living in the immediate vicinity,” said Samadi.
Also, according to Soták, there is room for other shopping centers in the domestic market.
Both for small service centers and large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansions in regional cities.
“Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth,” Soták said.
In Prague, they see a space for the prepared business center on the Victory Square, further, according to him, there is a clear potential for Na Příkopě and Václavské náměstí.
“The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, allowing merchants to cover and expand into smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, space is also available in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, respectively their reconstruction such as the reconstruction of Prior business houses, which benefit from a good location,” added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centers in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rental areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared with the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags behind about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson broke into the phone to check the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used the methods of “bumping into the phone, tracking and confronting” to confirm the fraudulent tip on a love relationship that was supposed to involve then-Interior Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis at Old Bailey court said News of the World in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glen Mulcaire to break into Pawlby's voice box and penetrate her privacy, but the court that Coulson was also calling her and leaving her voice messages.
“The prosecutor suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man standing in front of the house hoping to catch people out, but a man who likes to tell people stories to see what they say,” Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: rushing into the phone, watching, and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Evidently he knows about the other, watching, he has to know about it.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone?
He says no, we say, “But surely he knows.”
Rumors about the love relationship in which Clarke is involved were first captured by the NotW newspaper’s reporting department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, “You’re just wasting time, that’s with Charles.”
The recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator’s computer where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as “Projects.”
During the time Ms. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporting officer Neville Thurlbeck and former reporting officer James Weatherup oversaw Mrs. Pawlby’s movement.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice message saying, “I have received a story that we’re going to publish tomorrow and I’d love to talk about with Charles.”
Mr. Edis says Coulson’s involvement in the story was based on the same pattern as other prominent figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, it was that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett for a love relationship with a married woman, while he himself met with fellow accused Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied association with other persons in order to hack into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have confessed to hacking the phone.
NSA Disclosure Increases Social Paranoia of State Surveillance
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter whispered over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take a photograph of the roof of the U.S. advanced patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media that the BfV office hoped to be able to identify the presence of interceptor antennas, and this action sparked an exchange of views in Berlin between the US and German foreign ministers.
James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal business secrets from foreign companies in favor of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant from a collaborator, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen no longer know whether to believe the director’s words.
Following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, general paranoia about state surveillance has reached new dimensions.
The last drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone may have been intercepted for ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then the potential target are the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a poll released in July by the consulting service EY, German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the U.S. now poses as much risk as China.
However, in the entire documentation revealed by Mr. Snowden, so far, there is no evidence that the United States has transferred trade secrets from foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities, and said it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
The German parliament has voiced that we should make a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden is still shocking for some companies who had previously believed that China was the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have realized on a wider scale that data stored in the U.S. falls under its jurisdiction and is therefore potentially hackable.
According to a survey conducted by the business community Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members have canceled their plans to use a US-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, said: “We have a new question for customers that wasn’t here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction?”
Many high-ranking German officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets, and that data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It always happened.
“This has been a key topic for many years and hasn’t changed significantly even during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF’s agrochemical company.
Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our.
Business executives generally do not want to boast about the countermeasures they have taken in order not to give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been reminded that taking a free USB memory drive or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says that it has been a common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as interceptors.
The German agency BfV advises executives to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad because of the risk that smart phones can be fraudulent.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be discarded.
However, there is concern that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are at the forefront of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” BfV warns in its report.
The United States has warned its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, U.S. National Intelligence Estimate documents put France, alongside Russia and Israel, in the second row of perpetrators of hacking activities for economic news outlets in February, behind China.
A member of the board of the German Risk-Free Society concluded that in terms of economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in one of the interviews this month: “The services know very well that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a minor boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
Parents of a minor boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a cream-fighting spirits at his high school gym believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a straightened spirit behind the tribunes in the gymnasium he was attending.
Sheriff’s investigators from Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of the 17-year-old denies this.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff said.
“They believe it’s against logic, physical laws, and common sense,” Crump said.
They believe that this is to find out what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son’s death.
“As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I think there is sufficient basis for a regular investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of “locational suffocation.”
The second autopsy, however, indicated another cause of death.
“There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if in the case of Johnson’s death he discloses enough evidence for an order to investigate a crime or civil rights violation, he will request the FBI and its execution.
A representative of the sheriff’s office from Lowndes district was not immediately available on Thursday to comment.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all videos from surveillance cameras that investigators have viewed.
The child’s parents hope that the videos will contain a clue leading to the revelation of how their son died.
CDC Releases Guidelines for Schools on Children's Allergies
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies in school.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children’s food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline at their disposal – the most commonly used automatic EpiPen injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that appear in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, “It’s like someone is punching me in the tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “I feel like my tongue is swallowing.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “uncertain gender”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any gender for such children, and allows them to indicate gender as “uncertain” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pressuring parents to choose their child for surgery to determine gender, and to combat discrimination against intersex.
One intersex person said after many years, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain a sludge created by doctors, squeezed and scarred.
It is estimated that every year one in 2,000 babies is born who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual developmental disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, genital glands (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitals.
Intersex could be Wallis Simpson.
Determining gender is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it instead of waiting and monitoring the child’s psychological and physical development until the operation is performed, if any.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said the new German law “lookes like a good thing.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but for most children this is not the case,” he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery and then it can be waited as identity develops.
Knowing how a child’s sexuality develops is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question why this happens.
It’s like a mystery why some people are homosexual.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not bound by gender, but by their biological structure, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, chest and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys not matching any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to indicate male, female or “third gender” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “sexless” person in June, when she won a court appeal to keep her status of “uncertain” sex for the rest of her life.
In addition to M (man) and F (woman), German passports will also have a third designation, X, for intersex persons.
In neighbouring France, according to a report on France 24, the gender issue is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this highly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also criticized the German law, writing: “As the world is dragged to a new state where gender is a matter of choice, but not sexual activity, we are overturning two other pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the Baby zone that she would rather see the babies allocated a gender at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful without any further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children of both male and female sex were called hermafrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had a double sex.
And about a decade back, the medical community believed that sex is something like a board that can be deleted and repainted.
But now many question the ethical basis of surgery with the fact that gender belonging is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they don’t know how, given their gender, children will feel when they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex is submissive.
He created a new concept of “gender” and argued that social causes and environmental influences – how parents raised their child – influenced children’s genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as “John/Joan,” his theory became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to a poorly carried out circumcision to let their child be completely castrated, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he went back to the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38 he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared to be “unsatisfied with the outcome”.
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with male chromosomes but a vague genitalia.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he would never be able to live a “satisfactory life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s outer organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he was given female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18 he was sent to vaginal plastics.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After birth I was sterilized and nobody ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to develop its genitalia properly.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took doses of testosterone and had his bust removed,
The operation caused her infertility.
Today, he represents others in the organization called the Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “calls for cejching and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encouraging parents to make a quick decision and choose ‘undeterminate’ for the child,” she said.
We are afraid that this will encourage intervention.
We believe it is better to allocate male or female sex and then wait.
But we don’t know how the law will eventually sound, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to choose to be classified as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid gender,” she said.
German law is about to allocate it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not deceive at this time.
As they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist of the chest from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law “will give powers” to both parents and children.
Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes but has DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie has developed female traits.
He has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, 29-year-old Katie is married and works as a trainee in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or substitute motherhood.
“The law will give parents some space to not rush with their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and rethink it, and it gives them time before they write “man” or “woman”.
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy about it.
You don’t have to rush with an irreversible operation.
“It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
Eventually, the child decides which gender he identifies more with – and that’s a great thing.
It empowers children to make their own decisions.
A drunk man poured gasoline into his house and threatened to burn it with his family.
The tension increased, the fear escalated.
He threatened to burn the whole house.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the vicinity, as well as a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer firefighters.
A police negotiator also arrived at the scene, trying to explain his irrational behavior.
He threatened to burn the house.
A police force had to enter the house, which dismantled the man and caught him.
The attacker then ended up on examination in the Mladoboleslav Hospital, from where he was transferred to the anti-alcohol detection station.
The firefighters then filled the house with gasoline, which they later cleaned up.
In addition, all the animals were rescued.
The police officer did not contact the man, so the commando followed him.
Obama's campaign was considering replacing Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton on the 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times magazine obtained a copy of the coming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president's top co-workers were holding intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes for re-election.
According to the national-political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House chief of office Bill Daley, to measure what effect the move of former Secretary of State Clinton to vice president would have on the election.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago Campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Hall.
Only a few of the president’s closest advisors — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew that this change was being considered.
The book “Double down” claims that Daley was the leader of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they eventually decided not to take the move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would “not significantly increase Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I’ve been researching a lot of things intensively, and this was one of them,” he told Daley.
You must not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we were saying, “Kristepane, what should we do?”
While Daley characterized the research as “appropriate care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had made considerable investments to see if this move would pay off in the election.
“With campaigns, we don’t spend that much money on elections and qualitative research unless something is really seriously considered,” Martin told AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama was aware that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about this potential card blending.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of the potential changes, the former chief of office admitted that it was “likely” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe has reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know about the research about removing Biden from the candidate.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using a medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous mole.
He came to the idea when he read a paper on a medusa, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes luminousness.
This ice cream reacts with the tongue of the consumer – it increases the pH level of the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, so the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I’m delicious,” says: “It’s an amazing substance, but when it comes to manufacturing, we’re at the beginning, so for £200 you get about 2 grams of this substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream begins to shine.
We’ve tested it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because light-colored meduses are four times more expensive than gold.
Each piece costs about £140.
It tastes great.
Charlie’s experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold.
The next product is even more ambitious.
He says, “I would really like to make an invisible ice cream.”
In essence, this is impossible because of the braking of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I count on finding a way to do that.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the medusa, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay awake for a long time and show up to our neighbors in a dress.
Today I feel like I’ve become a puppy.
For two years, no candy has appeared in my apartment, and this year it will probably not be different.
However, statistics show that when it comes to Halloween, I am a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans will celebrate Halloween this year – in fact, 158 million of them – and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
Every time I look forward to Halloween, it’s trending.
The NRF estimates that of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion will go to costumes.
This year’s latest fashion shoot is sexy non-living objects.
Sexy no longer just women; sexy can also be foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies thanks to the Dead Parade, and I bet that the space men from Daft Punk will pull it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with following the tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pets.
So you will see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
This is approximately 300 million kg of Hershey tables, slices, Milk Duds and Twizzlers sweets, and Clark bars.
This is amazing news for the 41 million cowboys who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to attack our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe not, we eat, 45 million kilograms of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want are corn candies, and yet, according to the National Cake Association around Halloween, 16,000 tons of them are sold.
That’s about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That’s a secret I’ve never solved.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best titles, such as “Terror behind the walls,” “Howl-O-Scream,” and “The House of Shock.”
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated horror houses in the United States that, according to the American Horror Houses, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes the amazing photos you’re scared of and that your friend put on Facebook, and you can’t remove them, and the person you like will look at the photo and write a comment as “you look nice.”
Finally, a little bit about the strawberries.
When we were young, Charlie Brown introduced us to a big pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since childhood.
Fortunately for us, the “child-in-chicken” trend started thanks to the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up cutting a stick instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkin.
A pumpkin candlestick with a stirring flame on your front veranda is probably from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkin have grown this year.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California and try to cut off their one tonne-weight pumpkin.
Land Rover Racing Series Announcement

Schwarzenberg: Early elections in two years
Top 09 Chairman Karel Schwarzenberg is expected to hold early elections.
A week after the last one in an interview with Aktuálně.cz he said that there is no other way out and every government that came out of voting last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blunder.
“It can’t last long,” said Karel Schwarzenberg, estimating the life span of the upcoming parliamentary term in two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose entirely differently next time, he disagrees: “I think it will be a bit more balanced decision making.”
At the same time, the Chairman of the TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as this year (compared to 2010 it lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that early elections will be held, it will strengthen the 2011 ANO movement of Andrei Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where the chairman Bohuslav Sobotka after a covert lán meeting of part of the leadership of the party declared that he or Michal Hašek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, commented Schwarzenberg after his:
“The leading officials of the Democratic Party as little boys follow the head of state to allow them a coup in the party.”
“I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and smarter.”
"Because I have never seen anything so unexpectedly stupidly done in my life," added the chairman of TOP 09.
And in the direction of President Zeman (with whom he encountered in the fight for the presidency) he drowned: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to seize that party."
The top 09 has already been announced.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Farsky contract register, which was discussed by parliamentary committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
The Chairman of TOP 09 in an interview with Aktuálně.cz says that such speed is given by the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, the TOP 09 is obviously trying to prevail similar attempts from other sides.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of having the idea of introducing a register of contracts "robbed" the program of the ANO movement.
Top 09 has now taken advantage of the advance – just dusted the proposal, which had already entered the second reading of the House.
Firefighters came to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a stone collapse
Ruby escaped after a car accident.
Three days later, he was caught in a pedestal and was spotted by a man who wrapped a dog.
Firefighters slanted on a rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The puppy was rescued by firefighters who arrived to rescue him after somehow being stuck on a dangerous outburst in a stone crash 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived three days on his own until he was released from a stone collapse on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20), were in the Flappit stone crash in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they fired after their lost dog and posted calls on social networks.
On Wednesday at about 14:15 a.m., a clever-looking puppy man saw Ruby stuck on a pinpoint in a stone crash 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and slammed down to free Ruby, using a transport bag for animals to pick him up on the rock.
Technical rescue team chief Andy Clayton said: “The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock wall – 15 meters from the top and below.
He didn’t move his eyebrows – he was completely frozen.
Now he is okay.
He got cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
To see the dog is incredible.
Technical rescue team chief Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “When I saw the rescue operation, I was scared.”
I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It was great to hold him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably have fallen.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We are so grateful, they were all awesome.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: “We feared he might fall, but he stayed there.”
Firefighters were great.
We still don’t understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims he hasn’t gone after 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview for an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang accompanying vocals for Jagger’s 2004 song “Old Habits Die Hard.”
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went out for her.
She added, “It’s been a long time ago and now he’s very kind to me.”
In a statement on Thursday, Jagger’s (70) representative said he categorically rejected ever making Katy Perry suggestions.
The agent said, “Maybe you’re confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album “Prism” debuted on the first place this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for an independent Scotland’s membership in the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to the stories of passport checks in Berwick and the barbed wire along Hadrian’s valley.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this did not appear in the headlines.
No one has mentioned that EU member states are spending a lot of time adjusting their official laws where appropriate.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, an offer of continuing non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for anything they really want from the Scots.
This is a very weak story.
The journalist duck that “independence means passport control” I heard at least 40 years ago.
However, there is an interesting idea hidden in this story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why exchange the London chomout for the Brussels, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
As a result of the crisis of the euro, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Thro Europe, parties dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came as if from nowhere and already won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially “wiping out” the Liberal Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
At home there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis has become a crucial moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, coupled with the scourge of the national economies by clinging to the common currency, have led many to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are dealing with a high budget deficit – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it’s a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters – and that’s what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, Southern Europe has a disadvantage over Germany in terms of domestic production.
The only way to help is to cut revenue and public spending, which Germany is encouraging.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper cause for European poor performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code for supporting French and German at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline than it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even a global salary freeze would not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being stifled by cheap shale oil from the United States.
The result is a stirring rebellion, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that would keep Germany on the brink and allow Paris to stand in the world at the level of Washington.
Berlin, however, no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy and has pushed its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning to British Labourists that they can’t assume that the split of the right will automatically be positive to the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament working against the common currency.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
It seems to me that in the foreseeable future the growing anti-European sentiment and attitude against the common currency will unite and the euro will perish.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transform itself into something more free in the sense of a “Europe of (sovereign) nations” preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where is Scotland?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of telling Berlin and Brussels when to let us go.
I assume that Scotland would do well in a relaxed arrangement of Europe if itined its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – strangely – the most successful austerity-free political movement in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition to the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland voted for independence now just to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early puberty
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanics reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is approaching.
There is no evidence that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it.
Experts argue that one of the triggers of early puberty can be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of early puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened when her daughter begins to grow breasts and hair in shame at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I’ve spent a lot of time assuring my parents that it’s usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair loss on the scarf and underarms, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age when the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years from 12.75 years in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, it will take at least two to three years for the first menstruation to occur,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to coping with this common problem.”
The most reliable test of how puberty will proceed is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, a girl is considered to be “precocious.”
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be carefully monitored by pediatricians.
A faster growth can be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or a cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature ageing of bones, which can eventually lead to stopping growth and shrinkage in adulthood.
Recommendations regarding medication and hormonal therapy are dependent on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
When it comes to using drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that “suppression of puberty can alleviate problems with a girl’s behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried she might get pregnant or how she’ll handle hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter started having menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn’t prepared emotionally.
She came home from school frightened and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no consistent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious cause is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 who associated body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
Explanations are different.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions through climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys appear to have hair in the face and shame at a young age, the trend towards the full blossom of early puberty is not as evident as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) added additional complexities to this topic.
Acne and hair shaming is common even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean you need to talk to your child sooner than you would expect,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your baby will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need assurance that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadia Konvalinková in the role of a housekeeper.
Has a new job?
The actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the screw in the role of a pub and she was very successful.
That the favorite Czech actress planned a change of profession and went on business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalink appeared at the James Joyce Irish pub and turned a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I got it right away.
Even the boss offered me to hire me and I could feed myself by turning beer.
But I refused, I’d rather stay with what I’m doing today, with acting,” Konvalinkova, who was a guest at the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub, said with a smile.
“I love Irish beer and I’ll drink Irish whiskey here,” she said.
At the event also appeared Nadi's long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nový.
I am after death and in this new life I must not drink.
I’m allowed to drink one beer or one drink a day, and I try to observe that,” the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers are fighting for seat width, big contracts are at stake
A dispute over the width of second-class seats for long-haul flights has erupted among leading aircraft manufacturers, causing a bitter exchange of views at the Dubai air show this month.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that airlines would typically precede, but whose allocated space is key to the efficiency claims for the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus has called for industry standards this week to offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economy class, but the main U.S. rival Boeing says it is up to airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way the rear part of the aircraft is arranged – especially whether it has 9 or 10 seats side by side – is the basis for the economic performance claims on the designs of the new “mini-jumbo” aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded “777X” will carry 406 people in economy seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46 cm wide economy seats spread over 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through ads in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain predominance with more than 100 orders.
He recently predicted what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture depicting three people stuck in a restaurant titled “Would you like it?”
“Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people are getting bigger, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air transport, by the turn of the century, according to the U.S. Department of Health data, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 has increased by 10 percent.
According to American medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century has 100 cm in his waist.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the 1950s seat concept, when the average seat width of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that suggests that extending the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus’ seat dimensions and says it’s not in the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines pay fees and equipment.
The company also says the research shows that the cabin experience depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do the things they believe they need to do in order to be successful,” said Kent Craver, a cabin space expert.
They don’t want us to dictate what brings them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, greater elbow space is critical, but for suppliers, this is a growing problem that can affect returns.
Behind this dispute is a race in aircraft orders with an estimated trade worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices over the coming decades, enough to shift the weight of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters in July, the seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to have achieved 20 percent better efficiency in their latest two-engine long-haul aircraft designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing’s performance demands depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to move more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that 10-seater cabins in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a thicker layout that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
“A forty-five inches wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view of Airbus, the proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Scented aircraft dealers even carry a measurement band with them to check the competitive arrangement.
While hunting for convenience, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft arrangements for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin adjustments by offering wider seats in the hallways for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single additional manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unheard, but may discourage the wave of 777X sales.
The number of people infected with HIV has exceeded 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people is growing every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 216 people were infected, a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavatý, an expert on AIDS, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him last year from January to September, 165 patients with HIV increased in the country, this year for the same period there were 176.
From the start of the follow-up until the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
The number reached 1005 in September.
In the district, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravia region, 130 from Moravskoslezsky and 116 from Ústecký.
The lowest number of infected persons came from the province, with 19 of them.
In total, 88 percent of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected in the past by blood transfusions.
Such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were born with the HIV virus, which was passed on to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the film Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
Fantastic film from the universe Gravity some time after the premiere sold out in the Czech cinemas.
According to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers in October and earned more than 26 million kronor.
Most reviews evaluate the picture positively.
However, there are some irregularities in it.
The server asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Hvězdárny a planetária Brno): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The film Gravity does not exceptionally, although it looks like a "physically real" show.
Not, but that doesn’t mean he’s bad.
I him very much.
You can see Sandry Bullock’s hair, which does not fly in the state of weightlessness.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station are moving along significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one image.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of the fire in the state of weightlessness.
They also said that they would not be able to withstand such injuries.
The heroes in the film Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and costumes without much trouble will withstand everything.
Criticism was not spared.
Such an extensive tragedy on Earth's orbit is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
In addition, he wondered why the doctor was sent into space to correct the technique.
People also argue about the “irreal” behavior of lan on the forums.
It seems like a bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Hvězdárny a planetária hl. m. Prahy): I have only seen him on a wide canvas so far, but I can say clearly, I was fascinated.
It was not a documentary, but a science fiction film.
And with such a story, the author has the right (almost the duty) not to stick to reality consistently.
“More than the irregularities you mentioned, I was touched by how the space station is shown three times with a degrading level of technology (last time Chinese).”
"The Chinese, after all, will not be until the end of the decade and it will probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in trying not to violate the laws of physics, and so the natural science-oriented viewer will appreciate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions the moment of moment is quite correctly preserved, in the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the polar glow blinking on the polar regions.
Inequalities will be found in a more detailed examination.
Additionally, for example, when I read the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic garbage in orbit appears to be reversed in some scenes than it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and heavenly calling offenses against logic or natural laws I did not see in the film and compared to other movies of similar focus is to be seen that the creators made it matter on the credibility of the events shown.
Among the moments that don’t make sense, it’s worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits on an otherwise inclined orbit than the ISS.
The result is a significant difference in speed and the rescue operation could not actually take place as shown in the film.
Furthermore, in the moment of the separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) I did not notice that the entire ISS would rotate, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to start at the moment when they no longer move towards each other.
New nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect a mouse from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Additional tests will take several years before testing on humans, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says the first signs are good.
“We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong to overcome all current approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been assembled to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies pursue all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thereby preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine impact.
During the tests, vaccinated mice who were supplemented with nicotine continued their normal activities.
But mice that were not vaccinated “calmed down,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine has entered their brains.
The study is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be administered so often as to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower, as they turn liver cells into factories to produce antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they get to smoke and avoid nicotine addiction.
However, smokers are much more likely to use it to quit.
“They’ll know that when they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they won’t have any benefit from it, and that will help them get rid of this bad habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but point out that more research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee on Corruption Surveillance.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the coastal rental policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its investigation to whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to renew his rental at Circular Quay, where Mr. Obeid owned two restaurants and a café, without having to participate in a tender after its expiry in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid’s covert interests in these properties, based on evidence submitted on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi’s former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks started in 2005, the government pushed for rents to go to public tenders.
The contractors were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, rents for at Circular Quay, which brought Obeid’s $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a tender.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at Mr. Obeid’s request, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in the government’s rental policy.
The record of the calls submitted to the ICAC showed the calls between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodim from August to September 2007 and Mr. Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port department after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
“Was the topic of the talks during these phone calls the development of the commercial rental policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr Tripodi.
I can’t remember what we talked about, but not about this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft have attacked a target in Syria, said the official
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Lázikíja on Thursday night, a responsible official of the administration confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on missile supplies in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it is different.
For example, commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that he could agree with this, while the chairman Štěch stirred up disagreements.
Hejtman Chovanec was suspected of me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and remains, a symbol of that poverty of the ČSSD.
Most of them showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and useless, Vice-President Zaorálek has made most of the interview on television impossible.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than for the ČSSD to propose the deputy chairman of the Senate Gajdůškovou as prime minister, the only one would not have an initial handicap and I think it would perform standard performance.
This is such a good decision that hardly anyone in the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could, without fear, set up a minority government with merely a blessing from President Babiš and without the people, but with the people’s health minister Hovorká, who is actually a believing Social Democrat.
This minimum government would have great stability, because it would promote the ordinary law on the referendum and the President of Úsvitu Okamura has pledged to support it.
President Babiš would eventually reconcile himself with the progress of taxes, because he is clever and will see that it cannot be done without it.
The people would not bring problems, because Hovorka is the carrier of the best they have, and otherwise they would not be in the government.
The same applies to YES, even here a valuable minister would be found, but when they reasonably do not want to enter a risky government participation, but they will provide support, too.
Give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
Foreign workers with visa authorization may undergo a “qualification” test
As the government intends to extend police interventions, it is considering a “qualification” test for foreign workers with visa authorization 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as a backdoor for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was released today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australian neighbors.
“The loud statements of ‘foreigners at the end of the line’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remnant of a time when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that white workforce should be protected – and I’t be surprised if anyone in this region noticed the echo of this historic artifact.
The discussion article outlines 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to negotiate with officials over human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants can be thoroughly examined whether “the nomination is eligible for situations where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring company.”
Based on previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, companies may also be required to justify the number of 457 visa holders.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat to the Christmas Islands this week.
The man’s frightened nine-year-old son travelled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed the man to the hospital on the Christmas Islands, where he died.
The British government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would “connect Britain together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “enthusiastic” about working with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After completion of Phase Two, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government re-evaluated the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which has been in talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 to examine additional railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London equivalent to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.”
We put the SH2 green because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
HS2 will also help connect 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “unambiguously” support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed railway has the potential to bring Scotland immense economic benefits, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of the high-speed railway across the UK.”
So we are excited to work with the British government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland to benefit all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the UK ministers during the next year and to jointly decide on further steps.
Barth arrested by police and anti-corruption analyst
Information about the arrest of Víta Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the message was brought by the server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS), its people were to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
It was at the Four Seasons Hotel.
The Inspectorate deals with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its competence also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, among the arrested is one of the anti-corruption police officers - the chief analyst and informaticians Jan Petržílek.
He previously worked for the Information Security Service.
But the anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej declined to comment on the information, adding that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
Her inspection spokeswoman, Radka Sandor, did not want to say anything about the case, referring to the City Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," spokeswoman Štěpánka Zenklová said.
Also from this unconcrete reaction, it can be inferred that the event took place, but is in a secrecy mode, which does not allow speakers to say anything specific.
In a similar situation is Bart’s lawyer Oldřich Chudoba.
He told the media that he represents Bárta "even in this matter", but given that it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bárt's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart’s arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted to the office by Barta together with former VV chairman Radek John, who was at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute between former Prime Minister Peter Nečas and VV had even to be solved by then-President Václav Klaus.
I don’t know where this connection came from to my person.
No one contacted me, I was not questioned.
“I really don’t know anything about it,” Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Officially, he was promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party but was then Barta.
Bárta now candidated in the elections for the Dawn movement, the parliamentary mandate escaped him only tightly - with 175 votes.
Lider Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what it was about.
"Vít Bárta was one of many candidates of many parties on our candidate and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of direct democracy Tomio Okamura," he distanced himself from Bárta Okamura, who before the elections said that he gave Bart the space to run for Dawn, because he helped him solve the problem of executives.
Vít Bárta appeared in court in 2012 with his former VV counterpart Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules for using electronic devices on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for now
Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite changes in the U.S. in order to mitigate regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. airlines the space to change their practices so passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of the flight, as long as the equipment remains in “flying” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are bothered by not having access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a lot of work from U.S. carriers to meet the requirements, but have suggested that they do not plan to change their practices soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it has examined the notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft,” he said.
This issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety isined at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken with CASA about expanding the use of its on-board wi-fi entertainment system, was inclined to the change, but announced that it would submit to the decision of the regulatory authority.
“We would welcome if CASA conducted an analysis of permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless onboard entertainment) would improve customer experiences,” the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices are not allowed to be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this in the near future," he said.
The FAA regulations apply to American airlines.
But we are constantly interested in regulatory developments that can be useful to our passengers, and we will definitely study the FAA decision and the reasons behind it thoroughly.
For U.S. air carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“Once the airline confirms its fleet’s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will order passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in the storage space above the head during takeoff and descent.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, Singapore’s stallions are flourishing
At a shopping mall in Bendemeer, Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter’s tuition fee.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I spent all my money on it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 ($3,000 SGD) a month as an administrator and her husband is also working, the family’s monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across regions in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is indeed such that ValueMax, where a woman carries out her transaction, became the third standout on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1,300 SGD in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it’s also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Stop-offs in Singapore typically apply an annual 17 percent rate, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, stopping stations have the advantage that they do not require a person’s verification (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And so as families feel pressured by rising cost of living and increasing household debt and consumer debt, millions across the region turn to shelters.
After five years of tremendous growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by eased monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to shelters to cope with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor’s cited the increasing use of household loans, mainly due to rising rents, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a weakening consumer demand.
“The main thing is that with rising costs, people from middle to low [income scale] will try to replenish their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to people temporarily stopping their personal assets and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
Approximately 70 percent of the items stalled in 200 city stalls are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop my grandmother’s golden necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand’s largest store operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20-percent increase in the number of customers using its store in recent months.
Growth in the building industry is so great that ValueMax, operating a branch in the heart of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also beyond Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGDs it raised on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have found themselves under fire of criticism for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says the collateral not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn’t directly increase debt.
“Customers are stopping items they already own, and monetizing personal property does not increase household debt,” he says.
In society, asset deposit is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
In addition, among those who use stallions, it is not only people in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, and can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all possible backgrounds.
“These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term because of their bold deals or investments, or small who need help solve problems in their cash flow,” Yeah says.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian healthcare
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s debilitating healthcare should include harsh conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said the Australian Union was taking “accelerated measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the island’s aging population, increased chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The four-year funding was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilk.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the country,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for surgeries at a patient’s request.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic surgeries and cataracts, will help eliminate debt.
The money is also for open-access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved postoperative care, training of health specialists, mental health services, and the introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the ideas that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian healthcare system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict system of reporting and registration obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Australian Union, and report monthly on where the additional funding has been spent.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be useless “until there is a genuine reform to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised during talks with the prime minister in early May.
“I believe the federal aid package can get the state’s public health services out of a critical state,” Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal opposition spokesman for healthcare Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is just a “patch.”
“The reason I’m here is because the Labour government has removed $430 million from our healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a state government that takes away almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union that gives 300 million dollars, and pretend it’s good news.
Mr. Dutton urged Ms. Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar from the bailout package will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted the novel by Denis Didrot, which brings an exceptional filming and portrayal of the time, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in the 18th century in France, the film tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When he revolts, he experiences extreme cruelty from a punishably perverse mother introduced and becomes the object of sexual passion for another.
The film never slides to chilliness or sensationalism, and that’s his problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that the spectators will also experience the torments similar to wearing a t-shirt.

Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons facilities, says supervisory authority
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons manufacturing equipment and ammunition with poisonous gas, the Global Chemical Weapons Surveillance Committee said on Thursday, as fierce conflicts erupted in the north of the country, near one of the places where poisonous substances are presumed to be deposited.
On Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began three years ago.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) announced a day before November 1.
the deadline set by the Hague-based organization to Damascus for the destruction or rendering impossible the operation of all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the purpose of the production of toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons including yperite and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came as fighting erupted in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons factory and storage facilities, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
There are 29,954 members of Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead are 2,202 government fighters and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s forces have fought in Saffira against insurgents, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that losses were on both sides, but had no concrete numbers.
The fighting has highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who have to deal with tight deadlines for their mission to remove the chemical arsenal in Syria amid the ongoing civil war.
In a statement from the OPCW office, which works closely with the UN, it was said that its team is now “happy to have verified – and monitored the destruction – of Syria’s declared critical equipment for production and mixing/fill.”
He added that “there are no further control activities currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 locations declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two places due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “abandoned and ... items of the chemical weapons program it contained had been moved to two other declared sites that had been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Saffira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed on a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
“I worship the courage and courage you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission this organization has ever had,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, the director of observers, in a statement released by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year of civil war, the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, the foothold of Shiite Islam, are facing each other.
As for further developments, the head of the Ramí Abdul Rahman Observatory said Wednesday there was a powerful explosion inside an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lázikíja.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Condemnation of the perpetrator of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing attack reacted furiously to the verdict given to the last of the founders who had been brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent 10 years escaping as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for assembling explosive devices that were used in the bombing attack.
He could be released in 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of a mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, leaving 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombing attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded life imprisonment, although it could insist that a man called “Demolition man” be sentenced to death because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders almost a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of others.
For the AAP, Ms. Corteen said: “He should be put in front of the executions.”
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see my other grandchildren and daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the ground when, on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 a.m., a powerful load placed outside a parked truck was detonated.
Peter Hughes was in the Paddy bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion he fell for a month into a coma, and whileined alive, three times the doctors “dead”.
Mr. Hughes said Pateka would face the same fate as three other members of the terrorist cell of Jamah Islam responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
To keep him alive... there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others is not that much.
Patek was the last suspect of the Bali attack.
He escaped arrest for a decade, but was eventually caught in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up voluntarily,” Ms. Corteen said.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for the sorrow he caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will take place later this year and which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“We’ll see a lot of tears this year,” Ms. Corteen said.
Patek can appeal the verdict.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use technological advances on planes (but they can’t call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “door-to-door” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music under the eagerly awaited new rules released by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers, however, do not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary by airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA to what extent their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated board crew training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They cannot turn them on until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain gives permission.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft drops to land, and not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and driving, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new rules are safely implemented – and we will work closely with transport companies on this – it will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
To be honest, we are tired of looking like “guards.”
However, surfing the internet, sending emails and text messages or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be advised to switch their smartphones, tablets, and other devices to flight mode.
So still no Words with Friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, thrown out of an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops will still have to be stored because of fears they could injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Mobile phones are prohibited on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Committee on Telecommunications.
The FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transportation Safety, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones continued to be seen as a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from FCC data we also know that in the air they can cause interference to the transmission towers,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA administration to examine the issue last month suggested that the government allow for wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, say there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to one-third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radios, a technical advancement of the time.
The new airlines are far more reliant on electric systems than the aircraft of previous generations, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at sea altitudes.
Plans adjusted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adjust to more electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less radio intensity than the devices of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimal broadcasts when turning a page.
But broadcasting is more powerful when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing to release restrictions on the use of these devices by travellers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded a transport aircraft with their Kindle electronic readers and performed a test flight, but no problems appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he is convinced that interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference to aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the equipment while flying according to instruments in low visibility.
The Tourism Industry Group welcomed these changes and said it was a reasonable approach for the traveling public, which uses technology in abundance.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airborne from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into the wild.
The bird was transported to the coast after being found exhausted on a oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One shrimp was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after previously treated by the Scottish company SPCA in a rescue center until he recovered.
Operating Center Colin Seddon said: “This shrimp probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea.”
He appeared to have lost his strength and found refuge in the oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help.”
When he was released, he was in good shape and healthy.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what changes UK entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
For this purpose, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked leading UK businessmen about their views about Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK companies of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the overwhelming majority of companies are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than get stuck in a long and burdensome process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the cost of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European business area – even 40 percent of large companies, traditionally most pro-European companies, agreed.
And finally, our survey of leading companies revealed the most outstanding insight, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek a change in the treaty and relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, identified by companies of various sizes and major business groups, suggest that the business sector is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will transfer its influence back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better deal for Britain could mean a profit of up to 16 percent when voting in a referendum for staying in the EU.
The prime minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to signify a significant shift from the current balance of forces back to Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves toward a tighter economic and fiscal union.
Employment and growth in the UK must be a priority, and as our survey shows, for business this means a re-focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels’ regulatory approach.
John Kerry Admits Spying Has Goed Too Far
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in spying, Secretary of State John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the ministry, the information was collected to prevent terrorist attacks.
“The first confession from Washington,” according to AFP, came amid a sharp controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about the mass surveillance of data by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), targeted by U.S. allies.
“In some cases, I admit, just like the president (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure you that this will not happen in the future,” Kerry said.
In the interview, he mainly advocated the practice.
According to him, the information gathering is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent attacks such as the attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005.
“We prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to be informed on time about the coverage,” Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went excessively far".
The affair around the U.S. intelligence agency, which allegedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would ban or significantly limit surveillance.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says pipeline in Bulgaria is opening a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
“Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which bring most of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” eliminated.
Once the entire project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is expected to begin in other countries in the direction of flow by the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits.
Lebanese Hezbollah has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to continuously clarifying reports, Israel destroyed missiles aimed at Hezbollah during Wednesday’s strikes on two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite group is fighting in Syria on the side of the army.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which has not interfered in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah’s hands in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday’s Israeli airstrikes on arms warehouses in western Syria are only being clarified.
Israel has not commented on the attack, but it has been confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean area hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Džabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabia that two warehouses where the missiles were prepared to be transported to Lebanon were hit.
The missile was a Russian-made SA-8 missile.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian air force is teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah how to handle missiles.
The SA-8 is an outdated missile that the Syrian army has owned since the 1980s.
They are placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to their mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with a radar, but it turns off when the missile is fired, making it difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has participated in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
It claims to help protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alawites belong.
Nowly 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help the army take back Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalamun is located between Damascus and Homs, the third largest city in the country.
The battle is to be a retaliation for the recent opposition attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Brigade of Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah has helped the Syrian army regain the city of Kusajr near the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the Kusajir rebels fled to Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
The reasons were corruption, wasting money for overpriced purchases and government procurement, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the results of the election, the majority of citizens were satisfied with this situation.
That they did not really bother and with the state that was here (the robbery and debt of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not attend the election, 596 357 voters voted for TOP 09 384,174 voters voted for ODS in total, so 4,394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all legitimate voters.
That is a majority.
When I count 1 016 829 voters to the aforementioned parties of the ČSSD, then with the old order (because all said parties participated in the "robbing" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed to this status.
By doing so, the majority of voters have shown that they are not for the punishment of the culprits of the stealing and over-debting of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the CPSD who participated in this will stand up for the proper laws?
Is it helping us at all?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) have been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned that before charges were brought against children's educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with child sexual abuse.
But before the commission, it was that in its initial statement to the commission, the association stated that it had never addressed a child sexual abuse case in its organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned on the case where one of the YMCA employees was accused of child pornography offenses, and on another, when a gymnast in Caringbah from the YMCA was convicted in 1991 for sexual harassment of children he cared for.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the commission’s adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s initial statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in the YMCA, which recognized the organization as a leading advocate for children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the commission suggests that the YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in the August audit of the Ministry of Education and Society.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him alone downward failed when he accepted Mr. Lord, without making sure the staff were aware of the obligation to report breaches of children’s safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the allegation that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting children’s safety violations by Mr. Lord.
Members of the staff provided evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including Lord being alone with the children, guarding them privately, letting them sit on their knees, telling them that he loves them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord’s subordinate and asked for children’s safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of children’s services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord’s superior, was “very intimidating and often difficult to talk to him about anything.”
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt unconscious if they had to contact their superiors and report the acts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord darkened their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that he told the YMCA Board in New South Wales that the lesson from the “Jonathan Lord case” for the organization was that the staff “did not report” and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to let staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations appeared was made by YMCA’s General Manager for Children’s Services, Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid distortion of evidence, but was “excessively diligent” and poorly carried out.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that would be safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in the recruitment, inspection, recruitment, training and management of personnel.
The hearing was postponed for December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return is unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since he resigned in June 2007, after ten years in leadership, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talking about British politics and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an ambassador to the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the post of prime minister, the London newspaper Evening Standard replied, “Yes, of course, but it’s hard to do that, so...”
While crowds of horse-show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he wasn’t going to school yet and only took his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly rolled out three rounds to eventually win the main prize and leave behind 30 dragging adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank Riding Centre in the Rudry village near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, slid his baret to a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control horses, which far exceeded his age.
And Toffee got the highest scores for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given in March for his third birthday and has been exercising with this Shetland poni everyday since then.
His mother, Donna (30), said: “Fenton and Toffee work great together.”
They did not make great hopes, but eventually left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone encouraged and applauded.”
He ran on the sand all along the length of the arena and although he acted so slightly, he performed great.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and the farm, and he has taken care of two chickens.
Given how he started, he will soon be in the Horse of the Year competition again and I’m sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said: “Fenton’s only three, but he already knows how to control a pony.”
Together they make a great team.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their outstanding speech and for the way they showed up in the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork is between the pony and the leader – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I’m sure Fenton’s lovely clothes also helped, really fit there with him.
Too curious newspapers to be investigated
Chinese newspapers, which on the front page requested the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he used bribery to invent stories about a state-owned company.
The administrator said New Express would now carry out a “complete correction.”
The order for the “correction” came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in the province of Kuang-tung.
The preliminary investigation revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper from the Evening News group in Yangtze issued several false reports about Zoomlion.
“The editorial board of the New Express newspaper was disorderly,” the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revoking his journalist license.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out the overall correction of the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in the New Express and immediately change the leadership of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express about financial irregularities in a building equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper issued two requests on the front page for his release, claiming to stand behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had issued false stories for a reward.
“In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion as well as to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I longed for money and fame.
I realize I acted wrong.
Following Mr. Chen’s apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page stating that he failed to conduct an adequate check of his messages.
Several suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of this year’s law amendment that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
U.S.-Mexico drug smuggling tunnel with railway found
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been discovered, with its own lighting, ventilation and an electric railway.
U.S. authorities have described the tunnel, about one meter long, as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clings into the length of six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is filled with indefinite warehouses, so that trucks can be easily hidden before being loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be carried unnoticed in it.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In case of conviction, they face sentences of imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate vast drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a problem for drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a 650-meter-long corridor equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economy and management are linked.
For example, a joint advertisement.
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken the next step in transforming the Center holding into its media home.
Since Friday, the company has a joint top management team.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the staff union are essential for the integration of both publishers into a common media house," commented the changes, Deputy Chairman of the Economy Board and Chief Executive Officer Kamil Čermák.
Chermák, who will be at the head of the unified management, will be supplemented by the CEO of Centrum Holdings Andreas Demuth.
The new joint director of the store was appointed Pavel Vopařil, to whom the advertising director of both companies Zuzana Tylčerová is subordinate.
The new Head of Information Technology was appointed.
The joint director of the editions is Vladimír Piskáček, in whose team is also the director for transformation Jakub Unger.
Adela Pitts was appointed Director of Marketing.
The separate department of corporate communication is now headed by Věra Lhotská.
Joint financial director is Karel Žalud, managing human resources for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
“The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the creation of content of all issued titles and, last but not least, to further significantly streamline the company’s business management,” added Čermák.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, signed a contract to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of the servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or a portfolio of more than two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Economic newspapers, the IHNED.cz news server, the Respekt and Economic weekly and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among the Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This year in June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Prague’s Karline.
CME focuses on television business.
Nearly a quarter of the people are released.
Media group CME will be fired.
By the end of the year, we want to reduce the number of people by 1,000.
Osekat intends all side activities and focuses only on its main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs approximately 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of the people work.
Media Group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CET 21 holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs approximately 650 people, and what it will mean for the domestic television unit TV Nova, is not yet clear.
“This is premature and we can’t really comment on it,” said Novy Communications Director Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, a significant dismissal in the Czech Republic will not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should be on the staff of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new CEOs Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who succeeded longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that they wanted to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of producing its own programs, filmmaking and production activities.
In Prague, a cooling tower burned.
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, a large capacity storage facility, according to firefighters, probably a cooling tower, burned.
"Firefighters were coming to the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, this morning they were still extinguishing the fire," said Pavlína Adamc, a spokeswoman for the Prague firefighters.
The quantity of harmful substances in the air, according to measurements, did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the cause of the fire are unknown.
Approximately 50 firefighters arrived in the area.
"It's a fire in a large-capacity tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network on the site, so we are stopping by means of a traffic line from the tanks," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the fire was complicated by a poorly functioning hydrant network, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The fire department has declared a second level of fire alarm.
There are four degrees, and in the most serious situations, a fourth is declared.
Chemicals were also sent to the scene to check the level of hazardous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
"But they did not target a quantity of harmful substances in the air that would exceed hygienic standards," a spokeswoman for the firefighters said.
British police issue extradition notice to Assange
British police have delivered a notification on extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had received a “extradition notice” asking him to arrive at the police station and that if he did not do so, he could be arrested.
Assange has exhausted his options under the British law when the Supreme Court withdrew his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard “delivered a notification of extradition to a 40-year-old man asking him to arrive at the police station on the day and hour that was assigned to him,” a spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the notification of extradition.
Assange is concerned that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face accusations of espionage after publishing 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on WikiLeaks.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with hot drinks between his legs.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on A120 in Braintree.
When police stopped him, he found that he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
In a police court in Colchester, Howie admitted to the charges that he was driving carelessly and carelessly.
He received seven points on his account, which resulted in a six-month ban.
Howi was also ordered to pay the costs of £90 and a charge of £100 for the accused.
As a result of tax on foreign property owners breaks the London bubble
The Ministry of Finance has preliminarily quantified the income tax on financial assets, but is awaiting Mr Osborne’s final decision, who introduced a 7% transfer fee for buildings over £2 million in the 2012 budget and annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the property transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: “Given the increase in property transfers in high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is low taxed regardless of the effect of an outdated head tax system.”
He added that “this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy property in London, or existing owners to be reluctant to sell it.”
Leading properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the wealthy band ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in central London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6 per cent from year to year, but were overshadowed by a thriving “domestic market” in which, according to the Savills survey, the southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) experienced growth.
Scientists have more illuminated how tail movements are related to the mood of a dog
Previous research has shown that happy dogs turn their tail more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs mow their tail mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can notice these subtle differences in tail movement and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
The same was observed in other species.
Like humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-hand movements and vice versa, and these two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In an effort to obtain more information about how dogs react to other dogs’ disproportionate tail drilling, researchers monitored animals who watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t take long to understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We promised dog films – whether in a natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the tail movement to show it more to the right or to the left.”
When the animals saw the otherwise vague dog moving its tail to the right (from the sight of the dog spinning its tail), she remained completely calm.
But when she saw her tail shooting mostly to the left (again from the sight of a dog spinning with a tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted unsure.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would communicate consciously with each other through these movements.
Instead, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and must not pay attention to.
He said, “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement to the right produces less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of that experience.”
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and practitioners better understand the emotions of their pets.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a college professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their head to the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another study from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “The dogs were more likely to get acquainted with a dog robot when it turned its tail to the left rather than to the right, when they were more likely to become insecure – exactly the opposite of an Italian study.”
The difference may be given by the fact that dogs in these different studies did not interpret animals in movies or dog robots entirely like dogs.
He explained that it could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“Al there is solid evidence for many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to notice their behavior, it probably won’t take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Arctic Monkeys postponed their concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform on Friday at the Hydro City Complex.
But the illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to move the performances.
The announcement came after the group was similarly forced to postpone Thursday’s performance at LG’s Birmingham Arena.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to postpone today’s performance at LG Arena in Birmingham and on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1.”
“Alexi Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately he will not be able to speak out.”
LG will perform at the Birmingham Arena on November 20 and at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these shows remain valid.

Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope and are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis will set up his first group of men who will eventually help select his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group is thus reduced to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of current cardinals known as the Consistory will be held before the solemn promotion of the new cardinals.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals elected by February is likely to decline.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant, as it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope is nominating cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first cardinal election since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
“Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that these cardinals would be asked by the Pope for advice.
We have not been in this situation before – this is entirely new.
Valero said popes have traditionally promoted bishops from major places to cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is naming.”
GM recalls some new light trucks in the U.S. for seat repairs
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. Automotive Safety Authority, General Motors is recalling 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty trucks to fix the manually folded rearback fault.
In some of these vehicles, the tilt mechanism of the front seats may be faulty.
As a result, seat supports do not comply with the federal automotive safety standards for head supports.
A notice placed on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that “if a car gets a collision from the rear, the head support may not properly protect the passengers, which increases the risk of an accident.”
The removed models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the car in June, and for the leading American automaker, this is the most important vehicle launch since its restructuring and bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the supplier owner of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not review the notification to owners due to a 16-day government shutdown that weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were revised for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models.
The New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Obama's Voters' Scream
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama’s sincere efforts hindered the Republican Party’s obstruction
Obstructive policy cannot excuse Obama’s health care websites or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I read a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would encourage me during the cloudy days of my second year at the medical school and restore a little bit of hope in me.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and is a reminder of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish patient reviews at night and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath.
The election ended in overwhelming predominance, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying of joy and my parents were hiding the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries went to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When he took office in 2008, Obama had 82% of the support.
Here I close the book.
Going into the present is a harsh awakening, like going out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember those optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I dropped my first ballot, there have actually been changes.
It was definitely nothing of what I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied achievements – from the law on affordable care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy of “don’t ask, don’t say anything” to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that party obstruction has reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among others, immigration reform, the opportunity for the public to choose health care, and the closure of the Guantanamo base.
But after many times defending the Obama administration before colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
Republican obstructions cannot explain the consent to listening to foreign leaders or to drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the fact that the National Security Agency is collecting data about the private lives of Americans, nor the fact that it is pursuing those who reveal the misconduct of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwara al-Awlaqi, a U.S. citizen, without a proper trial, or for restricting public contributions and spending during the presidential campaign.
They cannot justify the report’s findings that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently they can’t even excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on affordable care of a simple website.
I don’t know if something like this could be expected.
Were I supposed to know at the age of 18 that government power could be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it?
The elected position obviously has no predictable course and our public interviews will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above seem to be largely the result of the administration’s own decision.
That troubles me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and out-of-the-box alternative and seemed to be unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that Obama’s second term, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we once heard of.
Nevertheless, going back to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming more and more difficult through this book.
It reminds me of the many promises that have been made.
This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a overwhelming defeat against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
“I want my magic back,” he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, and I totally agree with you.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are exclusively the opinions of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over parental leave program
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over his parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is running a dispute over the payment of a $6 million tax on coal, made this claim as he tried to remove the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer’s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect coal and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott’s daughters were in a position where they could have a personal benefit from the policy.
"He's got into a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters get pregnant, he'd be directly interested in whether she would get parental leave," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the election commission, after counting the votes, officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the battle for a seat for the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast region with a gain of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the polling stations?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can come, tap the details on your computer, vote immediately and have results at half seven in the evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark voting tickets.
Is it possible to ignore the results if someone doesn’t like them?
These days and at this time, the use of pens seems incredible.
The Election Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion together with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political agenda also covers airports in the Sunshine Coast area and that he would take his new job “very seriously.”
A public office is a service to the public.
“We are not seeking any reward other than being able to serve society at this critical time,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands can change your mood.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two had the task of solving an unsolvable task.
Both of course failed.
But the group that washed their hands after failure was much more optimistic than the group in which the participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group “washed hands” performed better in the next test than the other.
Those who washed their hands had worse results than those who did not wash their hands.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants had no previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical purity actually removes negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation decreases, and the testers have to concentrate much more on further tests.
If we transfer the results of the research to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic when we return from the toilet.
Only one percent of Czechs and Czechs don’t wash their hands after using the toilet, but a fifth of them are traveling by public transport.
Most people also stick to hygiene after work in the garden or at the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Chewing a pet motivates 78.7% of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks as to how much it is necessary to wash their hands after giving hands to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3% of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey found that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Al it would be in place, I fear that the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," commented the results of the survey skin doctor Klaudie Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that global surveillance investigations into suspected currency market machinations are becoming more and more common.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities on investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where they change owners of $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders mentioned would be the first RBS employees suspended as part of an expanding investigation in response to the scandal of manipulating the LIBOR (London Interbank Interbank Rate).
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
“Our unwavering investigation in this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event that RBS had handed over to the UK Financial Conduct Authority records of emails and instant messages sent from and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Exchange Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi’s European cash trading chairman, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were charged with any offence.
Mr. Usher’s messaging group included banks from Barclays and Citigroup, people dedicated to the event said.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced it was investigating suspicious currency manipulations in several Swiss banks, it took action against some of its employees.
Worldwide, at least six agencies – the European Commission, the Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations that these bankers have joined forces to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are scratching out years-old instant messages and emails to find cases of violations.
Investigation reports have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest engines for making profits in investment bank closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by arguing that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market it is basically impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this may not necessarily be true.
The high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign currency trading, scratching liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader from its stock trading department this week, causing a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the competent authorities and shall cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
“We believe that this trader acted on his own and that this problem has been solved,” Credit Suisse said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague has exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of surveillance in 1986 until the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to the statistics of the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the State Institute of Health.
To date, 2,063 people have been infected in the Czech Republic.
In 396 the disease of immunodeficiency has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has increased every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
A total of 156 new cases were identified in 2009 and 180 in 2010.
Last year, the number fell to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the laboratory, there were 212.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavatý, an expert on AIDS, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
Since the start of the follow-up until the end of September, HIV tests have been confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS outbreak occurred in 161 men and 37 women.
The most affected were in Prague.
Anyone who wants to get to know the city should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the center with monuments, churches, and galleries, more than would reveal a buffalo.
Many people read from the graves.
They slowly wander through the cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what faiths, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their taste is.
And from the state of the graves they will also see how the survivors care for their dead.
Supreme Court Approves Obama’s Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, a crucial victory for the Obama administration.
With a 5:4 vote ratio, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Available Care Act – which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or otherwise risk paying a fine – is not in conflict with the constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
Court Chairman John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also endorsed the remainder of the 2,700-page law and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care that orders states to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise threatening to deprive all federal funding for sickness insurance, is not coercive and unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primaries, the law was strongly rejected by each of the main Republican candidates, including the alleged proposed candidate Mitte Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a bullshit donkey" no longer threatens jail, court repealed the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to the public speech about the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s and has been in power since the end of 1987.
According to Paragraph 33 of the Criminal Code, defamation of the presidential office could be fined with up to $100 to one year in prison.
"The prosecutors should not fiercely blame people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal against the court’s decision, the BBC.
A number of injured Zimbabwéans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president during a quarrel with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist who blasphemed Mugabe in public with a "balled donkey" ended up in jail.
In August, the prosecutor accused a 26-year-old man of using a poster with Robert Mugabe’s face as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting the freedom of the press.
“The state cannot punish people whose statements later prove to be false,” said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law allowed anyone to disclose false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law allowing criminalization for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to freedom of expression,” Malala said.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, in March Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties on the basis of a referendum.
The country took small steps away from the one-man dictatorship in 2009 when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the chair of prime minister.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the world’s highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Currently, only foreign currencies are used in Zimbabwe.
Mugabe’s agricultural reforms are undermined.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with farming.
Central banks will keep swap lines permanent
Interim and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the U.S. Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument allowing banks access to global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks said this in a joint statement.
"This is a very reasonable step," said Julian Callow, the chief international economist at Barclays Bank in London.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is not a surprise in my opinion," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist of BH Securities.
The central banks are strengthening the bonds that began in 2007, when the international credit market was first shaken.
Central banking agreements gave access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers’ decision comes at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its U.S. economy-support program, which could push the price of money even higher on the global market.
A swap contract is typically used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency at the same time the liquidity surplus of another currency.
It can be understood as a storage of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is trying to regain confidence in European banks.
The European Central Bank (ECB) will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not)washes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
But I did not finish this, because someone was sitting on the branch who could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I did not want to drive to another branch, registration failed, then I moved and thanks to this I changed my address and ID number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it could not be done because I had a different OP number, address, and that it simply could not be completed, and that I had to request data deletion and make a new registration.
I did so and on 24 October 2013 I wrote to technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database according to the applicable data protection law.
On that day, the technical support wrote to me that I had to complete the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of emails to technical support, where they finally wrote after the 4th hurricane on 25 October that personal data was deleted on my request.
One would then say that he could do that new registration and here started again problems first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but finally they eliminated this too).
So I used a different username and it came to me that my personal data has already been saved in order to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have saved something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
On my question how is it possible, they sent me a letter that the personal data was actually deleted on 25.10. and I sent an email with the error.
I did this yesterday (around 5 p.m.) and it was written to me today that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13:22 and that therefore it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
I’ve been contacting technical support for a week now and I’ve not been able to do it yet.
And what if it was true what it claims (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional email and telephone number and the world wondered, a page appeared to me that emailed me a link to complete the registration.
How is it possible to register with the same name and date of birth?
Maybe because Tipsport links the registration to the e-mail and phone number and the data just didn’t go out as it claims.
So again, I told the technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they are writing) because what they are writing is not true.
I documented several screens that the problem with the registration was already before 31.10 so the "fake" registration simply does not affect this.
To that Tipsport wrote me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but because you're already registered again, we can't check your claims.
Communication has ended.
Respectively, it repeats the same sentence over and over again that the registration is bound by the name and date of birth.
They can’t even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and so it didn’t actually happen.
If I summarize that, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as it claims, but still lies when it claims the opposite.
What’s worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got a little moving and from the Technical Support came an email that the matter is being passed for verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and argumentation and notice of the same error).
Music on the Bridge
The Prague Transportation Enterprise (DPP) has launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule where reproduced instrumental music continuously plays during the operation of the subway is the A-line bridge at the exit to Václavské náměstí.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček presents his new double album, band and three singers
Textist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne City Community House not only his completely new two-CD Český kalendár, but especially in the program Between Us singers Lenka Nová, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the outstanding Orchestra of Matěje Benka.
After the introductory intru and acting essay about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded him of the story about how they last played in Cologne and in the theater and the entire city fell electricity.
“Otherwise, in Cologne, they produced two kinds of cards, with which I came into contact a lot,” he recalled.
This was also stated by President Zeman.
"Maybe we could make a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravce near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical performance.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on an orloj, about ice hockey but at the time he did not know anything, how we meet on those squares and scandate, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That’s the name of one song from the Czech Calendar, but we won’t play it here today,” he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, from this record sang for him much suitable Sleep in the day, sing at night and accompanied him on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played a percussion, all three singers were then accompanied by a band composed of a keyboard, a violoncello, a guitar and a counter bass.
All three vocalists together sang a bit of the odrhovačka to the side of the heart sits, which immediately spread the spotlight.
"I am glad that you were interested in the song, which did not surprise me in Kmochovo city," Michal Horáček replied.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I recognize in the presentation of Františka Segrada, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with huge applause, Hanu Heger was reminded of the song Dad loved Lida Baar and Horáčkov's explanation about the Communist ban and replacement of Baar by American actress Mae West.
The composer, Michael Kocáb, was reminded of the song Sebastián, and Segrado sang the beautiful song Prague by Jardou Svobodou, a native of Zamoula and a former Kolíňák.
This was a conclusion, a standing applause and an add-on in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
There was one more add-on on the playlist, but the fans did not applaud it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire four seated at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček his books and even the cover of the legendary LP and with potential interested people took a photo.
Berdych will be complemented by Rosol and Hájek
In the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil nominated four players Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czechs are defending the trophy, but they go to play on the opponent's field to the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from November 15 to 17.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
“We know we’re going to the hot ground, it’s going to be wild, and we have to concentrate on our performance as usual.”
"We will go there with a single goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the winner of last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American Command in Libya.
Top Gun in the Persian Gulf.
Israel has demonstrated exactly how the bombing of Syria is supposed to look.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, the aircraft hit the target and returned.
They will not allow themselves to shake off the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of Obama’s confused and bigotry, unsupported Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the entire attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don’t be misled by the media by their claims that “Syrian base” or “supplies for Hezbollah” have been bombed.
Recently I wrote here that while U.S. aid to the secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetorical level, Russia joyfully continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh shipment of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakia that became the target of the Israeli airstrike.
A clear message.
And note, Israel once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although according to popular internet theories it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government honored two members of the space units, probably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they were honored during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA site in the city is known, I think they were members of the secret CIA command, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in the CIA residence located elsewhere.
Now it is clearer.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine guns (just on one such, both members of the SEALs were killed after a machine gun attack) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. Command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, made their way to the CIA site in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is blamed by the fact that during that attack the command was not deployed officially and entirely and that it simply hesitated what to do.
The commander of the command, so without orders apparently will release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that there are not one-time, but permanent U.S. commandos, CIA agents and private contractors in the country is quite interesting information.
Until recently, nothing of this was officially acknowledged, and even now we are only talking about a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it’s good that the U.S. is even halfway trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
In order to solve this problem, the aid would be much greater.
The last place of a secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian Air Force for chasing U.S. drones.
However, little is known about how the Americans are effectively protecting their drones.
Of course, if you accidentally find your drone in the airspace, nothing can be done about it.
But if an Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing a U.S. drone in international space above sea, when there was the first sharp deployment of the U.S. super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew under the Phantom to visually verify his weaponry without the Phantom registering it on the radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared to him and urged the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without rattling.
It is not surprising that the Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but it remembers the Vietnam War.
It cannot be compared to Raptor.
We want to show that we can still win, Rajtoral promises.
This is a bit of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful in the last few years, defender or backback Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He is also successful in shooting, he is active, after the intervention on him was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplicích.
Victoria reached victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplices, but in the end of these two duels took only one point.
František Rajtoral believes that his team in the match with Jablonec will break the unpleasant series.
We want to show that we can win.
“I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home,” promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match against the Northern Czechs, who play offensive football.
Everything is headed to the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always, we draw a lot from the video game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative attracts fans to the Doosan Arena.
Plzni’s last matches didn’t go as she would like, but the word of crisis defender Victoria rejects.
That’s how it is in football, sometimes you’re in good shape and sometimes you’re worse.
But I’t talk about the crisis.
“I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again,” said the defender.
The team will again rely on the support of the fans.
“It’s playing on Friday night and I want to invite our fans, who are great.”
“I believe we will be grateful to them for their victory,” Rajtoral added.
John Peterson: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it’s not really a step, it’s a big leap – a few years back, into my memories, into my childhood.
It’s a memory of what it was like, not having any worries and just coming out of school and washing dishes, luxurizing and doing tasks.
Although these "duty", it was mostly only the theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - to run out of school, throw a bag in the corner, and run out.
Play with other children ball games, jump drinks.
Then during the series Helena and her boys wrap a chain seam solemn toothbrush for grandmother’s birthday.
And only then after several warnings to finally wash the dishes, to luxurize, in the winter to put wood into the stoves and to do tasks until after darkness under the lamp (or to rely on a classmate and instead of tasks to write loving verses addressed to school love).
In the morning to eat home strawberry marmelade (from real fruit, not those strawberries that are sold now, whose content beside strawberries did not lie) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mom and I so loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room, when my sister and I recorded songs from the radio on cassettes that were loudly rotated in the old cassette after my mom.
And then we rolled the cassettes over on the pencil and put one song back and forth, our favorite, and drank it with a siphon.
Or we were talking over the table with the help of canes that were tied to each other by a rope – and when we were already on the phone, in order to hear better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, the earpiece at the time was sirka + cotton.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now and my parents were able to live out of it so that we didn’t lack anything.
We didn’t need any of those iPhones, iPads or even mobile phones and laptops or branded clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "add-on" to the closet was a batiked T-shirt of domestic production with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with the mentioned mom cassette and at most the Walkman, which we shared with my sister and which, by the way, we used only in the train on a school trip.
It came to us more interesting to play with my aunt the Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said to go "only" out.
When I was a little older we got a video player under the tree, surely my parents saved it for a long time, but unfortunately it didn’t heat up for a long time.
My younger sister snapped the scratch into it, saying it was so beautifully tapping the cassettes, so she tried to see if it also tapped the scratch.
He fell asleep, but it was his last bite.
This is what my father still has on his plate.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she narrated the straw into the video and thought she would play the recipe and did not play it, so she still can't cook it.
I remember how we were able to communicate together, talk without a cell phone, computer.
Together with my sister we agreed with the grandmother's granddaughter on vacation with the neighbor's granddaughter, when we will meet again next year in the summer with grandmothers - and so it was, so it was.
We met together.
Do you promise to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when we and the whole village ran outdoors, built snowmen, and ran on the snowed hill near the church on sacks filled with snow.
We ate dinner with the family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I heard the notorious phrase before every dinner: “Wash your hands!”
Yes, this is true today, but you definitely don’t have soap in the lemon grid tied to the tap in the bathroom.
After dinner, when my daddy was "working" at a beer in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay on the floor, laid our feet on the stove, opened the doors and looked at the flame and listened to the cracking wood that ran out of the stove.
We were closer – really – we didn’t count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together – we spoke – we didn’t write messages on a daily basis through various chats, SMSs.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
And I could continue this way for a long time.
It’s beautiful to remember, especially if I complement these memories by viewing albums where the black-and-white photos are smoothly grafted with black corners.
And if I didn’t know how old I was then, behind the photo is always written the year of the photograph.
I see that although the cut-offs according to the pot did not suit us very much and in addition we had the trousers after the brother-in-law two numbers larger, nobody laughed to us before, it was so normal (not IN).
I’d rather go back to that one step, to reality.
By 2013 and I’ll wait to see what modern times will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories are now for the young teenage generation so at least somewhere "a hundred years after the monkey" and I think they are going to lose a lot that they will not experience this "precipient" time too.
I wish it to them!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents for Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit on Thursday against mobile phone makers including Google, a company it had overpriced during the auction of Nortel’s bankruptcy.
Rockstar Consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas for breaches of the patent.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with violating seven patents.
Patents include a technology that helps link search terms searched on the Internet with relevant advertising, the lawsuit says, which is at the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which is heavily competing with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a standard $900 million offer for Nortel’s patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the Nortel patent battle, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal partly motivated by a group of Motorola patents.
“Despite the failure to attempt to obtain the disputed patents at auction, Google has violated patents and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation from Google because it claims that Google has intentionally infringed a patent, as claimed in the lawsuit.
Miloslava Cejpková: November Smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not used to yet.
At first she laid off a smile, the one she was always showing up as a defense against the friendly surroundings.
This made her very relieved, because it was a mask that she decided not to postpone in public.
He was honest at home only in the days when she had grandparents and grandchildren Elinka or Adíka around her.
And, of course, her kids were calling.
She remembered very well the lesson from the endless courses of business skills.
Now they finally really fit.
Not to upset your closest.
Then he flew into the corner.
Like a dress in a mascara.
Neither November nor any other month can do that miracle to make them smile really, as they did when they were on a trip with someone who hasn’t been here for almost three years.
Egypt announces first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi has sworn in, but his triumphant day will hardly end political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was solemnly put into office as the country’s first freely elected president, after Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months earlier.
Mursi became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore in front of 18 judges dressed in black plates in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today have laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with a U.S. degree and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by governments for most of its 84 years as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small car column shortly after 11 a.m. local time, hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the court building to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidency, the traffic was only briefly stopped so that the column could pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs in the south.
Morsi’s personal prestige, ridiculously referred to as the non-charismatic “reserve tire” of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech aimed at presenting him not only as an Islamist candidate, but also all those who want to bring an end to the uprising against Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wooden chamber where he swore.
Morsi went to Cairo University to deliver an inauguration speech.
While standing on guard, he was officially welcomed by a military band playing the national anthem.
The military commander, Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi, was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the scandals “the army and the people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the site of the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly vowed to regain the presidential powers removed from his office by the military council that took them over from the dismissed leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath in court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he submitted to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power would continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There will be police specialists in the ghettos to ease tensions.
In the future, police specialists will work in ghettos in the Czech Republic.
They would spend half of their time here.
They would keep order and solve problems.
Through their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs counts with this.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would be mainly helped by "accelerating social housing provision".
The document was discussed by the government.
A few years ago, there were about 300 poor homes and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic.
There were about 80,000 people living there, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families depended on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
Bujala Lihava.
According to experts, the number of problems has increased by a hundred.
Relationships between the people and others are increasing.
Anti-Roman marches were held in several places.
People from the surroundings also joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is difficult for police to maintain security and order in ghetto areas.
The main requirement is “the consistent application of equal treatment in law enforcement”.
This cannot be achieved without detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
A specialist would go on trips in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled place, he would keep order.
He would also know the local, so he could better solve problems or violations.
“Thanks to trust, specialists will be able to prevent a whole range of illegal acts more easily,” the ministry said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive a surcharge of 500 to 1000 CZK per month.
The introduction of special police officers in troubled areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is approximately EUR 600,000 (now approximately SEK 15.5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations have begun this year, and a detailed proposal is currently being prepared.
The project will last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded locations is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
“There are so-called Roma settlements here,” the authors of the report said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will identify the places where a special policeman would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.
According to the proposal of the project, the first selected police officers will have an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen students will be trained each year.
These are the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for police officers working in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior, there would be three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with precise rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be social housing, which would be comparable to ordinary housing.
Employers would have to complete an integration plan, which would be drafted with them by social workers.
They would have to adhere to accommodation rules, take care of their health, send their children to schools, re-qualify and actively seek work.
If they were to try to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of housing.
The housing system should be operational for at least 30 years until the next generation grows up in a pro-integration-motivated environment.
The social housing model is prepared by resorts for local development and work.
They have to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Coal Mount - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The coal peak is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Together with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník at a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruption was at the beginning of the quarter.
When viewed from a greater distance, on the top of Uhlířský vrchu is a striking white painted Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary of Help, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
It replaced the original wooden chapel.
The house that stood next to the church did not survive.
Shortly after the church was completed, an aley of four rows of lip was planted, about 1 km long.
The Cross Road on Uhlířský vrch is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second one lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden plastics made by the local artistic carpenter František Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the area of the Low Autumn.
Similarly, the substrate of the rocks from the area forms an interesting geological exposition.
Each stop includes the name of the sponsor.
The mountains are the remains of a young volcano.
Although data from radiometric age measurements vary slightly, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is thus younger than the Great Rood (age 3.3 million years) and older than the Venus volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
During it, a considerable amount of volcanic ashes was spilled out, along with fragments of rocks from the substrate, which gained a red-brown color by burning.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous chandeliers up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption sparked red, brown-red and in places black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters, and its part is accessible in the wall of the breakdown.
In the tuffs are noticeable volcanic pumps up to 1 meter large, and the second eruption ended with a lava spill.
At the end of the activity, the lava flowed out of the volcano, which today forms up to 50 meters of a powerful layer of strawberry.
Volcanoes that alternate volcanic ash with lava are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually made up of layers, they are called stratovulcanoes.
The original volcanic cone gradually underwent erosion.
However, it was threatened by the mining of rocks on the southern side.
The most intense mining took place between 1953 and 1962.
Toughs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining was stopped under the pressure of experts and the public, thereby preserving this unique place.
The problem, however, lies in the porosity and small cohesiveness of the rocks, which quickly wind up, break down and descend down the slope.
The breakout disappears relatively quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-oriented slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The remedy is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles areined in a number of important locations.
You can get to Uhlířský vrch by the green tourist label from Bruntál, or from Slezský Kočov.
Motorists can use the unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the Lip Avenue, where a short trail begins.
She moved from the house to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas on Ořechovce.
The original owners of the house, however, got it back in restitution and tenants had to move away with a small fee.
Ivana was therefore quick to find a replacement home for herself and her then older mother.
From acquaintances she received a tip on an apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and the fence, on the other hand, impressed me," Ivana recalls the first impression.
At first, I thought it would be for three years.
"Today we have been living here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction I would not change," adds the owner.
The mother and daughter then moved from a twenty-two-metre apartment to a smaller with an area of 62 square meters and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not easy, things were stored with friends and gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be made, such as painting doors or replacing windows.
The previous owner broke out the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractical and unnecessarily large hallway, and, on the contrary, a small bathroom.
The two rooms are combined to create a multifunctional living space.
The architects used a plaster cardboard to define the individual zones and to divide the room, enabling a new location of the lights.
The first intervention, which she decided to take after a few years, was to remove the compartment in the living room.
This changed the disposition of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airspace and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards a partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC flooring with laminate flooring.
Ivan did not know the bathroom.
I’ve spent years searching for magazines and searching for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting implementation.
So I referred to the young architect Kamil Douderova.
“It was actually the most important step for the future,” says Ivana.
Thanks to the rebuilding of the bathroom, the disposal of the front seat was also modified.
The architect combined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with opening wings with some sliding ones, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and barrier-free.
The quality plates imitate the sandstone, in the shower there is a comfortable seat, at the clozet a bidet sprinkle.
The successful collaboration with Kamil Douderova continued.
As part of the program How to Build a Dream, a rapid but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, which was also attended by the architect Martin Čeněk.
In the space, which was created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without using the classic principles of optical division, such as half-diamonds or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a violation of the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
The bedroom and living room were separated.
It was enough to turn the back of two sofas to each other and put a tailor-made pearl box between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and paint.
The architect used a high-quality marmoleum on the floor in the kitchen and dining room, reviving the sliding door with a pattern wallpaper.
The kitchen corner is covered by sliding panels with wallpaper if necessary.
The new anti-allergic marmoleum floor has a number of advantages compared to the previous laminate floor: a softer non-sliding surface without scars and better sound insulation.
The system of gips-carton blades and blades highlighted with color is a demonstration of how space can be worked in the panel.
I left the colors to the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
“I like the orange, the same shade I had in the previous apartment,” says Ivana.
The graphoscale cloth with the motto of the flourishing magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To a warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were stored, among other things, in the space under the windows.
Everything is at hand, the lights are comfortably controlled remotely.
In the renovated interior, the contrast between the new and the older works perfectly, such as the decades-old crystal luster and the high-quality art objects that Ivana collects throughout her life.
The kitchen came last.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides and the owner felt a bit like in a tunnel.
The architect picked up the number and arranged the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is made on the order, the white surface is smoothed by a slightly pearl surface.
They fit into the small space thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, dryer and washing machine.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the whole glass walls above the workboard.
The unique graphic glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is wellined.
Ivana chose the flowers of the magnolia, which remind her of the favourite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
She seems to be happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathroom and a dishwasher, to the new owner chose a neutral shade of cloth.
The large shower room has a Ronald glass door.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the given environment, in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We unified the interior material and colour and tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
"A further condition for the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the reachability of everyday objects," adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court ruled that he could be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Peter Nečas can also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the August dissolution of the House of Representatives.
He was protected only by the procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksy, Mark Šnajdra and Peter Tluchoře, on the contrary, decided that they cannot be punished for possible crimes until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, said the Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
The court with this decision rejected the proposal of the prosecutor Iva Ištvana, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the MPs.
They accepted bribery in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and not making trouble approving laws.
Instead, the former prime minister who offered them these positions can be prosecuted.
The police also arrested an anti-corruption officer.
Bart’s lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, who represented him in the case of alleged corruption of MPs, also did not want to express too much about the case, but said: “Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but given the protection of classified facts, I can not further comment.”
The case is being handled by the General Inspection of Security Councils (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that Bárta may have purchased classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may be related to the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the office Bárta allegedly sought.
The latest information, however, shows that the arrest of Víta Bárta has nothing to do with Peter Lessy.
Police Presidium spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová declined to comment on the case with the fact that the case is being dealt with by the Prague City Council.
"This question will not be commented in any way with regard to the protection of classified facts," said the spokeswoman of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, Štěpánka Zenklová.
It is the local prosecutor who oversees Bart’s case, and from her words therefore indirectly follows that the file or criminal proceedings are kept in secrecy.
Reporter Novinek managed to catch his wife Kateřina Klasnova in the morning before their residence in Prague.
She put her suitcases in the car and left.
He refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, spoke about Bart’s arrest.
According to him, he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the election, he was not a member of the Sunrise of direct democracy Tomio Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who in the past early parliamentary elections in the Plzeňský kraj failed to run for the Dawn of direct democracy movement Tomio Okamura, is known for his corrupt cause of paying the deputies of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
The verdict was subsequently amended and Barta was acquitted of charges.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have lust and enthusiasm
For Prospala, the family was always on the first place, so he wants to fully submit to her at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job abroad and still extends his career, or he definitively stops playing hockey.
I want to play the role of father and husband.
“I’m looking forward to it,” says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite the fact that he is a proclaimed worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can thus strike his fellow players.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus in the past season.
“But the desire to show everybody in me is still there,” he announces resolutely.
The New York Rangers, who have failed to enter the season and also have two injured supports - attackers Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
How do you feel about coming to the Rangers?
It is just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, it’s not worth it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that’s all.
Nowhere has it been said that this really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce that I have a contract, but this is not the case.
Have you been contacted by the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place day-to-day.
It’s about getting into a situation where the deal really comes.
When a player is injured or it doesn’t work and the manchaft doesn’t.
There are a lot of different factors that must come together in order to get this contract.
But the same thing happens in New York, isn’t it?
Injured is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn’t get into the season, so there’s a chance, don’t you think?
Of course, that chance is always there.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I would have received a lot of offers today, but I haven’t received any so far.
Unfortunately, this is the reality I have to live in.
You’re going to America on Friday and you’re expecting something to happen.
I have those expectations since July 5, when the free player market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
I’m going to Tampa for my kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and see you again.
Do you have your program planned?
He is given by the fact that I am a father and a husband, and it all comes from that.
I’m not a hockey player at the moment – I don’t have a contract and I don’t play matches.
So I’m going to play the role of a father and a husband and I’m looking forward to it.
On Sunday, Vašík has two hockey matches, which is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time imports?
One can think about a lot of things.
This too can happen.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches because of my knee surgery.
I it a lot and a lot.
One day it will get to such a stage that all the goals, wins and breakthroughs will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that’s the meaning of life.
Have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could have had besides my family.
Have you had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play in the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Because I am a hockey player, the first place, in addition to my family, is sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
This also depends on family life.
My children, so forgive me, our children – my wife and mine – grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
We would be very happy if this trend continued.
In America, the possibilities are somewhere else.
We should give them such a chance.
Do you want to stay in America forever?
We will practice as we have done so far.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic on the Hluboké and in the surrounding Czech Budějovic.
And in the winter again in Tampere or where our steps will lead us.
It is perfect to always be warm.
I had great luck in my life.
You can say that I went in front of him, it cost me a lot of strength and rejection, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey has offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
We can choose where we will live.
There are a lot of people in the world who desire this so they can choose what to do and how to live.
How long will you have in your age the will to work, train hard and wait for an offer?
Yes, that’s a question I can’t answer.
Today I still have it in myself, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for that sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have in the NHL, that I am always better than anyone else.
But I cannot say how long it will stay there.
It cannot be planned.
So you can say that you wait this season and then decide what to do next.
I am in a phase where I go day by day.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th blocks of the Temelín power plant was postponed for the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and approving Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. to the majority shareholder.
A qualified manager should give recommendations to shareholders, not hide behind them.
Government only with Sabbath.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to reconcile that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that it will have to go straight into the government in order to create any.
This was stated by the President in an interview that will be released tomorrow.

Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport due to shooting
A shooting occurred at Los Angeles International Airport.
Police evacuated part of the airport, allegedly the third terminal.
Reuters, citing media outlets in California, said law enforcement officers shot a gunman.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to police, said there was a shooting in which two to three traffic safety officers were injured.
How many people were injured and whether there were any casualties is still unclear.
Firefighters say there are more people injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The Russian missiles were targeted by Hezbollah.
Israeli aircraft allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
This was by an unnamed U.S. government official on CNN.
The Israeli press broadly about the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the attack on it was not confirmed by the Israeli government.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli army, asked by CNN, declined to comment on the report.
“We do not comment on foreign media reports,” she said.
According to a U.S. government source, the Israeli airstrike targeted missiles and related equipment that Israelis believe could be transported to the Lebanese militant Hezbollah.
AP, citing another U.S. security official, that the target of the Israeli strike on a target in Syrian territory were Russian SA-125.
Another Israeli television channel that the target of the attack was supposedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the area of the attack, however, according to the DPA agency showed a battery of Russian missiles type S-125 Nev.
In addition, they said they saw batteries of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with a radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to Israeli television reports, the missiles have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry heads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has allegedly bombed missile supplies inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP said.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will interfere with any weapons supplies to Hezbollah or other groups identified as terrorist.
Is the Internet the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to successfully resist this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from recreators in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base profit before tax to range between $325 million and $340 million, up from $305 million to $315 million from its previous forecast.
If the current trend isined, this will represent a twelve to seventeen percent increase from a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an eight-percent profit in the first half of the year and began the second half of the year with a sharp growth especially in Australian and British non-business travel.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards record-breaking annual profits before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Recreational business rose in Australia during the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
U.S. trade recovered after losses during the seasonally weaker half of the year and is expected to bring a third consecutive year-round profit.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia sent to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protests against planned oil mining in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was by AFP with reference to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original charges of piracy against its activists have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after a nonviolent action against an oil platform in the Arctic have been transported from a repair facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned relocation.
The authorities initially accused the environmentalists of piracy, for which they could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace the charges with a lighter incest, with a lower sentence of up to seven years in prison.
Greenpeace said in a statement that allegations of piracy have not yet been filed as promised.
This means that the detainees are now charged with two crimes.
The Powerful Committee for Investigation announced last week that it would replace the allegations of piracy with the allegations of extortion.
But when thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the allegations of piracy were not withdrawn.
Instead, new charges were raised against each of them," a statement from Greenpeace quoted AFP as saying.
Russian authorities detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil platform in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on board the Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have filed an appeal, but the court has rejected them all.
The environmentalists are complaining about the conditions of detention.
Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg would make it easier for detainees to meet with their families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
“They can actually be worse,” he warned.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, has asked King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to talk about their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Maliki plays a big part in the resumption of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At the English literature lessons, you will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a novel from the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include “hidden text” to motivate for deeper reading;
Combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take a language graduation exam and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective subject.
The Ministry of Education is due to release a new curriculum for English and mathematics – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other major changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, which oversees maturity exams, will reveal changes in the maturity exam structure, along with a new scoring system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our exam system to regain the trust of society” and that it was necessary to insist that the graduation exam be “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours per year in mathematics, and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive maturity exam in mathematics – coupled with a greater emphasis on the subject in scores – is likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the Czech Republic
Before the elections, a long-running dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the Ostravan ČSSD burst out.
Everything culminated when mayor of Ostrava Petr Kajnar appealed to the court for the undemocratic preparation of candidates.
The actors of the case, however, did not want to speak too much to prevent the party from hurting even more before the elections.
The votes of the voters are now counted.
The leadership of the Ostravska ČSSD so on Monday evening called on the mayor of Ostravy to step out of the party, and will apparently push for him to lose his position.
Peter Cohen wants to continue.
Who is on whose side and what is on whose side, he explained in an exclusive interview with The Daily Mail.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The Dutch had hoped for a much better result.
Did it hurt us that there were disputes within the party in the media before the election?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election outcome.
On the other hand, this corresponds to the state in which the CPS is now.
It is a party that has internal problems, is internally sick, and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
This was clearly shown in the elections.
What are the internal diseases?
For some time, I think the ODS has been going through a decline, and unfortunately, similar things are now happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their pre-sales at ODS, have moved to people in the ČSSD and have an influence on them.
It is then related to the fact that the offices of the Ostrava magistrate are going by the police and collecting computers.
This shows that the CSDD is not made up only of people who want the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The ČSSD is also divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between the Hashkovs and the Sobotkovs.
This too has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a preview of what is happening now in Prague.
Hashkov's wing gradually occupied positions, so that after the election it could create a situation that would weaken Sobotkov's wing.
People are in a situation where they sometimes have to compromise.
Everyone has an internal boundary where it is impossible to make compromises, and this is also the case.
Initially, I did not want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get a regional candidate to strengthen Sobotkov’s wing as mayor of Ostravy.
But the wing stopped it.
Why do you stand on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not of Michal Hasko?
Slávek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a man who always speaks primarily about the ČSSD program and to a certain extent also about visions for the party and for this country.
I have not heard anything like this from the other side.
Michael Schumacher is fighting for power.
I don’t understand how the presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can just start to remove the party’s chairman.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the statutes of the party.
In my opinion, by what Michal Hašek now demonstrated in Prague, he ended his political career.
As you have noticed, you have not been approved by the OSSD leadership for the candidate.
Political parties are based on a competition for who of their members will be placed.
The competition should mostly be based on program vision and on the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, people who do not have a lot of capabilities or vision, but the political party is for them an elevator to money, which would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start getting in the forefront because of the fact that they ruthlessly violate the rules, violate the statutes of the party.
With their practices they make political parties into mafia and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To be aware of this problem is more important to me than to consider whether a Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
Therefore, did you submit a request to the court before the elections for a preliminary measure against the form of the candidate of the ČSSD in the Moravskoslezsky region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava strengthens its power by cancelling organizations that do not suit it, establishing new organizations with a purpose, and gradually throwing out uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarik from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then canceled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that seeking compliance with the statutes of the party through the courts is the last option, but when the other methods and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The attempt of the leadership of the Ostravska ČSSD headed by MP Adam Rykala is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruby Lumír Palyza is in charge of this post.
It is so, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to appeal me.
They promise positions to the people, they earn votes, and for those votes they consolidate their power in the party.
When I go back in the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was artificially instigated so that I could be described as a man who puts money where it does not belong.
The property has a strategic value for the city.
So what do you think of your continuation as mayor?
The district committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider staying in the ČSSD.
I think it’s like a thief shouting, “Catch the thief!”
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in the Ostrava Social Democracy who would initiate and promote, sometimes against members of the party, the creation of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a scientific and technological park.
Everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don’t read it otherwise than preventing others from getting to the places they want.
Will you continue to fight against these efforts?
In order for the country to function well, the political parties must also function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively manage a country if it does not know how to manage itself.
So I don’t consider leaving the CPSD now, because I think the one who is causing the cancer of this party is not me, but those people who are trying to get me out.
Olomouc opens public skyscraper in historic center
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Spálený said that the preparatory work on the slide was started on October 26 and since Wednesday the ice-making plant is in operation.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The slide has an area of 375 square meters, the stage has taken 358 square meters.
Officers and passengers will also have two stands with punches.
"We expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire floor area is covered so that skating can be comfortable," he described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminding us of Christmas.
Last year, the skyscraper was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square for the repair of the lower square.
The repair of the lower square was completed at the end of the summer so that the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people were able to burst directly in front of the town hall in 2009, when the slide was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will open on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of an elderly in Zlínsk will again be dealt with by the district court
The district court released the charges of the 25-year-old Slovak and the 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied guilt.
They could face 15 to 20 years in prison or a special sentence.
A spokesman for Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court revoked the decision of the district and returned the case to him again for hearing.
The judge declined to comment on the reasons, saying the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
The accused allegedly raped a 70-year-old man in his home.
The old man died a painful death.
According to the prosecution, the men slapped him, beaten him and kicked him all over his body, and also used a metal object, probably a gas pistol, to inflict about three dozen wounds on his head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as cranial bone fractures, brain swelling or brain bleeding, which he suffered on the spot.
The young men allegedly took from the house about 3000 kronor and jewelry worth about 14 thousand kronor.
According to the district court, the only, moreover, only indirect evidence against the defendants were odor traces, which the expert assessed as not fully detected in the sense of legal instructions.
Smell traces from the scene of the crime and on other matters in more than ten cases coincided with the accused, but the police initially treated them as material and not smell traces.
There were also errors in handling them.
According to the Senate, the accused’s guilt was not clearly proven.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he apparently fell and injured himself.
Not even the emergency services were notified of the deaths.
The criminals were contacted only a few days later by Olomouc doctors, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
Police could no longer work with all the traces from the scene of the crime, which relatives cleaned up.
No DNA was found on the scene.
A young Slovak lived in Uherskohradišťsk.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Olomouc last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men, who have been charged with theft into the gold industry.
The robberies occurred in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of an elderly man in Slopny.
The youngest of the accused for the murder of an elderly resides in Uherský Hradišť.
He was released from custody after 11 months in August.
Starts the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders who will do the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living Legend Wayne Shorter Closes Next Week Strings of Autumn
Saxophone giant and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make the next Wednesday the spot for the 18th annual Struny Autumn festival.
Shorter will perform in the Grand Hall of Lucerne on November 6 with his quartet Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be accompanied by the spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumžák.
In Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra, the song Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound, will sound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert at Strunah in autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade indicated the direction of a new style of fusion.
For the last 13 years, he has performed with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
The afterparty after the festival will be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the club Roxy/NoD.
Alongside the charismatic singer Andrey Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska will introduce the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The UEFA has banned the publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the arbitration committee of the Czech Football Association, has stopped publishing penalties for judges.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, she said in an interview with the newspaper Law.
Otherwise, he would be threatened with punishment.
Damková also refused to stand as a party to the footballers of Plzně, where she came from.
These speculations are really meaningless.
It is true that I live in Plzni, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example, from Prague.
So in the case of voting I can lose 1:6," said Damková in response to the criticism that erupted after Plzeň played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Though in recent months the FAČR has stopped publishing penalties for referees, Damková assures that the judges are pitying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds that the referee made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, whatever it was in any match," Damková said.
The reason why the penalties are not published, according to Damkov, is a ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and punishes violations harshly."
“We’re very suspicious and we’re looking for something behind every mistake.”
"We've been publishing restrictions, but I've received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop, there will be harsh sanctions," she said.
Other countries comply with the ban.
“We were really the exception,” she added.
If the disclosure continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
“And they are very important to us.”
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the education of referees," Damková added.
Arrest of Bárta is related to Janoušek and Bém: Are they behind the leakage of interrogations?
The police arrested the head of public affairs, Víta Bárta, on Thursday.
He was also arrested by the head of the anti-corruption police's analytics and informatics department, Jan Petržílek.
The arrest is related to the interrogation of the lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Béma (ODS).
The information about the intercept, with which the server Novinky.cz came, confirmed the Czech press office a trusted source.
The intercepted phone calls of Janouška and Béma, which were published by the newspaper Mladá fronta Dnes in March last year and in which the two men address each other "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show Janoušk's influence on the steps of the city under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper then that they were purchased in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which they escaped two years later to the security agency ABL.
At that time he owned the barracks.
Server Novinky.cz warned that the detained criminal Petržílek worked before his entry to the anti-corruption police for the BIS.
To the anti-corruption department, which subsequently dealt with the interrogation, Petržílek passed at the same time they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I can not confirm anything at all or say anything at all," Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the City Prosecutor's Office in Prague said.
He also refused to confirm that he was monitoring the case.
The police did not want to comment on the case for the same reason.
Six out of 10 companies are preparing for the new Civil Code.
Six out of ten companies are intensely preparing for the coming into force of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act from January 1, 2014.
Only eight percent of the companies surveyed said they had not addressed issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
With the approaching deadline for the two key codes, a number of managers are beginning to realize the significant impact they can have on their company’s business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually occur.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks to make the transition to the new law for their companies without complications," said Jan Spáčil, partner of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensely engaged in the new codes, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all necessary measures to prepare in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of companies from this number are about to take the necessary measures in the near future.
In contrast, one in five firms have not yet dealt with recodification, yet they have a concrete idea of how to prepare for it.
11% have no opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet resolved the issues related to recodification.
For the largest number of companies surveyed, the most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by the settlement of business terms (16 percent) and further changes in the property register and liability for damages (each ten percent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most significant innovations of the entire recodification will take place, namely the unification of the modification of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which contract law should become more transparent for citizens and.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many new features with an emphasis on greater freedom to organize relationships," said Lukáš Poddaný, lawyer at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In the context of the Law on Commercial Corporations, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the accountability of statutory bodies the most important issue.
Subjects related to changes in the convocation and course of the general meeting (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent) were followed.
The new legislation means tightening of obligations and possible consequences for statutory bodies, especially in situations where a company is at risk of bankruptcy or falls into bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the governing bodies and the executives of the companies do not act with the care of the proper owner and do not prevent the threatening collapse of the company, they can lose the benefit gained for the performance of the position only for the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier’s style evolve as a living language
My task is to preserve tradition while leading our brand to modern things, so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains in an interview with HN his position Pierre Rainero, Director of Style at Cartier.
This luxury French house was built in 1847.
Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one in 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 nominees for the CNN Hero of the Year Award 2013.
In the CNN Hero of the Year 2013 competition, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and ride to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the Cameroon capital Yaounde in 1981.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but subsequently he developed an infection that spread to the brain and formed a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money for it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals where he received treatment that was simply available.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle’s father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
For comparison, the rate in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if camerunese doctors could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line and three-quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
They cannot enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, it has helped 32,000 people with its group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush into trucks, attach medical supplies to the roofs, and travel through rough terrain to villages that need help.
It is not always accompanied by luck.
Sometimes vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his wide smile and untouched energy – is very willing to engage in the local fun.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each expedition,” says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical care.
Many are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get bars or gifted glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document that the school demands but that many impoverished families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually done in the school building, at the town hall or at home; after the operation, the patient stands up and goes to the recovery site to free up space for another patient.
With the help of the light from the generator, the operating room and the sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early in the morning.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To keep us awake and continue to work, they play drums all night,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students – carried out 700 free surgeries last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot for the local population.
One man said that after surgery his hernia will be able to work again.
“It will change the future of our family,” the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she actually sleeps,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and works as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He’s always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do those campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it’s a great practice they’t get at home.
“We washed Dr. Bwell’s hands thoroughly and removed the bloody spots or held his tools,” O’Malley says.
You will never experience this as a second year medical student in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon on their own and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
Once they arrive in Yaounde, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation and study.
“No doubt he’s a hero,” O’Malley says.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the constant upheaval is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy doing this job,” says Bwelle.
I think of my father.
I hope they see what I am doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holcát re-established the role of Chief Sister for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that this function is clearly defined and formalized so that nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be paid due attention from the Ministry.
The exercise of this profession requires not only high professional professionalism, but also human approach and personal convictions.
“I will be happy and responsibly working to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses.”
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients too much to carry out their vocations with all empathy and help us in the eyes of the public to improve the image of nurses," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Sister for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated that she wants to deal with various aspects of the work position of the nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
“I don’t want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but I see them standing side by side, each with their own competences and together with other healthcare professionals form a team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient.”
"I myself am faced with a number of problems that occur in the exercise of the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"From my own experience, I know that some administrative actions of nurses are unnecessarily burdened and take away time that they could and should devote to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas to be addressed include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve cooperation within the team and with the management of healthcare providers, adjusting competences, as well as labour law issues such as compliance with the labor code or not overwhelming nurses with their insufficient number at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous complaints, but for fear of possible punishment, they are not documented on a specific case where the violation of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the Principal Sister of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of preserving the anonymity of such a complaint and the specific case to let the competent authorities to check," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Ms. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Middle Medical School in the field of Nursing (absolved in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Karlovy v Praze in the degree program Nursing - Pedagogy (absolved in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been in charge of the department of nursing and other non-medical disciplines and recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the MFA.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bed at the internal department, as a teacher at the Middle Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as Chief Sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, devoted to lecturing activities in the field of nursing.
He is not a member of any political party.
Not to be hated
Writer Václav Kahuda has returned to writing after 12 years.
After years of reading, living, but not writing, Václav Kahuda (1965) releases a new novel Wind, Darkness, Present.
That it will not be a short volume, the number of pages is comparable to his most famous work Houština (Petrov, 2001).
The Salon Kahudu was attended by another prominent Czech writer of the present time - Emil Hakl.
What happened to you after twelve years of silence?
I did it – so as not to engulf myself in hatred.
To see around us new and new clones of that human foolish pettyness, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavors.
I don’t even talk about us the elderly, the ksichty ruined by powerless lust, the vekslácky souls and the opposite ideologists who try to sell their “product” with the expression of a small selling prostitute.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my rude friends, strangers, and hidden formations.
It has already passed me.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from life on this planet.
I like to go for a walk and read books at night.
You talk about feelings of destruction, hatred.
Has there been a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
It happened a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It had no name then.
And after that I lived.
Somewhere inside there is a quiet boy.
I see other lonely practitioners, each in his tornado of anxiety.
It saved me from writing books.
I participate in that enormous, thousands of years-long movement of the system of life on this planet—the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir to our presence.
We are the players of a sad and beautiful game where, by trial and error, new and new generations of beings are created, creating some supernatural, artificial intelligence in trillions of interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or have you started from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather, the dialogue that the right and left half of the brain lead, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
Just as periods of peace are carved with silent sleeping metastases of wars that may one day wake up, so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt the lava of life growing in my brain, and if I didn’t do anything, one day it would silently overwhelm me.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and placed in layers that are stored in the dark “under the level of consciousness.”
The neocortex, the gray cortex of the brain, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient year circles of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furious beasts, asks the snakes, seeks answers in the flight of the birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically – can you define it biologically?
The brain holds in its billions of connections and electrochemical connections all the memories, experiences and experiences that a person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to constantly changing presence, in an unwavering effort to try to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload disorders.
Analogically - as if you "falled" the PC, from the program of the speech emulator and translator from foreign languages, you would get caught up first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended up at the dark green bios screen, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about, I am talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You talk about it often – why are you interested in this type of regression regularly?
Because it is a hole.
In the existing functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling, and behavior, a breakthrough occurs.
Nietzsche said, “He looked into the abyss for so long that the abyss looked into him.”
A rude feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, he will mentally "die" and a new quality will enter.
Why does this matter to me personally?
I will answer by comparison.
Once upon a time one fell into a pit and drowned, days, months and years went by, he drowned and still read, and those books taught him how to swim—that is, how to live.
He became a “sinker.”
Per someone will be able to use a sentence written by me, as Hrabal's texts used to help me.
How much do you think about the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about whom nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think Arthur Rimbaud best described it in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the word and sentence formulation process."
From a young age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nema, ran along the Stínadlech in the dark streets.
Likewise, in the end, behind all the branches of the authors and their message, it sounds: "Sun bright of other worlds Karla Hynka Máchy".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
The backward reflection that comes to you through people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And even then, after years, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me that I helped them with my book in some difficult life decision.
Books are in fact “life” or, rather, “worlds.”
They are encoded in letters, carry experience, the history of the regions of the language.
We can awaken them to life whenever we let their sentences flow into their brains.
It’s actually, in a way, something forbidden divine – awakening more and more life stories, small universes, and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in lines – according to ancient demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book’s publication, you’ll be waiting for a series of authorship readings.
I remember you once loved reading.
Do you feel happy again, or do you feel differently after years?
I’d rather talk about it today.
What did I find out?
There are intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic characteristic - they are discreet, do not pay too much attention to each other, they have friendly radiation, you do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec there lived (and I hope that he still lives) a curly bookmaker (called by the name of Červenka), a cheerful friend and a good girl bull.
During one of the drinks he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Houština.
I looked them in the eyes and then they showed me a crushed, scratched copy of my book.
In embarrassment, I put off the just-readed morning table and cried shortly.
We all stood there silently, cuddling and drunk with tears.
Then the young blonde mixer couldn’t stand it and, with a scream, jumped his head out of the window into the snow.
It was on the ground floor.
We fled into the night landscape, slaughtered by the happy rage of the sensitives, the painful soul of the countrymen, and the shame of the fallen patriots – they wandered and roared like wolves until the morning.
Each book is formally and materially different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text of Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It is a story.
This is the story of a country with nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts into the mouth of the folk healer the words of one old Russian fairy tale: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There is a gray box on it.
Horror, horror and mystery.
This has never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Per we were once the devils in hell and were drawing - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to continue writing, or are you leaving it on the flow of inspiration?
The answers are eternal – Otakar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something enormous and unnamed, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our will from such depth and in such breadth that it completely transcends our horizon – and so, with the utmost obviousness, we act precisely in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die in defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes there is disruption and we radiate compassion.
Only then can we call ourselves people.
That’s the answer to your question – the biological robot is already full of various disruptions, standing on the ocean shore unconscious, and catching the tide of a wet wind into a dirt saucer made of a dirty pocket.
I have to write to be human.
Obama withdraws from healthcare
After a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday withdrew from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Referring to hundreds of thousands of reporting reports from providers, Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Last week, Obama broke his promise.
“The vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
With regard to what he called the “media turmoil” about the allegations, Obama urged Americans who received the notifications to look for new security measures in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You’ll get a better offer,” he said.
His administration says it shouldn’t be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Affordable Care Act.
“I tell these Americans frankly: you deserve something better,” Sebelius said in her testimony before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet market has gone “poorly” since October.
“I’m disappointed and angry like everyone else,” she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Irritated Sebelius said this sentence, captured by a microphone on, yesterday to the adviser sitting behind her at yesterday’s Committee meeting, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a Missouri representative, on whether she too should join Obama’s care program.
For more than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not purchase the program through HealthCare.gov, which is now imposed on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy the operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from the agencies and behind the scenes, it is said that the hand is already in the sleeve.
The announcement of the transaction is expected to arrive in November, probably before the auction of frequencies for LTE networks begins, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner’s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Sazka Telecommunications has launched a frequency auction for LTE networks.
And to the general surprise, until then there was no talk about the taste of the company to penetrate into telecommunications.
But Sazku is now led by a very experienced telecommunications lubricant Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing chief of Radiomobil (today T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobil and finally headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She submitted to the auction and now admitted that she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone.
It gives logic.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not like Vodafone under normal circumstances, but according to the information of the Economic News, this may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be a sack.
If it succeeds in the tender on LTE networks (as a newbie can auction a specially designated spectrum), Vodafone does not need to go to auction at all, or will not bother to auction only a limited spectrum (there is not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone will be able to share the network.
Vodafone will put Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respective to the newly built LTE network at the frequency of 900 MHz), allowing the company a quick start of the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building a costly LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The savings could then be spent by Vodafone for a fixed internet or cable television provider.
And the Kellner?
He would acquire the Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech) immediately a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a big mole that will be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, LTE networks would be acquired by Kellner already for O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already announced that they will share networks.
The auction could eventually end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech TV ever go without signature actions?
She entered the era of President Zeman through the legendary scene with the ashes, and so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints gathering the documents of the castle team.
In the past, the traded influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslaw Tvrdík has not been documented in this way, let alone to sign it.
It was led by the editors.
The cases described, however, do not give an answer to the question of where this inclination of some journalists to the landlords comes from – whether it is a response to a direct order, or, not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathy.
And if we assume a general rottenness, we cannot forgive the question of whether other, no less scrupulous, power interests, which have not yet been given an opportunity, are not seeking to change the circumstances in television.
Those who are right are saying that in developed countries there are no concrete attempts to interfere with politicians in broadcasting.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there are no complaints to public media.
The applicants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the product of their subculture.
Per we simply haven’t reached this civilizational stage yet, and this situation is not here.
But in a country that thinks of itself as being the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more convenient than more complicated descriptions of an unclear situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings struggles.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the verge of strength
It is almost a rule that at key times in the country the head of state was not in such a shape as to fulfill his state duties.
If Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably’t win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly beyond borders, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight there hard for its legitimacy.
And, above all, the nation would not have had a catch up from that capitulation to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman, and during Munich he was still in shape, but during the war he began to go from the hill and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
If he was a little better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It’s a pity to talk about Hach.
He said: “The president will not be able to make a decision.”
But he had to, although a big decision making with a knife on Hitler's neck in the Chancellery probably wasn't.
The chief of the intelligence, František Moravec, until the last days of March 1939 said what all should be done so that the occupation, which he knew for the day exactly, did not go through the Germans so smoothly and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, on the one hand they did not believe him, on the other hand they were afraid.
Gottwald executed his elderly comrades, as Moscow ordered him.
Ludvík Svoboda definitively made it impossible to participate in the normalization and had to dismantle him, already completely senile.
That Husák was a helpless and sick depressed old man made the events of November 89 easier, but that is the only advantage.
Havel was lucky that he hadn’t been seen in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh retired tennis player, but many of his actions suggest that the thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Now here we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces look like it, and we do not yet know everything.
Fortunately, there is no threat to the country.
It may be threatening, but it is not so.
Then the question is whether exceptionally (from a historical point of view) it is not good that the president is not entirely in power.
This is not a normal state.
Couldn't we elect in this country a president once again someone who is acceptably thinking and acceptably healthy?
Distant planets, black-and-white films or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on Earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would overtake.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6 in the grand hall of Prague Lucerna will finish this year’s Struny Autumn Festival, everything is related to everything.
Partitur of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter quartet is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
Two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber matter, and they have to think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, the newly eighty-year-old Shorter – an extraordinary composer, nine Grammy winner, former co-star Miles Davis and today probably the greatest living jazz saxophonist – does not like to explain.
He does not talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of eighty I came to the view that the best thing is to let life surprise you.
“Too many people plan everything and then they’re disappointed when things go differently,” Shorter says.
How the insects from Thailand raised the sales of the Paris bar
You may be upset about the insect and you don’t know that you eat about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For example, mixed in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is organic, nutritious and you have also taken care of a unique experience.
The insect menu was first listed in Paris on the menu of his business in early October by Elie Daviron, a chef and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
The bar, for whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, would be found in the fashionable 18th district near Montmartre, heavily visited by tourists.
With fresh avocado, baked red peppers, ginger and prepel egg, guests can bite not only different larvae, crabs or water brooks, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packed supplies (so that the insects do not damage their wings, curl their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is only learning to eat insects, elsewhere this is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pioneering menu lists several reasons to eat just insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because the production of insects is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
“In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids,” Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
“I’m not saving the world, I’m just providing a new experience,” he said.
Not everyone would be excited by the idea of how to consume a bug decorated with a fist, but the reactions of customers of the Paris bar to served insects are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics say they will end up tasting, even if they start with the smallest saucers and finally choose a scorpion.
The price of these dishes ranges from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has faced a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the lack of interest of the state in solving the problem of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will save significant amounts for heating after the implementation of the measures, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials.
Each billion invested will create more than 2,700 new jobs.
In terms of state fiscal policy, there are significant leverage and multiplication effects, it is also one of the most significant growth measures.
The Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the program, so that further challenges could be announced within its framework.
Law, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president buried and ended up in bars
President Miloš Zeman left the motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on a bed, and went to the castle in Láň.
What is his health condition?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage “has gone too far”
John Kerry hinted at a softening U.S. defense stance on its surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented confession said that in some cases espionage had “goed too far.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting like an “autopilot” in the face of the NSA’s spying disclosures, which appeared thanks to the informant Edward Snowden.
The disclosure sparked a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video link at an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that happened out of persistence, because there was the possibility, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War, and then, of course, September 11.”
He became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage crossed the border, but stressed that no-one’s rights were violated.
He said, “In some cases, it went too far.”
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is working for good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to explode themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to killing and blowing people into the air and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed, because we already know about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday said U.S. lawmakers are heading to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans that they should continue to unite forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he is concerned about their threats to stop participating in counter-terrorist organizations because they are frustrated by monitoring the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the U.S. national security interests, it is really important that Europe remains on the same ship with us, in view of joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said Murphy, a Democratic party member and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week they were inaccurate and reflect a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies have collected and shared with the United States.
Another revelation cited documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA tracked the mobile phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended allied espionage as necessary and said it was a common matter for both sides.
In the midst of the whirlwind, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, hoping that members of both parties and houses will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other lawmakers who intend to participate will be announced.
He said there is still work on the program.
Although Murphy said the aim of the trip was to help repair relationships, he added that “good-minded educational measures” would also be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs they have been using for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also be aware that we are not the only ones doing espionage here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the resentment caused by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
Australian woman appeals against staying in Thailand prison
A twenty-one-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket after falsely claiming that she was assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused on June 15 by a district court on Phuket Island of false charges when she told Thai police that the taxi driver along with two other men who allegedly detained her had assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, an industrial television recording later revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police spoke to Bamford for two days before admitting that they had invented the incident.
Before the trial, she was detained in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low guard correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in an adult female prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunkes, who sought help from the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the case of his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns” about their daughter’s fate and wanted her back to Australia.
"Obviously it's a tough time, but we hope he returns to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Australian news reports that she spent her holidays in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a court proceeding that would increase her sentence and result in placing her in adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to correct the damaged image for tourists, which may have been behind the liberating verdict.
Jake jokes: Goal from the breakout?
In the defensive zone he won a puk and no one caught him anymore.
Furthermore, the escape was transformed by a fast forhend call.
Jaromír Jágr scored against Tampere on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night the 119th winning goal in the NHL was commented on the social network Facebook.
“After watching this video, the director of the Czech Railways called on my agent Peter Svobod and asked him if I’t be interested in advertising their most modern train Pendolino!” he wrote.
I think we are very similar in type.
I’ll probably have to stop the night workouts so I don’t get faster.
“I’m afraid that the defense minister might then call and want to make a advertisement for the jet jet!” he added with a smile.
New Jersey won the second victory in a row.
“And most importantly, you’ve noticed – the treatment of Maria Rottra takes off,” concluded Jagr.
Instead of a candlestick
Instead of winners, the elections brought a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties that did not get into the House of Representatives (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of their internal split.
Instead of candlesticks, politicians served us a candlestick for the weekend.
Andrei Babiš promised voters to change the current political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party recorded the political will of Mr. President Miloš Zeman regardless of the wishes of voters, who did not even elect the party, which President Zeman publicly supported, to the parliamentary house.
The president has lost a strategic advantage over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, but he still has a few ways to get it back – for example by choosing a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD’s chances of gaining the prime chair in my eyes are getting farther away, the entrepreneur Andrey Babiš, on the contrary, is getting closer.
The election development is still a mile away from the rapid and smooth formation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the Communists, this development is a better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.
Given the loud resistance of ANO to put together with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant is still the coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).
Given the split in the ČSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak party in negotiations, the outcome of coalition negotiations can be quite frustrating for the ČSSD.
A minority government of the ČSSD composed of "non-zemanovcov" on the Castle probably won't pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to further split in the party.
So I ask myself, “Are we going to go to early elections?”
The next election would be a referendum on the power of the voting mandate of the ANO movement.
The plans of the ČSSD on introducing sectoral taxes, increasing income taxes or building a state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.
The parties of ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Dawn, on the other hand, will agree, for example, on the promotion of business, a modest fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the promotion of employment of disadvantaged persons, the reduction of the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Third areas are most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
ANO has now but on top, so the program of the most likely coalition so far ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be ticked rather to the right.
That, in my view, is ultimately a better outcome than a leftist program with taxes on everything that is still moving in the economy.
