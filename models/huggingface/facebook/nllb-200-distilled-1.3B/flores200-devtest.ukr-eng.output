This not only supports the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also reports details that could not be provided by the fossil record, such as color and three-dimensional imagery.
Scientists claim that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown above with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed stem called the rhachis, but have other features of feathers  toothed and bearded , researchers have concluded that the rhachis probably evolved much later than these other features.
The structure of the fins suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or for beauty, and researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than chicken fur.
The researchers suggested that although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen showed adult plumage rather than infant plumage.
A car bomb exploded outside the police station in the city of Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is relative to the changes in its magnetic field.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the Arrow galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth in, causing tides, so the Milky Way affects the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally not involved the use of high technology: Voters walk into the polling booth one by one and place a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope that lists their candidate.
After the official certifies the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter roll.
French electoral law is quite rigorous in its codification of procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote, and no envelopes are added except those dropped by duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following certain procedures.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are clearly taking a dangerous path by spreading photos and other data of suspected individuals".
The prosecutor's office, which is generally in charge of prosecutions, told reporters it would not comment further, at least until the indictment.
This document, according to the leak, will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants to establish based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics likely covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the maintenance of a military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
Hunters in the auxiliary pest control had to be closely monitored by rangers, as hunting was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In partnership with the NSFW and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (ASSA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at the NSPDP, the four shooters selected for the first firing operation received proper safety training and training.
Yesterday Martelli was sworn in to the new Provisional Electoral Council (TVR), which consists of nine members.
This is the fifth Martelli Provisional Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous TVC as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been provoked by the failure of elections, some of which have been delayed since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns in four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEITP) said it was aware of 27 emergencies related to these devices.
Last week, the Met Office announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "a great regret".
The earthquake occurred in Mariani at 07:19 am local time (9:19 pm Greenwich on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are reported dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographer later replaced the elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and took up a post at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the hormone injection accelerated the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, state investigators seized two airborne manifestos (black boxes).
His fellow soldiers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. The Moon died in the night of the second month. Quite unique as she is. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldast" Runnels commented: "The moon was as much a burden as I was...maybe even more...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place".
From 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
If you look at the categorical responses to the survey, 29% of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and compete in three Commonwealth Games relay events, but due to his complaints, doubts arose about his fitness.
He could not take painkillers, which are prohibited during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various gadgets and software before the beginning of February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supplies to Earth, as well as organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed, since comets have long since collided with the earth.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political baloney and nonsense".
They're suggesting he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transport is being launched and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and intercept parking will not be available on the surface.
Fears of a lack of transportation led to the idea of holding a game behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take much longer due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's jackal, Geospisa fortress, and the cactus-migrating jackal, Geospisa conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and spun, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on how acidic or basic (liquid) the chemical is.
The acidity level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions  are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by turning them in a pot, and then, with clean, wet hands, turn them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, providing a sensation that is unusual and forming something like a shell.
Toilets connected to a complex sewage network were in almost every home in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also present in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together in mixed companies.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light and what we see.
It takes a solid rocket at least 100 feet high to take a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, but the most important thing it has done for us is it has made transportation much easier and faster.
It gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey  from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (especially free-ranging domestic cats) that hunt for more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a niche  a special position that each cat occupies and that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, and they live in large groups called pride.
The pride consists of one to three adult male parents, as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behaves much like wolf packs or dogs - animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are just as dangerous to their prey.
A tiger is a versatile athlete who can jump upwards (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and punch five times as hard as a human.
Tigers are in the same group (the Panther order) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather a confused roar.
They like to eat small animals, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that the survivor hunts are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that the survivors track and track their prey by smell, looking for their scent on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and are very quiet, hunting their prey by hiding in the surroundings and then suddenly jumping on it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island and thus cannot easily return), they can often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
In this new environment, other resources and other rivals, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger rival than it was before.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all... they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, or the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans expel.
Plants prepare food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
Mosasaur was a high-order predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 razor-sharp teeth along with an extra set of them on the palate, which meant that no one who got in its way could escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe he was even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrese could not match it.
The Romans ate mostly the same foods we do, but they also had their own strange and unusual feasts, including wild boar, duck, snails, and a rodent called a wolf.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate in chairs, the wealthy men enjoyed banquets where they rested on their sides during meals.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers were built, which were part of temples and were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simple open counters that led out onto the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and travelling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even though it was discovered, the area was already inhabited by the Inuit tribes.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Nation, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even though there's actually something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
No information is known about its author, but it is known that the document (it measures 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was kept in a folded state at the beginning of its existence.
So it's quite possible that the recording was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy, who were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, and this landing was called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French Resistance had liberated southern France and were moving into Germany.
Civilization is the unique culture of a significant group of people who live and work together, that is, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "civil", which refers to the Latin word civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and this also in some way determines the size of society.
Civilized culture involves the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint, and even distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, so they are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  Congress was its sole component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because of the lack of national executive or judicial power, it relied on state agencies, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The statutes required the unanimous consent of all states before their amendment, and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful national team in the world, along with Germany, and were 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Sports such as football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and Formula 1 motorcycle racing are widely known.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipel" because of the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing past recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a branch in southwest Taiwan, beginning to transform the aboriginal grain-producing practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Wiccon Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most common still image format is 35 mm, which was the main format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm is actually a little bit of a stretch, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APIE family of formats) equal or very close to this ratio.
The often-used and derided rule of thirds  is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
According to him, the most efficient place to place the main object is the intersection of the lines that divide the grid into three-thirds vertically and horizontally (see Example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipotence affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should combat suffering and poverty, and church funds are meant to do just that.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the church really held to this postulate.
Soon after the sudden onset of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, and while the blockade violated the generally accepted norms of international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries, it cut vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain mined minerals in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant sentiments of most citizens and nations.
Realizing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations sought to prevent such a thing from happening in the future.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States to apply for a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Butcher (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were depicted in a unique way; each stage of development was a ruling family that became a prominent dynasty.
In addition, there was a volatile age of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Sanngo Period, which lasted 60 years between the Jin and Han dynasties.
During this time, fierce wars were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people killed in the battle for the throne at the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state is the property of the people rather than a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all willing men, giving the most ambitious and talented the opportunity to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of ranking by class, they now ranked by merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond this mundane life, and he often visited the cave that became known as Hira, on Mount Nur (Light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Nothing is seen but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramids built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The up button looks like a "V" and the down button looks like a bracket or square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the head and push the knob, and down means you should start at the paddle (where your hand holds the knob) and pull the knob.
The upward movement of the knob usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the knob is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to add your own markings with a pencil, but note that printed markings for stringed instruments have a certain meaning and should usually be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the marketplace drove the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, from Versailles and forced them to return to Paris.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced by the storm to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the gang waved to the frightened Queen the head of a Royal Guard soldier killed at Versailles.
The military costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay a significant portion of the costs and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Surplus profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, be the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The era when these events took place, commonly called the High Middle Ages, was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The Classical Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that actually encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or technological imperative to the idea that human destiny in a strict sense is dictated by the basic logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology as such follows a path that lies largely outside cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are rather inevitable than socially determined.
For example, someone might argue that the car necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is economically inefficient for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed that allow for a lower cost of ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road traffic accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to treat injuries.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and in time customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these, in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being an epicenter of luxury, dating from about 400 C.E. to about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, its situation deteriorated mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, that were more expensive than those on the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing of the inhabitants of the east was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of the time was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Non-commodity agriculture  agriculture whose purpose is to grow enough food to meet the needs of the owner and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds harvested from local plants of a given ecoregion in combination with seed exchange and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been organic farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be defined by age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashion items, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take a few stories of poor children who grew up in neglect, misery or willful cruelty and were not socialized by adults.
These children, called "jungle children", are often held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents leave children to fend for themselves because of their disapproval of the children's severe mental or physical disabilities.
It may be that wild children were subjected to abuse or suffered serious injuries before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some were said to be kept as animals; others were said to live in the wild alone.
An uncivilized child raised by animals behaves almost the same (within the limits of physical ability) as the appropriate caregivers, for example, treating humans with fear or indifference.
And while design technologies are supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather an aid provided to individuals who are learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is the scaffolding, like the little violin man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to query, prompt, and explain procedures that can be difficult for students to learn on their own.
Children are put in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up without care, attention, and education, but they do.
We feel that the foster care system should be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system includes safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Adoption should provide all the things that were missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to use and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as significant motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Aigma and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience response to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions  facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting the microbial expressions.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks points out that people who cannot understand language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately determine sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior could be possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research conducted in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genotypic variability: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of variations that are expressed.
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two reserves with each generation.
For primates with digestive systems like humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant resources in the savannah.
Moreover, if not, it can lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they're hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food - ants, termites, eggs - not only digests well but also provides a significant amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all of these things, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein question in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking during a normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting your clock in your sleep, it can be placed at the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking large amounts of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, causing a wakefulness to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person has is directly opposite to the level of tension in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that can stop us from reaching that goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the energy of Kundalini (energy of enlightenment) is awakened from yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deities, through which the visualization of various deities clears energy channels, activates chakras, and forms the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, leading to the beginning of the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years, and there would be real battles between armies of nations on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is certainly the most efficient means of transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods while at the same time creating barriers to your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them to make it easier to obtain milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that moved up hills and other pastures and were looked after by goats, often children or teenagers, better known as shepherds.
The dirt road was built in England in the 16th century.
And although the gauge roads were essentially two parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses working on them to develop higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly steeper conventional roads of the time.
Stepping stones were introduced to hold the rails in place early on, but it gradually became clear that the rails would be more effective if iron fixing was installed on top of them.
This became common practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known movement was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago, with Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright, as is common.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although sacheanthropes may have begun walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it's just a symptomatic treatment, but if we're not looking for a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has been dramatically changed by mankind's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have been compounded by human overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printer located a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Broadside.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap posters are now known to be the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived alongside ponies, which we call birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
Their feet have scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all the computers we use today are running on information encoded in binary numbers.
In a binary numbering system, there can be only one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and, in computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to diagnose immediately.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open can of a medication or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label for specific first aid advice for this particular poison.
Formally, entomologists describe this group of insects as beetles.
The term is a reflection of centuries of familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both bed bugs and cones are nesting insects, adapted to life in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged and younger people.
Multiple sclerosis  is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Such parents may decide to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents lose parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to learn how the world works, using scientific methods, which is actually what drives most of the research.
Although it is not just experimentation, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their functioning through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic factors, are found in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks  are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle period running freely even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment became one of the main hypotheses in the question of whether DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material, and whether the infected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells are passed on to the children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo and learning about them.
Every morning, people drive from small provincial towns to their workplaces, and they are driven by other people who work in the places they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation movement back and forth, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Now science says that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone lives in a society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about it.
You don't often hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and failures on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental?
Road flow  is the definition of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because it is impossible to predict the driver's behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave in a fairly coordinated manner; thus, traffic flows generally have some logical sequence, and may have a rough mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of transport, the relationship was established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and maintaining roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This opens up a wider range of small places for them to hide from predators.
Now the only insects that can't fold their wings are the bees and the sunflowers.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems rational, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it holds eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes as wide as six miles.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main watershed is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or technical perfection.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the construction of their predecessors, who were already well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday communication for most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in a primitive form, and extracting them with primitive tools is quite easy.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they would morph into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is usually a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also make alloys that will include non-metallic elements, like carbon in small amounts.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of these particles could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, since its appearance, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the status and use of the pencil declined.
People now type messages on a computer screen without ever having to go near the dash.
We can only guess what the keyboard will look like when they invent something new.
The atomic bomb works by taking energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy chariot up, and the fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy back.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust.
The lunar crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the high mountains.
There could be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there, so it was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been acquired by them during adulthood.
These theories cover certain people and what makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment make or don't make them do certain things.
Two popular meaning theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when managers start to manage their former colleagues. On the one hand, they try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing discipline, evaluating performance, distributing responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable personality who feels that he has to change everything that the team was doing and do it his way.
After all, the leader is solely responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact with their immediate real-world team.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet in time zones that may be misunderstood by their local supervisors.
The presence of a real "invisible collective" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual collective.
The Invisible Team is a steering group to which all members report.
Why would an organization want to go through the process of implementing an organizational learning that takes so long?
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be shown.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome barriers can lead to the emergence of a new innovation process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, and in doing so, it narrows the search area and makes it more precise.
Scientists in their studies have found a link between brain pathology and behavior.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes in ways that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has strong connotations with night fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
In AI research, machines are being forced to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer evaluations and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines focused on solving real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the armed forces, as it has been built into several applications related to home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual classroom outings, where students can look at museum artifacts or enjoy fine art while sitting in their classroom.
A virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital each year; the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online in album form.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing skills.While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
The need to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging  is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn well outside of the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to material from the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' articles, as well as outline their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital, is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and modernity.
Further south  Niagara Falls, and further north  the unparalleled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and other things highlight what outsiders see in Ontario as the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that may surprise many: The United States has more African Americans than Canada has its own citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest, and is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened a sea route around Europe's Cape of Good Hope to India.
It borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All women traveling are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a heeled hat (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what you might consider bullying, and often you're followed, you're held by the hand, and so on.
Be firm with men and be not afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it's not normal!).
The present city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, and in 1755 after an earthquake it was abandoned.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-i-Badia, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts here named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a number of trinkets, but it is all for tourists.
Goma  is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is quite safe, it is important to study the situation with the fighting still going on in North Kivu province before traveling outside.
The city also serves as a base for hiking the Nyiragongo Volcano, and for one of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla sightseeing treks.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi).
Because of this, and the relative inaccessibility, the name "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though it has an airport and is a tourist attraction with a rich history.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during PBS's reporting of Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more Arab coloration than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which hosts different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major landmarks and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily fee for security and entry.
It may also be profitable for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which entitles him to enter some of South Africa's parks or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place of special interest to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's architectural face has been compared to the glittering histogram that is manifested by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite harbor side of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed in a swampy area along the north shore.
This is a place that was taken over by the British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal strip of mangrove forests, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
These forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps, for they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water or swampy terrain.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is believed that 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer now live in the area.
Buses leave from the Inter-district Bus Station (across the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days before travel.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coster" buses, which are comfortable and durable.
The route taxi  is a quick and convenient means of traveling to nearby places such as Paro (150) and Punaka (200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a truss bridge connecting the banks of the Oiapoque River and the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guinea.
The bridge is 83 metres (275 ft) high and 378 metres (1,250 ft) long, with two car lanes each of 3.5 metres (9.8 ft) wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully opened in September 2017 when the Brazilian customs posts are completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Paiaguas, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, the Spanish conquerors clashed with indigenous groups to create Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indians".
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here and at other times of the year.
Please contact the Argentine Polo Association for news on tournaments and tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands that can exchange money is the one in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and many establishments also accept Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in remote islands, although they may take British or United States currency; check with owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to humans, the wild animals are still wild, so they do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to park guidelines, stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
As humble as they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so bring and avoid smelling lye and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour became the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, killing about 200 Americans and Germans.
During the Mau-organized independence struggle, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the Tupou supreme leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location between two harbours.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by potato trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches is located in Waitematā Bay, in the elite suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helias in Central Auckland.
These are family-owned, sometimes huge beaches with lots of shops along the coast.
The main local beer, "Number One"  is simple but pleasant and refreshing.
Many French wines can be tasted, but New Zealand or Australian wines may be better able to withstand transportation.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of flat white coffee is unfamiliar to Australians, with the short black  being espresso, cappuccino being made with bitter cream (not foam), and tea being served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are not cheap, but they're delicious.
Many trips to the reef occur year-round, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay special attention to the warning signs.
The cube jellyfish is found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
Sea crocodiles don't spend much time in the ocean, their main natural habitat being the river basins north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to stay once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often work with specific hotels, although you can try booking other accommodation with them, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages of services that include breakfast, airport transfer, or even combined airline and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your trip (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should, however, first go through the travel agent, not directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of music event attendees choose to stay overnight, and for most attendees this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be near the action, you'll have to arrive early to take a seat closer to the stage.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage has stopped playing, there may be sections at the festival that will play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, because traveling through the ice causes quite a terrible noise if you are very close to its source.
Cruises in St. Petersburg require time in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos tend to go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in good spirits and in the room.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness can affect judgment, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The road is icy and snowbound, with little friction, and no bare-ass asphalt is allowed.
During storms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get stuck in it.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blown snow or by water or ice forming on car windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to flow smoothly year-round.
Safari is perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction, drawing many visitors.
The term safari in common usage refers to a journey by land to enjoy the incredible African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, so standard equipment will give them a good look.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are fearful and are best viewed through binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "shrub walk", "descent safari", or "walking" trip) is a hike lasting several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some of the tournaments taking place at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 plane tickets and accommodation before the delay was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation procedures vary, but as of the end of March most cancellation procedures due to coronavirus have not been extended until July 2020  the time the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer a washcloth and a washboard that can be rented even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a braid or don't like wearing braided socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (which can cause it to settle or, in extreme cases, to deteriorate).
There are many different ways to treat water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it takes a minute to boil the water; in others, it takes several minutes.
If you have problems, consider getting water bottled from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals they have never heard of in their homeland.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping  is the ability to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers who travel to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most difficult stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway is the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it often passes through isolated forested heaths.
If you are not familiar with country roads, note that they are dominated by steep slopes, narrow paths, and steep curves.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, though, mobile connectivity is much better here than on many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baking is quite good, and in Bavaria quite rich and varied, similar to the baking of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is quite common: apples are used in baking all year round, and cherries and plums are used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular pies will often be especially tasty with a pot of strong coffee.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try what is called "Berliner", "Pfannkuchen", or "Krapfen" depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, curry is traditionally made with yogurt; in South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is traditionally made with curry.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the nation.
But when used without further specification, the term usually refers to food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very common throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors being peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
The  straps are the supports for the rider's saddle that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can be dangerous because of the potential for the rider's feet to get caught in them.
If the rider has fallen and his foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse may run and pull him.
First, most riders wear riding boots with uppers and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Further, some saddles, especially the English, have a safety device that causes the saddle to fall off the saddle with the belt if the falling rider pulls it.
The Cochamo Valley, with its variety of granite high rises and crests, is a major rock climbing destination in Chile, which is also known as the Yosemite of South America.
Climbing involves admiring the breathtaking views from the top, and climbers from all over the world are constantly paving new routes through the endless potential of the walls.
A popular sport involves riding a snow-covered slope on skis or snowboards that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities, which involves many amateurs, sometimes called "ski vagabonds", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings dating back to 5000 B.C.E. show skiers!
Skiing as a sport was not introduced until the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first ski resort in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called ski backpacking, ski tourism or ski walks.
This is related to, but does not usually include, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being conducted on steep slopes and requiring the use of stiffer skis and shoes.
Think of the ski route as a tourist route.
If conditions are good, you can travel significantly longer distances than walking  but you can rarely reach the speed of a ski without a heavy backpack on well-traveled routes.
Europe  is a relatively small continent but with a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean repeatedly going through visa procedures and passport control.
However, the Schengen area in this sense acts as one country.
By staying in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to get visas separately for each of the Schengen countries, which saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax agencies classify items over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies depending on geographic location  The age limit in North America, for example, may be lower than in Europe.
Craft items can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer hunting is an important source of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many who have other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami have been engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting, etc., keeping deer usually as draft animals.

Books and magazines about desert survival are common, but there is little publicity about war zones.
Tourists planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure that they have valid travel documents with them.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or documents updated with the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to consider such documents also varies widely.
The searches at checkpoints also became more serious in the era after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not had surgery should not expect to be scanned with their privacy and dignity intact.
Reverse currents are currents that are reversed from waves that break on the shore, often on a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper areas, and there can be rapid currents in deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while trying to swim backwards against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, it's not going to be any harder to swim back.
Try to head where you won't get caught in the current again, or, depending on your skills and whether you're noticed, it may be better to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.

In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a cell phone, since you need to be outdoors in clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.

Boating is a national pastime in Finland, given that one in seven to eight people travel by boat.
This is compared to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is generally quite a unique phenomenon (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most of these notable Baltic Sea cruises feature a long layover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend several full days in the historic site, returning for the night to the ship.
When you go ashore only on cruise ships, you do not need a separate visa (valid for 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

Courier companies are well paid for quick delivery of things, and often time is of the essence when it comes to delivering business documents, goods, or parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but in the case of other routes and small firms have faced a problem.
If they were airlifting, some routes would take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to do that quickly was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's your exit.
To fly first or business class, you obviously have to put up a hefty amount of money (or, better yet, get your airline to do it for you) for the privilege.
However, it is not cheap: You can usually expect to pay four times the standard fare for business class and eleven times the fare for first class!
Generally, on direct flights from A to B, there is no point in looking for a discount on business or first class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a key group of passengers who are willing to pay the ultimate price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a reasonable fee for this.
