The rookie helped Trabzonspor to second place, and the Škoda hit.
Defender Filip Novak helped Trabzonspor to the vice-master title with a goal in the final round of the Turkish football league.
His team won 2-1 at the Kayserispor Stadium and retained their third Besiktas.
Milan Škoda's striker has already scored his tenth goal for Rizespor after the January transfer from Slavonia, which was saved despite a 1:3 loss at Fenerbahce.
The rookie has confirmed his defensive performance with a seventh goal this season.
In the 63rd minute, Kayserispor's goalkeeper only fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from the corner lit the ball into the net.
The home side managed to draw five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the set-up drew the victory to their side, successfully finishing the break four to one.
The loss at the start of the second half of the match against Fenerbahce was evened after the salt to 1:1.
Although the contested position did not remain indecisive for long, it did not have to be disappointing because the results of the competition left him three points above the descent zone.
The competition will conclude with Sunday's match of the champion Basaksehir at Kasimpas Stadium.
The well-secret cave at the New Forest's Lawn Cave was not actually inhabitable.
In the north of the Czech Republic, at the foot of the Luzhian Mountains, near the Nový Bor in Českolypsko, in the forests led by the County Road, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Both natural and man-made.
And we're going to follow the man-made hand.
The place is called the Cave of the Lost.
In fact, no deserted people lived here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely, a grain storage chamber.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock arch and accessible by stairs from above.
But it's practically invisible until the last minute.
She'll be revealed by the narrow stairs leading to some rock gallery, where she's just entering the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be far from human habitation, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the upper plateau where the forest now stands.
"The fact that the object has no window and no traditional hot spring shows clearly that no deserted creature could have survived the winter here", explains historian Kamil Podroužek of the John Evangelista Purkyně Philosophical Faculty in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-story building has only a stone bench in the back, apparently used to store dishes.
"I see it as a chamber for storing food or field products", adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are visible traces of tools on the cave walls.
Braking the sandstone with a tip was fairly simple and quick for the initiates.
All you had to do was use the springs and slowly break the sandbox.
The length of the trail from the tip and the cutting method in general allow a framework for determining the period of formation of the cave.
According to historians, it's probably the late 18th century.
The cave is open to the public, and the mess that appears in it makes it a place where people sometimes sleep.
If you approach the cave from one of the forest paths and you're fascinated by the cave's flowing stream and the nearby county road, you'll definitely find the way down as well.
And on your way out of the woods, you might be caught by the nearby Raven's Rocks.
The Minaryk jockey is in a sleeping coma after a serious fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best of hands now.
The institute is set up for similar cases, and fortunately we have a family in Hanover.
This greatly eases my situation and also my care of my daughter Finju", the server Jezdci.cz quoted Minaříkov's wife Katja as saying.
"Everyone is doing their best, Philip needs time to recover.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of traumatizing the head and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient and give him time now", said the wife of a 45-year-old jockey.
The star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes on Saturday in Ascot, has also called for financial support for the injured Minarick, thus equalising the legend of Lester Piggott.
Nearly 70,000 euros have been collected from Gofundme's server to date.
The target is EUR 100 thousand (Kro 2,6 million).
The video referee took four goals from Sassuol's players, they lost 0-2.
Sassuolo's players were given four goals in the final match in Naples on Saturday, but they finally settled down with a 0-2 defeat.
None of their goals were conceded by the referee after consulting the video for the offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record-breaking technological disaster, as many attacks as VAR has ever done to a single team.
"The VAR was tougher than road radar on Sassuolo and punished him like no other team.
New technology is breaking records", the newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"The Festival of Unknown Goals of Sassuol.
Never before has the VAR been so strict on one team", the newspaper Corriere dello Sport added.
Napoli took the lead in the eighth minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
But the goal of Philippe Djuricic was not recognised after the video referee's intervention due to the offside.
For the same reason, the further intervention of Djuricic and the hits of Francesco Caputo and Domenica Berardi gradually failed.
The home side, on the other hand, added another goal.
Electric cars are setting new records.
The Czech Republic has the highest rate of inflation in history.
"The growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registration of new e-cars", said Tomáš Chmelík, head of ČEZ's clean technologies department.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, the electric car manufacturers Tesla, and the supermarkets Bill and Lidl, are also reported to be taking part in the market.
The operators of the classic petrol stations are represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our electric vehicle network only last year", explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the Denik news agency exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by ČEZ.
It follows that the drivers of the stations have taken on an average of 13,5 kWh.
That's equivalent to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
And if we don't mention the small pumps at 1 kWh, it takes an average of two and a half hours to charge.
The vast majority of the refueling was done at a free rate.
If the riders had already paid for the withdrawal, their typical loss was around 330 crowns.
Electric mobility is mainly in the capital.
The five most advanced Czech electricity generators are located in Prague, which will also be popular in the entire regional cities.
The Olomouc then leads the region.
On the contrary, the least interested are remote border stations, such as in Bohumín or Prachatic, which often remain unused all day long.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In a large-scale survey by The Czech on the Move, eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for a family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organisers, the government's actions so far on conservation and recovery of the Czech landscape and tackling the climate crisis are insufficient, and speakers called on the state to take a more transparent approach.
The Last Drop was attended by representatives of major organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace, and the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have people here, for example, who have long been protesting the expansion of the Turów mine, there are people here who are protesting the mining of gravel at the Hungarian Ostrog, there are people here who are protesting against the construction of meaningless dams", said Marika Wolf, who was the organizer.
She said the main demands of the protesters were to create a plan to retain water in the landscape, a radical change in agricultural policy and subsidy system to promote sustainable agriculture and a swift transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not the reckless and devastating business", she said.
A petition stand was set up on Malostranský Square calling on the Czech State to sit down to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore Czech landscape.
People in attendance were given banners with slogans like "End of the Ripper's Dump" or "Less coal, more boats".
Jan Škoda of the association For Water for People, which is protesting against the plan to mine gravel in Hodonínsk, has arrived in Prague from southern Moravia.
"It threatens the drinking water supply for 140,000 people", he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned quarrying site is located only about 500 metres from the wells, and estimates suggest that the water quality will be threatened.
He came from the village of Valeč in Karlovarska Vojtěch Veselý, for the so-called agro-ecological farmers.
He pointed to the pledges of small farms that do not fight for revenue and profit and supply the population directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population normally, and on top of that, they do not cause such destruction to the countryside and the environment", he said.
Three people died in a plane crash on a house in Germany
In an ultralight plane crash into a residential building in West Germany today, three people died and two others were injured.
Local rescue services have reported that two crew members and one resident of the house are believed to be among the dead.
A plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic, one of five units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy Fire Chief Robert Meyboom said both crew members of the plane were presumably killed.
The third victim, according to police, was a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) reported, referring to Mayor Wesel, that the case involved a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from her apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the crash, which was probably used as a landing brake.
The police assume that he came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before it crashed.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
The WAZ wrote, referring to other witnesses, that the plane had crashed into the air before hitting the ground.
The Czech savings bank on Saturday incorrectly charged some card payments twice.
The error has already been removed
The Czech savings bank incorrectly charged some card payments to its clients twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to bank spokesman Lukas Kropik, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The saver has already removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
The problem of double-charging card payments was reported by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday (Saturday) night we did a system update and immediately returned all these double payments to our clients.
Right now everything is working smoothly", Kropik said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank withdrew card payments twice is unknown to the bank's spokesman, who estimated that thousands of transactions were smaller.
The rescue is investigating the cause of the problem.
"It could have been a combination of several factors", said Kropik.
Czech Savings Bank is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
By the end of March, there were 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
Monday's election will introduce a three-stage coronavirus emergency response system
"They will be gradually based on the strength of community outreach at regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics", Vojtěch told the Czech Republic.
It's a so-called traffic light, and the regions will be marked in green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The Minister added that he would still be talking to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that the orange color would be presently only in the Moravian-Silesian region and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the regional level, because the situation is not uniform in them", Vojtěch said.
Aquarius and Caroline
When Aquarius Jonah and the millworker's daughter Caroline fall in love, it's not easy.
Jonah is lovingly defended by his father, the ragged waterman Hastrbuch, and Caroline has no idea that her beloved Jonah is not human.
Fortunately, there is a young Libor who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Caroline, from the water-badger.
What about conspiring and lying?
Especially if he can get Caroline to reject Jonas and give her preference to him, the mighty Libor.
Soon everyone in the village will know who was responsible for drowning the midnight Convica, the broken flour, the mill fire and other lotteries.
The villagers' fury is a pursuit of the waterman, and the unrelenting curse of the waterman falls on Jonah's head.
And now, the little soul of Convict, Caroline, please!
How do we soften old Hastrubuk, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the spell?
The story was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of ČT and in the outdoors near Lake Brzina, in Obzdenice on Sedlčansko and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovic.
Bridge car park launches new e-shop
Customers of the bridge car park can use the new e-shop on its website.
It will also buy coupons for free and test driving by car or motorcycle on a large race track, which was previously only possible in person from the car park worker in the start tower.
'We have taken steps to improve the e-shop to be user-friendly, while also expanding the product and service portfolio available through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus of 1,000 crowns for all safe driving courses on offer.
The discount coupon can be found on the website www.autodrom-most.cz", explained Jana Svobodová, Director of Commerce and Marketing of AUTODROM MOST.
The e-shop website is now transparent, and the customer can easily navigate it.
"The e-shop visitor chooses the target on the dash.
For example, sports, safe or sport driving courses, training, experience programmes, gift items, gift cards, activities for children and more", the director said.
The new products and services offered by the e-shop include a Racing Legends collection jersey with a surprise, a car slide, a reduced visibility safe ride course, advertising and gift items from the local professional racing team Buggyra Racing, or Engelmuller gloves from the limited edition of the watch manufacturer BOHEMATIC, created to celebrate the historic victory at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1949.
"The offer is very diverse, the customer can choose from more than 200 items", explained Jana Svobodova.
When paying for a product or service, the customer can choose one of four options.
Payment by deposit (bank transfer), by customs, in cash on personal withdrawal or online via a payment gateway.
Most cases are mild, with only 3 percent of those infected going to the hospital.
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of the coronavirus, or the summer sunshine dose has improved our immunity significantly.
Infection departments are half empty, even as the numbers of infected people rise.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and is mainly due to the number of hospitalized", confirms Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It's worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone was wearing shirts, the army was taking the pickup, the republic was closed, and the Czechs were consuming disinfectants a year earlier.
Yet, ten people died every day.
The daily increases in the number of infected are now higher, but a maximum of two people die from COVID-19 every day.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of people infected by population, and Jihlava has the same number of people infected by a fire at a local Alzheimer's center, where 57 people are infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another senior home has been closed by the Black Men's Health Department at the King's Castle.
The disease was confirmed by tests at one of the nurses.
"We're trashing, restricting movement, we've got all the hygiene measures", says retirement home director Martin Schanel.
He says none of the clients at the home have any symptoms of the disease yet.
They'll start testing the hygiene tomorrow and then decide on the next steps.
Hospitals are responding to the increased number of infected.
The Brno Oncology Institute today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance that detects if people are wearing a vest at the entrance.
A record number of South Chechen hygienists have reported 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of a money-making firm.
A total of 131 new cases - half of the number on Friday - were recorded on Saturday, but less testing was done on the weekend.
Debut champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a story, and Anderson was trashed.
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, also performed well in a match against the player who won the second most prestigious enterprise in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was a two-way tie, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian archer.
Van den Bergh took a break with a 13-point lead and has been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Scot" was hardly getting to the doubles.
The way the Dream Maker had him in his lap is also evidence that the dismissed Anderson played his first full season in the 24th.
Besides, the young Belgian was a great high school checkout.
Last time he lost in the 11th, he was in a bad situation but "catched a big fish" and shut down 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson was in a huge frustration.
He was more like throwing arrows and his rival, who was marching after the triumph, was acting absolutely sovereign.
Van den Bergh turned the first of three match darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable to the Belgian archer as it is his first major win.
Still, the last player to beat van den Berg was Karel Sedlak.
In Nantes, the charges were dropped for the fire at the cathedral, a man confessed
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes started to burn last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroyed the spire.
The fire suspects were investigated by investigators as a result of the fire moving through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no signs of forced entry into the cathedral.
The defendant is a local diocesan volunteer, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without a criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor's office has informed us that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed, and faces arson charges.
If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde reported.
Vojtěch: We're going to launch a semaphore on epidemiological measures on Monday
The new system is intended to serve as a pandemic plan, which faces criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health for its absence.
"They will be gradually based on the strength of community outreach", the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium orange degree.
The system is designed as regional, as the situation varies significantly between regions, he added.
The Ministry worked with the Epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) on the system.
The Minister said that specific measures would be imposed at each stage, whether it be the obligation to wear clothes or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
The Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for an epidemiological plan to be drawn up in the Prima Partie television programme, which said people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsened.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented that there was nothing serious about the situation and that it was not appropriate to talk about a state of emergency or recalling the crisis staff.
The government, in view of the growing number of infected since Saturday across the Czech Republic, has again imposed the requirement to wear a suit at internal events for more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now to 1,000 people.
The government's actions, which until the last minute were unclear on what measures, when they would come into force or when they would be announced, have been criticized.
"I think in a situation that is quite tense, the key actors should create a sense of security and balance the confusion", said Senator Marek Hilsher in Questions.
The measures may already vary by region, for example in Prague from Sunday onwards, the obligation to wear a dress is also in non-residential medical facilities, such as pharmacies or doctor's office.
The obligation to wear a dress when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies was also introduced in the Liberec and Ustek regions from Friday.
In the Highlands of Yugoslavia, dresses are required in public spaces, in the MHD and in medical facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as has the case in the Central Czech Region in Kutnogorsk.
The Czech government also approved a so-called Europe traffic light at the beginning of June, which colourfully differentiates the level of risk of infection in each European country and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from those countries.
In low- and middle-risk countries, authorities have not required Czech citizens to have a negative coronavirus test or to place quarantine on their territory since 15 June.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category.
The techno party in Benešovsk continues.
Playing at a third capacity, ending at noon
The Headlakes Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty at Headlakes Lhota in Benešovsko will continue on Sunday evening.
Still playing a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening police estimates, about 500 people remain here after 8 p.m. The original rough estimates were 300, there were 900 in the morning, police spokeswoman Lucie Novák said.
Technoparts were originally supposed to end Sunday at noon, but by that time, some of the music systems had actually gone silent.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
The music production is still in progress.
We expect that the music systems will be disconnected and dismantled gradually", Novak said.
"Police are still strictly monitoring departing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Drivers have the option to undergo a preventive breath test before departure,' she added.
Dozens of law enforcement officers are watching the event, foreign police, traffic and law enforcement are on the scene, and service dogs are also on alert.
"During today's day, police checked 470 people moving around the scene and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breath tests, six of them were driving under the influence of alcohol", Novák said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for intoxicants and psychotropic substances, one of whom tested positive.
The police also handled 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the participants of the Technoparty, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people attended the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not decreased, the police would have intervened.
This was stated by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on the Prime Party television programme.
But the number of participants dropped to less than 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not necessary, nor did the hygiene station or the health ministry request it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the techno parties had expanded to surrounding land whose owners had not agreed to use it for techno parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim damages.
The tech supporters at the head of the Hill came in Friday night.
Police were originally guarding the grounds in Blažimi, Benešovsk, where the techno party was held last Friday.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from the Head of the Mountain, where the technicians eventually settled.
Novak says no one came to Blažima.
The snake bites: The girl ended up in the hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in Iron Road.
The snake stabbed a girl, a 2010 year old, who was taken to the local emergency service base by her parents themselves", regional health emergency service spokeswoman Maria Svobodová told Denik, after which the child was taken to a hospital in Klatovech.
The snake is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in the Shumava that these animals are found in greater numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, no major danger is posed by these animals.
The chances of a snake biting you are not too high, and in normal contact, it fears itself.
And if she has room for it, she likes to sneak off for a loud squeeze.
They will attack only if they feel very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on them.
Even her stinging is not a tragedy, though her poison is highly effective against small mammals, but it does not kill humans.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weak organism or is allergic.
The risk is therefore mainly for children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"A person often feels vomiting after a sting, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur", Miriam Gred of the Klatov Hospital told The Daily.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
The policeman poured wine and threw dishes
After 11:00, the security team broke into the apartment and detained the man.
The infant was immediately taken into the care of the medical staff, said Market Janovskaya, a spokeswoman for the regional police.
The man refused to cooperate with the police, threw a dish, knife or bottle of wine out of a window after the police negotiator.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the baby in his arms.
He even climbed out the window once, where he was wrinkling.
The police are still investigating the man.
He won't release any more information.
Stosur will give her daughter priority over tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be taking part in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
The 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion who became a mother in June, but doesn't want to end her career.
She plans to return to the court next year, and she believes that her family and daughter will make her enjoy tennis even more than ever.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to Genevieve's daughter in mid-June.
"I'm staying home, spending time with my family, going to all the little milestones our Evie is going to have in the next six months and just enjoying it", the former world No. 1 in the four-man event said on the Australian Open website.
The WTA Tour will resume its March-only season on August 3 with the Pan Am Tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razie has uncovered meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises carried 1,320 pieces of unknown-origin scrambled eggs, in addition to the unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the asanas plant", the State Veterinary Administration said.
The inspection of the live fish stand then revealed that the seller had no proof of origin and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered problematic from a veterinary point of view in the long term.
For example, last fall, veterinarians discovered an illegal food sale in the area, containing nearly half a tonne of unmarked food without proof of origin.
For most, the date of consumption could not be established, some products had a past shelf life and were damaged.
For 5 kg of seed, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police detained 80 kilograms of undocumented foodstuffs at the market, including dried fish, owl or frozen ducks, some of which were mold.
Putin spoke to Zelensky on the phone before the Donbass ceasefire, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbas, where a new ceasefire is due to come into effect from midnight.
According to the Kremlin, Putin has criticized the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev has reported that he has called on Zelensky to release the detained Ukrainians.
The new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, supported by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday, be 'complete and general' and pave the way for the further provisions of the peace agreements to be fulfilled.
Putin told Zelensky that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections was contrary to the Minsk peace agreement and threatened the prospects of a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament decided last week that the upcoming local elections would not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement provides that Kiev will regain control of the Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after granting these regions wide autonomy and holding local elections.
The Zelenský Office, according to the Union Agency, said that the two states agreed on the benefits of the forthcoming ceasefire in Donbass and the need to implement further measures to promote peace in the region, such as the demining of combat areas or the withdrawal of part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea peninsula and Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement helped to stop fighting, but occasional gunfire and artillery attacks continue to kill people on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made ending the war in Donbass a priority, but there has been no major breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykle, the seven-man champion of Novotná
The defending champions of the last two titles, Dolegal, failed to reach the final of Saturday's programme for the quarter-finals, Kopecký did not jump the base in the bar on Sunday.
The decennial was long ruled by Reinis Kregers, a Latvian coach who is preparing for coach Josef Karas's group, but resigned after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside of the Czech Republic so far, this time he was the only decedent to cross the 7,000 mark.
The next medal was won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcellet and Jiří Sykora.
"It's a shame there weren't boys here and he didn't start Kope, because those results would look completely different.
But the title tastes really good, and I appreciate the fact that I've put a character in the 30 centimetres distance.
Then I was pleased with the stick and the most disappointing thing about the disc was that I was a sub-average guy", he admitted on a Facebook link.
On the first day of the seven-match bout, Catherine Cach won by more than a hundred points, despite a hamstring injury to her leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not cross the 40-meter mark with her spear, and did not advance to the final eight.
The rookie scored 5,878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
She's been out for a long time, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was around 630.
I started to feel a little bit of a lumpy yesterday, but I'm so glad I didn't feel it at all and it didn't limit me at all", Novotná said on her Facebook page.
Bio-LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its substantially lower price compared to petrol or diesel, with significantly lower excise duties, but also benefits from lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and diesel, it has its eco-friendly bio-LPG variant.
But it's quite new - it first appeared on the European market last year and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"We have received the first 15 tonnes of bio-LPG these days, which will be distributed to our gas stations in combination with classical fossil LPG", says the association of Jřík Karlík of Primagas.
However, bio-LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biofuel.
According to the association, it is chemically similar to the classic LPG that a number of motorists now tank into their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix the two versions at will.
"The only difference from traditional LPG is the way it is produced", says Ivan Indráček, president of the association.
This also gives one of the great advantages of bio-LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, for example, compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced on a targeted basis, for example from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, classical oil LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, the use of bio-LPG is 40 to 70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the use of petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
However, it is not the CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car but the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called 'well-to-tank' part (Czech 'from source to tank').
One of the largest producers of bio-LPG currently includes the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan on Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of producing at its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the association's estimates, there are about 170,000 LPG vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in the NAP ČM, about 200,000.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered car conversions were carried out in the past year alone.
LPG can be fuelled in the Czech Republic at approximately 950 stations of different operators.
The army revised the number of infected, the number dropped by 1,775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to review the number of coronavirus infections.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number of cases fell from 5,254 on Saturday afternoon to 3,479, down 1,775 from 1,254 on Sunday afternoon.
At present, there are 3422 sick people in the Czech Republic.
"The rapid increase in the number of people cured is a review of data that hygienists have not been able to update recently", said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people had been infected with the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11 419 had recovered and 371 had succumbed to Covid-19.
Mobile voting units or correspondence selection.
Political and sociological scientists have been looking for alternatives to the pandemic.
In order to allow people in quarantine due to coronavirus to vote in the October regional and senate elections, the law needs to be changed, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated manner.
He made it on Prime TV's Party Sunday.
He wants to discuss a possible solution with parliamentary representatives at the ministry on Tuesday.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law", Hamák said.
The Senate on Wednesday urged the government to find a solution within the rules of the law in force.
The minister said, however, that the provisions of the law, which prevent people in quarantine from voting due to health conditions, would need to be amended.
The prohibition on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM programme that the possibility of correspondence was already postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers the concerns of the ANO or the CFSP (since, in the experience of foreign parties, this would rather record other types of parties) about the correspondence elections to be overestimated.
I personally oppose the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that it is now necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out as early as this year and with the least possible health risk.
The main thing is to be prepared for the 2021 parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic.
He considers the choice of correspondence (whether in a foreign country or in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
They see the aforementioned constituencies as another option, or perhaps the possibility of a family representative vote.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections during the coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, various types of elections have already been postponed this year in 67 countries around the world.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig ears thrown by protesters at government buildings
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet have planted pig ears in the government building.
This was another of a series of protests against the "mafia style of government" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
The organizers are planning a nationwide lockdown Wednesday, DPA said.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th consecutive day, was less attended than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Svoboda.
By 8:00 p.m., about 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators played a theatrical scene in front of the government building, symbolically locking Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Gešev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
Resignation of both is one of the fundamental demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced healthcare reforms and an end to construction corruption on the Black Sea coast.
Protesters' organizer Nikolai Hajigenov said in a public statement that a "peak of escalation" is coming on Wednesday in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and a nationwide blockade".
He repeated the demand for Boris's resignation and his government, as well as the holding of early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has already said he has no intention of resigning.
He justified, inter alia, the need to implement the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday, he replaced five members of his government team, though the demonstration did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, the Borisov government stopped a vote of confidence in parliament.
Coach Bologna Mikhailovich doesn't want to play without an audience anymore.
Bologna's coach Siniš Mihajlovic has had enough of the Italian league games without an audience.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums after the new season.
"What we're running here right now is not football.
I've had enough of no-going matches.
It's non-sex football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
Those games are worse than practice.
Playing like this is terrible and I think I'm not the only one who thinks that", said Mikhailovich before today's game against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the matches of the A-series are in quick succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in the terrible heat.
Under these conditions, you don't even know how the teams are doing.
Just before this season is over.
These measures had to be taken to complete the competition, but I hope that fans will be back by September", said the coach, who has previously led Fiorentina and AC Milan.
For Mikhailovich, this season is unusual because he missed four months on the bench for leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the league's breakdown and everything else, our team has managed to move up the ladder.
We want to continue to grow and we need players to be mentally stronger", he said.
We've become the target of a foreign cyberattack, Iran claims
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises.
Some Iranian officials said the fire that broke out at the Natanz underground nuclear power plant this month could have been caused by cybersabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mussavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyberattacks" every day, according to Iranian media.
He added that this was not a new phenomenon and that most of them could be repelled.
In recent months, several broader cyberattacks have been reported, according to Musáví, which analysts say were carried out by "certain governments and groups".
But he did not give any details about the possible perpetrators, Reuters said.
The fire in forests, refineries and other places is common in summer, he added.
An article by Iran's state agency IRNA this month discussed that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, may have been behind recent incidents.
But none of these countries were directly blamed for the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian student militants attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
The long-standing tensions between the two countries intensified in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Kassim Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
Then on January 8, Iran fired a large number of missiles at American bases in Iraq.
The U.S. has since admitted dozens of U.S. troops were wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended the production break, now until 25 May
The Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended the production break due to the coronavirus.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday morning, 25 May.
The run will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said car company spokesman Tomáš Paroubek.
Production has been on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the strike is the closure of borders and the closure of dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroub, the company will be producing 100% from the start, that is, in two shifts.
The coronavirus has affected key markets in the company, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kaspar (Change for Cologne) said that the production break in the TPCA is not a sign of life in the city.
"It was known from the beginning, the city was empty.
But the streets are getting crowded, especially since Monday, when things have been a lot looser.
So the city is full", said Kaspar.
He says there are no complications even with foreign workers staying in the hostels.
"In those two months, we have had to solve almost no problem", said Kaspar.
For example, the Škoda Auto of the Kingdom of Jugoslavia, which also stopped production due to the coronavirus crisis, restored it on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants are running at 100 percent capacity.
The renewal of production in Skodega was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On Monday to Tuesday night, the third shift, the night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasina for the first time since production resumed.
TPCA currently employs around 2500 people and is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and employer in Cologne.
Cancer kills bride shortly after wedding: She leaves a message to family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson battled malignant cancer, and when it seemed she had defeated the cancer, the disease returned.
A 39-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a hospice bed where she still had enough to take the love of her life.
Unfortunately, the disease died.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her friend, Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for over 16 years, traveled to competitions around the world.
The 39-year-old was active in sports and healthy, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, hoping to recover.
After months of treatment, it seemed that Gemma had actually overcome her cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time to her spine.
According to the Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a 10-hour spinal surgery and then resumed drastic treatment.
But it was all for nothing.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her that she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every minute, and even arranged for her to marry her love, Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for their two-month anniversary last time.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post came up on her social media account that Gemma wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means I've finally died after weeks of too long a fight.
Though I will have a broken heart leaving my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who was by my side all along and gave me a tremendous amount of love and support during that terrible time", she wrote on social media, saying that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social media followers", she wrote, urging everyone to respect and live their lives to the fullest.
The vending machines for art sell sweat-pudding, mushroom amulets and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, a passing pocket piece is obtained by mostly beginner Czech artists.
They create images and other creations directly for the artists, so they know in advance that they must fit in at 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist in the package and then the work itself", explained project curator Petra Widżová.
Artmat is working on the principle of chance.
The buyer may be surprised at the artwork he receives.
He may now be the new owner of the fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Stoplová or the mini-scenes by Teresa Bonaventura, which can be sent.
Punx 23 artist in collaboration with Dora Dutka has created a pexeso associated with the Prague walk.
The cards must be paired with the home sign.
Ilona Polanski has created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladr and Julian Chom sell pocket-sized packages of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet made of a pregnant woman and a card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic strip Spiritist.
Health pay will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
A bigger increase is unrealistic , says Vojtěch .
Healthcare salaries could increase by as much as five percent next year, said Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in the Czech TV's Václav Moravec Questions.
He considers the demand of the trade unionists for a raise of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective assistance.
He says hospitals have their supplies now.
"I think the increase (in wages) could be somewhere in the range of five percent", the minister said.
He said the current situation, which has been taking place since March, should be reflected in the choice of coronavirus insurance pandemic and the government's anti-spread order.
Insurance revenues fell at that time.
"I think a 15 percent raise is unrealistic at the moment", Voytesch said.
The average monthly income of an acute-bedroom doctor, according to the Institute for Health Information and Statistics (IHIS), is likely to reach CZK 88,312 this year, while that of a nurse is CZK 47,498.
The difference between the salaries of nurses in state hospitals and those of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data of the UZIS also show that the decline in nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was 34 125 crowns according to the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between salaries of doctors and nurses in public hospitals, which must be managed by pay tables, and contractual salaries in city, county or private hospitals.
They also require that the pay tables for healthcare workers be uniform.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to 7,000 crowns a month.
But for doctors, for example, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unions should perceive the current situation.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to health care workers' salaries in hospitals and social services.
According to Schmuckler, the Healthcare Council does not agree to a full pay rise next year.
He said that the rewards should be decided by the hospitals and healthcare facilities themselves and that the money should go to them through a payment order.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective aids.
The head of the State-owned Reserves Administration (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in its possession.
He's waiting for the selection process to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers worldwide are now able to deliver goods better than they were in March when they were bought.
He said the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
The smart quarantine could be taken over by the military.
We're ready, they're reporting
"The strict quarantine is working, there's something to improve, of course.
We're gonna discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should not run it all again", the Prime Minister said on his Facebook show, Hello People.
According to him, IT systems and hygiene stations are not sufficiently connected and have to gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister, in the Moravian-Silesian region, where one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic is occurring.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told the Czech Republic that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
He says the army is ready for this move.
The Smart Quarantine Project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the clever quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
The project was criticized by the Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (CSSD) on Sunday.
He also thought the army might take him back.
The Commission also examined the possible possible possible possible use of the new technology to improve the quality of the services provided by the Union industry.
"The system works, but it's still being worked on.
It's been twenty years of independence and disorganization, and now we're trying to unite it in a few months.
It's not a jet.
People on the move, poor hygienists on the move, are adapting the new systems and actually picking up the mistakes", he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again because he doesn't want to "get lost in politics"
The current Mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not stand in the next municipal elections.
The reason is an attempt to "not get involved in politics", he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO presidency, has been Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, his party ANO in Ostrava won almost a third of the votes cast.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I'd last one term and with that experience in business, I could turn everything around and get it right", Respektu said.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent to run for a second term.
"But it's the best for me.
I don't want to mess with politics", added Macura, who described himself as a tough introvert who doesn't like to be in touch with people often.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation for a long time about Macur's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few figures of the ANO, he supported Zeman's candidate, Jiri Drahos, in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it's not a completely futile struggle and that no one is complaining about it, I have no immediate motive to quit", Respektu said.
The 56-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
In the case of the Commission, the Commission considers that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the Union.
He's been on the boards of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of the change in the law, Brno Transport Council Minister Petr Kratochvil (ODS) said in a press release on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as a taxi or meter.
However, the law has changed the conditions for operating both standard and alternative taxis since July.
He's been in a few meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
'On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to legally operate.
The City has been informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits set out in this Decision,' said Kratochvil.
Uber has been operating in Brno in the past.
He was protested by taxi drivers for not labeling vehicles as taxis or missing a meter.
The court has issued a preliminary injunction banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta Vanková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
Subsequent court rulings allowed Uber to drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
Now he's coming back on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July, it has been easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile applications, in addition to classic light and metered taxis.
A party too crowded in Brno: a flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of an apartment building on Saturday night in Brno and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian followed him, and immediately called the guards.
As soon as the guard arrived at the address in the western part of the city, he noticed an open window with a chair and a few cans and a set of shovels still underneath.
"The movement from the fourth-floor room suggested a rather noisy celebration inside.
Officers went out the hallway to the apartment and asked the three young men, aged between 26 and 29 years, to explain", said police spokesman Jakub Ghanem.
The request for the removal of Rafaje will be discussed by Babiš with the SSR
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday a request for the removal of the head of the Antitrust Office (AMO) Peter Rafaje.
The government's anti-corruption council and the Ustek region have called on non-profit organizations to appeal.
The Social Democrats say a change of office is in place.
According to the CCP, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term expires mid-year, and he can't be nominated a third time.
His appeal is within the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of the non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ustek region.
The reason for this is, among other things, the recent Raphael cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying he would look into the materials and that the government parties would take "some stand" on the matter.
He also said he had not yet dealt with the challenge with the president, and that he had not scheduled a meeting with him anytime soon.
According to the EESC statement, there is no reason to appeal, as Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz last week wrote that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with the heightman Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were linked to, among other things, the decision to contest the controversial new Zlín hospital project worth $8 billion, which Chunek is pushing hard.
The guy admitted to the meeting that he said they were working on his "senate activities" together.
Rafa speaks the same way.
The Ustick County prosecutor's office called on the government to recuse Rafaje at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Authority.
The EESC's decision on public procurement under Deputy Hechtmann for Transport Jaroslav Komínk is not transparent and has a bias.
Last March, the police intervened in the antitrust office over a bribe tender.
In June this year, the Aktuálně.cz server warned that Rafaj is using apartments written for the company of influential backstage player of the Czech Republic, Alexander Chuba.
But the 3.5 million deposit for the Brno apartment was paid off from Rafaj's account.
The President of the Competition Protection Office is Rafaj, appointed by the President of the former Social Democracy MP in June 2015 for a second term of office, since 9 July 2009.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year term will expire.
The Law on the Antitrust Authority provides that the President may dismiss the Chairman of the Authority on a proposal from the Government.
He may only be removed if he has not been in office for more than six months or if he has seriously infringed the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
The Blenes library was collapsing in the heat of the moment.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and be operational by the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
My three children and I go to the library in the center of Błanska regularly.
But in the warmer months, they could hardly survive.
It was very hot and bad air.
The ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm happy for air conditioning", said one of the Blenno readers, Petr Novotny.
According to the director of the library, Lukasz Dlapy, temperatures in the building often rose to over 30 degrees.
The south wall of the building is glass and works like a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun is in the building for much of the day because of the curvature.
At the same time, it is a major problem to ventilate individual departments, as the windows must be closed at night for security reasons.
We've often been in the library at 30 degrees since the morning", Dlapa said.
The worst part was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And a floor up, the exhibition room and the principal.
The uncomfortable climate was also in the children's ward, which is under the roof of the building.
"There have been several times when librarians collapsed at work and ended up in incapacity.
The problem also regularly arose in the cultural halls of the lecture halls, which are frequented by tens of thousands.
After a few minutes, there was no breathing", noted Dlapa.
The city originally wanted to air condition every room in the library this year.
In the end, it'll be three circles out of five.
"Because of limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air conditioning.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Then there is the cultural room and the children's department on the upper floor", said Jiří Svoboda of the Blenes Investment Board.
He added that in the first phase, workers had already installed air conditioning and electrical installations in the areas mentioned last autumn.
It's about 360,000 crowns.
The city library of Blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen.
The Chicago stand has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every infected athlete will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who keep their health status a secret and never reveal anything.
He was one of the few to step down from Crawford's line.
The 35-year-old Montreal native was only present at the first training session, but has since been absent from the lineup.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last 14 days locked in my house", he said.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into the full weight.
"It's great to be back.
I will do everything to get in shape as soon as possible", he added.
The veteran goalie has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goal line for the tenth straight season.
The Blackhawks are expected to face St. Louis in the preliminary, then face Edmonton in the prelims.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place, among other things, outside Netanyahu's private villa in the city of Caesarea, near his official residence, or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for weeks.
Their participants demand Netanyahu's resignation over a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also over how the government is handling the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home", one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's common nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his robe", it said on another.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister to be convicted in office.
He's charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies all the charges and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in almost 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
455 people died from the disease.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March, which helped reduce the daily increase in infections.
However, after the gradual relaxation of restrictions since the end of April, and especially since the end of June, the number of infected people has started to rise again.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not provided sufficient assistance to, for example, migrant workers affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing conflicting guidelines in the fight against coronavirus.
The driver crashed the car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut from the wreck by the firefighters.
The tragic accident happened around 11:00 p.m. near Neveklov in a narrow district leading from Slapska Dam.
The driver apparently broke into the woods at a fast pace and smashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be removed from the wreck by firefighters, including the roof.
The police are investigating the circumstances of the accident.
They ordered a court autopsy, which would, among other things, clarify whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
No more wasting and tearing up one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a major change of strategy.
He's cancelling the discounts and he doesn't want to be rattling one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of clothing are lost in incinerators and landfills every year.
The view of slow fashion, often a derogatory approach to dress, has changed quite rapidly in recent years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's merchandise sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold at a discount, they're not gonna buy.
The company doesn't want to roll up one collection after another and at the end of each season, lower the price of the product than the production price.
In addition, according to Michal Micka, the era of new and old collections and the blind follow of fast-changing fashion trends is over.
"Most merchants count on discounts when they buy goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
It's actually a bit of a scam", says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to promote local businesses with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces -- that is, clothing that is timeless and out of season.
Globally, the premium brand segment is typical of no discount, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary", adds Mička.

"The mission was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was well received by the city", said Vacek, who finished the work after 14 days of intensive work.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplices-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
But thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton, he and his brother managed to escape the concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in Britain, where he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in South Africa's Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined the war effort in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, 46, known as Camo in the street art industry, has been spraying in the heat streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas set aside for these purposes by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hurricane Hanna has reached the Texas coast.
Hurricane Hanna hit the southwest coast of Texas on Saturday afternoon (early midnight on Oct. 23).
It hit Padre Island, Texas, about 15 miles [24 km] north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened in a tropical storm as it moved overland.
However, meteorologists say that it poses a serious danger to coastal residents.
The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, have been reported, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas and recommended a voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given to people in the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the storm is expected to hit a total of nearly 500 kilometers before it gradually moves over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising sea levels, dangerous tides, and a unique tornado can pose a threat", warned the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning, local time (Monday), the storm was moving along the U.S.-Mexico border, with winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
The winds over the Gulf of Mexico were up to 145 kilometers per hour, but as it moved to the mainland, they gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, again knocking Hannah out of the hurricane category.
Local authorities urged residents to stay home and not forget about hygiene measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is one of the states in the United States that has been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the current security measures and the need to respect the detachments, possible evacuations are also a major challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take their clothes and disinfectant gels to the shelter if possible.
"We're not even close to that yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding", said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places, up to 300 millimeters of rain could fall in a matter of hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimeters, which, combined with rising sea levels, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman will lend the rank of general to Colonel Lipk.
President Miloš Zeman will be giving the rank of general to Colonel Pavl Lipk on Wednesday.
This is a summary of the Department of Defense's anticipated events.
The reason for the award of the rank of Brigadier General is Lipka's August appointment as deputy commander of the Alliance's multinational division in the North East of Poland.
Lipka is still acting as deputy commander of the Czech Army's ground forces.
The government offered Zeman a promotion at the end of June.
As of the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl Reich as Deputy Commander of the multinational North-East Division in Elblagu, Poland, which commands the Allied forces in the territories of Poland and the Baltic States.
In March, Mr Grigka became the Director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The government has proposed to the president that Lipk be promoted to brigadier general.
Under the Soldiers of Occupation Act, a higher rank may be awarded to a soldier for the duration of the exercise of a chosen function or for the duration of the service assignment required by the award of a higher rank.
The rank of deputy commander of the Allied division shall correspond to the rank of general.
A soldier who has been awarded the rank has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that corresponds to the given grade.
The loan of merit shall be extended until the reason for which it was granted is omitted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high level of professional preparedness and is a role model for his subordinates.
It is significantly involved in the implementation of the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations", the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for a promotion.
The promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, with the participation of Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar or Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
The European Union countries have agreed on common air travel hygiene standards to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by the German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer.
The agreed standards include the observance of the distance or wearing of clothing on board and at the airport, but the middle seats on board do not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these common standards", Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by the officials and that it still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and at the airport.
Sufficient fresh air must also be guaranteed on aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the requirements of air carriers.
Different standards caused confusion.
The Arctic Spitberks have a record temperature of almost 22 degrees.
"Longyearbyen has broken a 41-year-old record", the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
The temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius that evening, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About 2,000 years old, Longyearbyen is the largest city in the Spicebergs, about 1,300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Spikes are warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, says a report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies last year.
He says the average temperature in Spitberk has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could even increase by 10 degrees if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.
The rise in temperature can cause the permafrost to melt in Spicberka, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads and airports, and causing more avalanches and landslides.
Warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and sea turtles, which depend on the ocean's ice sheet.
Britons returning from Spain await a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of the spread of Covid-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but people still have to be isolated for two weeks after returning.
The new rules go into effect at midnight.
"Public health is our top priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain", the British diplomatic service said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we would immediately remove a country from the list of safe countries", she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British are worried, among other things, about being paid for their hospital care if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from holiday.
For example, Neil Hunter of Sittingbourne booked a 10-day vacation to Lanzarote, scheduled to depart on Tuesday.
They've been booking trips since December.
"We were supposed to have the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, I don't know what's going to happen after this announcement.
I work as a machinist and I don't think my employer will accept that I'll be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation", Metro Hunter quoted the newspaper as saying.
There are concerns that Spain is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been over 900 new cases in every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from gathering in large crowds.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has again warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The government is discussing a model for the purchase of electricity from Dukovan
The government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovan nuclear power plant on Monday.
The bill is expected that if the purchase price is higher than the market price of electricity, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously said that the most likely option is that people will save electricity through construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as has been shown several times in the past.
The intention has been criticized by environmental organizations before.
"The purchase price may be below or above the market price of electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the insurer - at lower consumption or at higher consumption of electricity', the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the material footnotes.
In May, Hawlikek said he expects wholesale electricity prices to rise and people at Dukovan's construction to make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact would be tens of crowns a year per family, which he says is far less than people pay in electricity bills each year to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the ransom price could be between EUR 50 and EUR 60 (about CZK 1320 to 1600) per megawatth hour (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any draft amount, it must be contained only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is now the most sought-after by traders, is currently around EUR 45 (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
'With a difference in the purchase price and market price of EUR 10 for electricity, the surcharge for an average household with an annual consumption of 3,3 MWh could be equivalent to four households with standard electrical appliances, including electric boilers and ovens, but without electricity for heating and hot water heating - less than CZK 100 per year,' the MPO government sub-clause said.
"We live in a time of great turmoil.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a highly speculative matter,' said Tomáš Voltr, formerly CEO of the investment group Energy financial group.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be made by the MPO, or by a legal entity authorised by it, owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The investor-state contract guaranteeing the terms of the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, including repeated but not until the end of the low-carbon production operation.
The low-carbon generation proposal defines a nuclear reactor power plant connected to the electricity grid with an installed capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) of minimum electricity after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovansk block would have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The government approved the funding model for the new Duquesne block on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the State without any cost, with an interest rate of 2% for its operation.
The opposition disagrees with the funding model, and it also dislikes the possibility of the Dukovans building Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should be 70 percent involved in the construction.
The remainder should be paid by ČEZ, which will also bear any additional costs.
In May, CEZ Director General Daniel Beneš said that the expected amount for building the block at current prices is about six billion euros (about 162 billion crowns).
The treaties between the state and the Czech Republic on the construction of the new Duchy block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development downloaded two billion dollars worth of media tourism support material
The Ministry of Local Development (MMR) has withdrawn from the comments procedure the material according to which it planned to spend 2 billion kroner on media, internet and billboards for holiday advertising in the Czech Republic.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) of the SeznamZprávy.cz server said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in the eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) was alerted on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry of Tourism has justified the plan for the decline in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media and the public have seen declines in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and tourism officials.
According to the proposal, which is now available on hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money through the state tourism promotion agency CzechTourism for advertising on television, broadcasting, print, the Internet, billboards or station platforms.
The largest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to the TV.
Most of it would be bought by private TVs Nova and Prima.
The printed newspapers and weeklies would get 400 million, and the same amount would be given to the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Broadcasters would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of it back to private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and parking lots at stations and subways.
The Czech tourism promotion campaign was to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not in the form it should be presented", Dostal said without further details from the News List server.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Marketa Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andreja Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe this spectacular contempt will get a shot in the face in the election fall", she tweeted.
Dostalova denies that it is actually aid to the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support", she told The New York Times on Friday.
She says the budget of two billion is indicative.
"We're still counting, of course, it could be less or more.
It's work material", she added.
The Save Tourism Initiative does not make sense of a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not a wasteful advertising campaign", said Tomáš Barčík, president of the initiative, on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The fountain of life, the cock of beer, and death like a stalk of grass
Posthumous is also the third album, entitled A death is the straw of the brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fritz, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Fritz's discography, it is the fifth item and like the previous titles, here too the main emphasis is on Fritz's poetry, of which he is himself an excellent interpreter.
Fritz, 1949, was naturally influenced by the American beat generation, but he drew inspiration from his own, specifically presented experiences and also from deeply felt expressions of faith.
But he was far from any agitation, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I think in this context Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Gardnishek, for example), the masters will forgive.
The album features recordings of authorship readings from 2006, but also performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensibly, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Barton and Vítězslav Holata.
I'd like to help with the words of the Ostrov poet Peter Hruska about Fritz's long poetic compositions.
"She sent from them a proud and endless bitterness", writes the Horn, "to the condition of our world threatened with extinction.
The world, which is falling more and more into the dull consumerism of vanity and greed, is increasingly moving away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility, and human closeness.
It was a lack of those who knew that the values for which they were created were of little interest to them, but who also knew that they could not be abandoned simply because of general disinterest.
The poems reminded us that one may have to lose everything dear, but it is not insignificant how one loses it.
If he surrenders to general decline, resigns skeptically, silences fearfully, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud persistence in what he believes and loves".
The wig is not my advisor, said the Hammer
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the CSSR, Jiří Paroubek, is not a paid advisor to Social Democracy.
The party chairman and interior minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
That's what the hammerman said on the Prime Party TV show today.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz informed him on Friday that Paroubek should be Hamák's advisor.
"We write a letter from time to time, he sends me some material and I read it", Hamák said today.
It added, however, that this was not an official and paid cooperation.
The SSC claims that it has no means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I read his opinion from time to time, there are many such people", he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "unconditionally listen to the views of Václav Klaus".
He thinks it's okay because he's an experienced politician and a former party chairman, which is the case with Paroub.
The fact that the media is making an affair of it marked the turmeric season this year.
The SeznamZprávy.cz server on Friday wrote that Paroubek is acting as Hamak's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the party's candidate in the Province of Ustick was running for fourth place, with former president of the local cell Petr Bend, who is affiliated with Paroubek and served as deputy chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamak today said the candidate's lineup won't comment until it's done and approved.
Duplantis has a mile ahead, he's a kick in the ass, a Swedish challenger is barking
The 22-year-old American barman has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious contenders for the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat two years younger Duplantis, defeating him at the NCAA University Conference last year.
"We had a fight a year before, he won it and I was second, then we threw it away.
In both cases, it was a very good fight", describes Nilsen, who won the race by a distance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since fired a sharp shot upwards and is now alone in the highest bar spheres.
At just 20 years old, he set a world record, crossing the 6.17-meter mark in Torun on February 8 this year, and adding an inch a week later in Glasgow.
"He jumped six feet at the age of 18 when he graduated from high school", recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from a boy to a man, his potential and talent would be tenfold increased.
Twenty years is a good age to break the world record", he believes.
Being on Nilsen's list of accomplishments is more about knowing than the one Duplantis is proud of, an American setting similar goals.
He has hitherto pointed to his options at the NCAA Championships, which he regularly won, in February this year he improved his personal best to 5.93 m at one of them. Last August he won the gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, and in 2017 he fought for the US World Championship, where he finished 13th.
The closest thing to a lover is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because you can make a name for yourself there", he admits.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same thing at events like the Olympics, the World Championships or the Pan American Games".
But because of the pandemic, these high-profile holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and other stallions time to improve.
But will that be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a five-lap race into a simple silver-growing fight?
"Everybody is trying to catch up, but I don't think it's going to be possible anytime soon", Nilsen reflects.
"This boy has been jumping for 16 years and he's a mile ahead of everyone else in training".
And before Tokyo starts 2021, he'll want to raise it even more.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands on her disabled son's pension.
She's going to court.
The money a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
A woman could face up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Because of his poor health, the court relieved the sick man of his lawlessness and appointed his mother as a guardian, who would manage his son's money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, the woman used some of her son's disability pension funds for her own needs, and prepared him for 440 thousand crowns", police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said, complaining that the accused woman had a special duty as a guardian to defend the interests of the injured.
The woman, on the court's orders, set up an account for her son, but he sent his pension to her account.
"After paying for the costs of her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to buy a car, electrical appliances and a household", the indictment says.
That he can't use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for family expenses.
"We had trouble with our income dragging the household's way.
We never bought anything out of the ordinary.
It was always about things that my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime", the woman explained to the police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after discovering tools
The finds of the Chiquihuite Cave in Zacatecas, Mexico, include 1930 calcium tools, including a fine blade that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spearheads or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the instruments date back to 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here", said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of Zacatecas State University and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach 12,500 years of age.
According to experts, the people of the Chiquihuite Cave, located at high altitude, have lived for 20,000 years.
The most widely accepted theory to date has been that the first Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this human culture subsequently spread to much of North America.
But this model was ripped apart in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
A second study published in the journal Nature reports on 42 different sites throughout North America that prove a human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them could have gotten to America by ship.
"It is clear that humans were present in the Americas long before the development of so-called human culture", said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, about the new findings.
Interest in tickets has so far been a positive scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are also falling gradually
Airline ticket sales in the Czech Republic are increasing every week.
Interest is still about half as high as last summer, but demand is growing by as much as 20 percent each week.
The developments after the crisis, according to the vendors, fulfil the most optimistic scenarios.
Airfare prices are also falling.
According to the sellers, the most sought-after destinations are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are the leaders.
The best selling flights to the Croatian Split are on the Letuška.cz portal.
The most sought-after destination among other countries is the United Kingdom, which has always been one of the most sought-after destinations.
The average price of air tickets is also falling.
At Letuška.cz, around 6250 crowns were moved at the half-moon, a yearly decrease of 3000 crowns.
This is mainly due to the increased demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85% of sales.
However, prices themselves have fallen by about a fifth in some European countries, such as Spain or Italy, in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, fearing further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time for purchasing a pre-flight ticket has been reduced by about 10 days annually.
"This confirms the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, require more flexibility, take less risk", said Michal Šindelář, vice president of products for Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average time of booking before departure is 21 days.
The number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing with the increase in sales.
The Prague airport currently operates regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
This is about half the destinations compared to last summer.
The grand final is tonight!
Watch the archery battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the PDC's history has advanced to the grand final.
It features the veteran 49-year-old Scottish archer Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor on the boardwalk.
But he also took James Wade on board, and in the quarterfinals he faced off against Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world No. 1.
"Flying Scots" had a hard time in the semi-finals, facing Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he ran from the shovel to the tomb, dominating the extension and after 18:16 he secured a place in the final of the tournament, which he had already dominated in 2018, when he defeated Mensura Suljović 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him play on a fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old archer first surprisingly knocked out Nathan Aspinall, then Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and then knocked out Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals.
The semi-final was a big check.
Glen Durrant showed his strength from the start, but the calm Belgian then won the excellent series, which he then kept almost without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, exposing the occasional uncertainty of the double.
Coronavirus cases have increased since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been confirmed infected with it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already recovered, 368 patients have died.
Currently, there are 5,254 people who are sick.
That's according to the data on the Health Ministry website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has quadrupled to over 200 cases.
Friday's maximum was 281.
On Thursday, 235 tested positive, the day before 246, and on Tuesday, 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 new cases were reported.
9,590 people have already been cured of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most of them had a mild course.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavirus are in the hospital, 19 of whom are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The highest number of cases in the last seven days, per 100,000 inhabitants, is still reported in Karvinska, almost 59.
This is followed by Jihlava district with 56 and Frydek-Mistecko district with 36 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
New measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus are in place in the Czech Republic from Saturday due to the increased number of infected.
People have to wear dresses at indoor mass events over 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be cut in half from the current 1,000 people.
The number of people who have already been proven infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million worldwide.
This was reported by Johns Hopkins University, which tracks the global pandemic.
The death toll from COVID-19 is close to 645,000, according to this source.
The latest one million cases have been added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which has more than 4.1 million cases, has been the biggest contributor to the rapid growth in recent days, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where officials say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
The number of infected is now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases have been reported worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily figure since the pandemic began.
This is due to the fact that the prevalence of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the United States, Brazil and India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases has increased in the past week in nearly 40 countries around the world.
This includes Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Israel.
The infection has already appeared in almost every country in the world, with the first case officially reported today by the DPRK.
The air in the houses is up to five times worse than the outside.
Health Is Harmed by Air fresheners and Deodorants
Not only is poor air quality in outdoor areas but also at home a health risk.
This was noted by Israeli public health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped to create Israel's Ministry of Environment, the focus on pollutants in homes should be on the present day, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned a study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that found that indoor air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year from poor air quality in their homes.
"Due to the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and still forces people to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on air quality in homes", said Abraham.
In Israel, she says, almost no one cares about the quality of "home air".
However, things that people commonly come into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"The exhaust gas is also produced by the clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners", said Abraham.
She said children, elderly family members, and people with breathing problems are most at risk.
Otherwise, healthy individuals may also begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, nausea, irritation of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances may damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
But not all pollutants come from objects inside homes, and the materials that make up the houses can be a source.
Vaclav Havel's quiz: How long he was in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada has been stripped of the chance to advance to the top flight of Spanish football due to the coronavirus infection.
The competition was cancelled by the management of the original postponed final round of the second league, in which the team could secure a play-off.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more cases on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive Covid-19 tests at the club to 28.
Due to the team's infection, Monday's match against La Coruna was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had enough points to make the playoffs.
The competition's board said today that the duel against La Coruna was definitely cancelled due to the higher power because it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada has made a decision.
Against the non-playing match, the storm of La Coruña.

Karl Gott did not like the Václav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter revealed it.
"My dad didn't have him for many years", she told Ah! the eldest daughter of Gotta Dominic, saying that Master could not come up with a name for Havel and that whenever he had a word for it, it always upset Karl.
It's hard to say what they did, but Dominic says the dispute started sometime in the mid-1990s.
"In an article after the revolution, Dad said that it was easier than he was.
That Havel could write in a drawer in the dark, but if he resisted, his career would be over", says Gott.
But later he adds that the Czech giants finally found their way.
"I know Havel could not hear the word at all until he was 60.
Then the president congratulated him on his birthday, and suddenly his relationship with him began to change", Dominic recalls.
Ten years later, Gott even invited the then-president to his 70th birthday party at the Ambassador Hotel in Václav Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because my father regularly invited Mr. Havel home to his home in Bertramck", added the blonde, whose father died last October.
The celebrity was also said to be sorry that he never received a state award from Vaclav Havel.
However, he was only appointed in 2009, although this was already in the hands of his successor as Václav Klaus (79).
Further honours will be awarded in memoriam, as the current President Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion to honour his memory.
