This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the animal's wings were brown above with a light or carrot color underneath.
The find also provides information on the evolution of the wing in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed axis called a spine, but do have other features of the feathers, researchers concluded that the spine was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or demonstration. Scientists contend that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick feathers.
The researchers claim that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample suggests adult plumage, not a newborn.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

The part of the work completed was mainly theoretical, however the program was designed to reproduce observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
What the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and its Milky Way counterpart.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, creating tides, so the Milky Way pulls on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter found in a galaxy is trapped around the galaxy, forming a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, elections have always been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a canopy and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper listing the candidate of their choice.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, he throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter roll.

Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process, and in the late afternoon, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision who follow specific procedures.

Police Director Chandra Sekar Solanki said the accused appeared in court wearing face coverings.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road to the accident was temporarily closed as emergency services were pulling the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then went to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeccoia has since been charged by the High Court in Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
She's in custody with charges and a trial pending, but any alleged eyewitness may have been affected as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but justice in Scotland operates differently and courts have ruled that posting photos is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee reports that journalists seem to be in a tight line if they publish photos etc. of suspects.
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed reporters that there will be no further comment at least until charges are filed.
According to the leaked information, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other issues reportedly covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy site for both states, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional test pest control would be under close supervision by the rangers as the test was checked and its effectiveness judged.
In cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Australian Shooting Federation (NSW), special volunteers were recruited as part of the Shooting Federation's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director General of Parks Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four snipers selected for the first hunt were given detailed safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelli was sworn in to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council.
This is the fifth temporary election of Martelli in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed the previous resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-opposition demonstrations that began in October.
Some brutal protests have been due to the non-election, some pending since 2011.
According to official reports, there were about 60 iPod malfunctions that resulted in high temperatures, starting six fires and leaving four people with minor injuries from the fire.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling it "really regrettable" that Apple's report was postponed.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time.
The Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino ex-police officer took Hong Kong visitors hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, his country's capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six of the hostages, along with children and the elderly, were released early; so were the photographers who came from the Philippines.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
She qualified and became a gynaecologist, starting work in 1959 at the Government Gynecological Clinic, Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins, in his spare time, began to research preterm birth.
According to his research, if a hormone was given, the embryonic lung would mature.
Xinhua said government investigators on Wednesday spotted two black box flight data recorders.
The fellow fighters paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first winner of the Queen of Extreme competition, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons, unique as she was, a powerful woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I miss her... and I hope she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a democracy have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a sovereign democracy when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agreed with this idea because they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
On both ends of the poll, 29% of all respondents believe that Australia should become a democracy without a monarchy as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a democracy without a monarchy.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three dog sled races at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition is being questioned due to his discomfort.
He couldn't get the medication he needed to stop the pain because it's banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest prime number ever found.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water transport to earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Civil Aviation Administration claims that the next-generation air transportation system would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite-based as opposed to the older ground-based technology that relies on radar to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate an aircraft and give more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transportation will be made and the underground railways will not stop at Wembley.
Fears of a lack of transportation raise the possibility that the match will be forced to be held behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in Science spoke of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process is thought to have taken much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's spider of the genus Geospiza fortes and the migratory spider of the genus Geospiza contrisiros.
Gold can be carved into any shape, it can be shaped into any size.
It can be forged into a fine wire, then bent and knitted, forged or wrapped in sheets.
It can become so thin that it was sometimes used as a decoration on handmade book illustrations called illustrated manuscripts.
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that no longer have their electrons (as a hydrogen atom is made up of a proton and an electron).
Turn the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in your palms will react with the outer covering, which will create a strange sensation and create something like a peel.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet with a boiler for each household, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Also in Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, ruins of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets in Rome were often part of public baths, where everyone regardless of gender formed a mixed crowd.
When you call someone who's far away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back to earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by rocket, and the experts have space telescopes because our planet's atmosphere causes distortions in our light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The contribution of the wheel to the world is amazing, but most important of all, it is the simplest and fastest way to move.
Thanks to him we have trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are many predatory kittens (including free-roaming domestic cats) that prey on the many bugs, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the idea of position, a special role for each cat, which prevents competition between them.
Lions are the most social of the feline species, living in crowded groups called herds.
Flocks consist of one to three adult males mating with each other, together with up to 30 females and their young.
Females usually have a close bond with each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act much like wolf packs or dogs, animals that look remarkably like lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely lethal to their prey.
The tiger, as a complete athlete, can climb (at a not-so-good level), swim, make huge jumps, and use five times more force than a strong man to lift something.
The tiger is in the same class (Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but it is more like a phrase than angry, loud words.
The oselotes prefer small animals, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and even birds, almost all the animals that the oselotes hunt are smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that oselotes follow and find prey by scent, smelling the ground to see where they are.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move quietly, and they hunt their prey by adapting to their environment and then by attacking their prey suddenly.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often encounter a different environment than in the past.
This new environment has new sources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was required in the past.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, they need to make the same adjustments as in the past.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the similarity to the rest of the population diminishes.
At some point, after thousands or maybe millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be considered the same species.
This process is called "eudogeny", which means the formation of new species, and eudogeny is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., expel by breathing).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
Our homes and our clothes are made of plants, the food we eat is mostly plant-based, and without plants, animal survival would be impossible.
Mosasaur was the leading predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anything but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth combined with an extra row of teeth at the tip of its mouth, suggesting that there was no way out for anything in its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a flared tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other dinosaurs, and he may have been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that entered the water, and even the giant dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus, would not have been a match for it.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans also had various strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a glider.
Another difference is that the poor and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, while the rich men preferred to eat at banquets where they could relax on their side while eating.
Meals in ancient Rome could not contain foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, there was no corn, tomato, potato, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
The people would sacrifice to the deities, and the priesthood would attempt to fulfill the deities' desires by organizing rituals and celebrations.
In each temple there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests have access.
Sometimes concrete pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the roof was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of their lives in the countryside.
Women cooked in the courtyard while shops were open benches facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forested areas, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse saga, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he found Greenland and named it that way.
However, despite its discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie "Finding Lost Treasure", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is some kind of treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was written as follows: "Original Declaration of Independence issued on July 4, 1776". This is written below, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for storage.
Therefore, the footnote may have been added merely as a label.
The Normandy landings and the fighting that followed liberated the French North, but the South was still not free.
It was run by the Vichy government, which was made up of Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this raid was called Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and Germany was next.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this actually describes in some way the size of society.
Cities-states are the ancestors of states. A cultural culture involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, in a continuous cultural footprint and a great dissemination.
Often, smaller civilizations are lost without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as normal civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government - with Congress being the sole component - based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no taxing power, and because it had no executive or judicial power, it relied on uncooperative state authorities to enforce all laws.
Moreover, it had no jurisdiction to override the laws on taxation and customs between the States.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so defiantly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams in the world and were even the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Nordic countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and in Olympic Games events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island on the planet!
Because of the island group Japan has, the latter is often referred to as an archipelago, from a geographical point of view.
The beginning of Taiwan is lost to the past, in the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began a transformation in the practices by which indigenous grains were produced, employing Chinese workers on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated western and northern Taiwan, which they made an administrative region of their empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1985), the Qing Dynasty then concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby Taiwan passed into Japanese hands until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Idiwatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch in order to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common form of still photography is 35 mm worldwide, which was the most prevalent film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly is the aspect ratio that has been inherited from the digital camera's image sensor shapes.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide, which is confusing, and 24mm high.
The ratio of dimensions of this arrangement (divided by twelve to arrive at the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format category, for example) are equal to or close to these aspect ratios.
The law of three, often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates momentum while maintaining order up to a meter in an image.
It states that the most effective point for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, now rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has forged unbreakable bonds among European nations despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from kings to mere mortals.
One of Christianity's main beliefs is that wealth should be used to relieve the poor and suffering, and church funds are raised specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to wonder whether the doctrine was being properly implemented.
Britain began to blockade Germany from the sea immediately after the attacks began.
The strategy was effective in cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has planted mines in international waters to prevent ships from moving anywhere on the sea, threatening even neutral ships.
As there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected the same for unimpeded submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was peace and isolation.
The nations, having seen the horror and brutality of war during World War I, wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of differentiating each distinct time period. Each stage of China or each ruling family was also a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those times there was a fierce war between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences are many and include the use of the metric system, a shift from authoritarianism to democracy, patriotism and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to the whole people.
Also, after the Revolution, occupations were open to all men seeking work, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the army, as instead of being ranked by category, it was now ranked by size.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people of the working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was intensely interested in matters beyond this mundane life, often visiting a cave that became known as Khira on Mount Nur (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, where it survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave is isolated from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not at all easy for someone to find it even if they know it exists.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky and the many mountains around it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Death Valley of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the largest of which is the pyramid of Khufu), a few small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, as well as the smaller tombs and temples, were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The upward-moving sign of the bow resembles a V, and the downward-moving sign resembles a clutch wire or a square without a bottom.
Playing up means you have to start from the edge, pushing the arrow, and playing down means you have to start from the frog (the point where your hand holds the arrow) and pull it.
Playing the bow upwards produces a softer sound, while playing downwards is louder and more dynamic.
You are free to put your own notes, but keep in mind that the ones that exist perform some musical function, so they often need to be considered.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, who had been terrified, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd began shaking the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles, before the eyes of the terrified queen.
The costs of the United States' imperialist war to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were required to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs, and the bond rate was encouraged on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the surpluses that resulted from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were to be the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when the events occurred is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1,000-1,300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological justification is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or imposition of technology, to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly linked to scientific laws and their expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely away from cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn exerts influence on societies of an intrinsic character, rather than on societies adapted to today.
For example, one might argue that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership regime also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in health care for repairing physical injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, coming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and over time customs and cultural elements related to this geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the position of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is considered the source of style in the modern era, so Constantinople the corresponding European source during the feudalism.
Its reputation as a center of abundance began to spread around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its prestige declined in the twelfth century, largely because of the Crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which were of higher value than the products of the Byzantine markets.
That was when the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Istanbul to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.
Initially the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, slow communication channels meant 25 to 30 years of delay in technology in the West.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time, which came about as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to fasten their clothes with buttons.
Maintenance farming is farming that takes place to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Survival farming is a simple, usually biological system of using stored seeds sourced from the ecosystem of the area, combined with crop rotations or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Traditionally, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel marginalized by social norms, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided by age, origin, social class, location and/or race.
The qualities that make a subculture distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
To mark their identity, members of a subculture often adopt a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, behaviors, and slang.
A key technique for the meaning of socialization is to rely on the minimal unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, bad luck or abuse, were not associated with adults during their lifetime.
Some wild children have been isolated by humans, usually by their parents themselves, in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the rejection by the parents due to the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or before fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are supposed to have lived alone in the wild.
A feral child, when raised entirely by animals without contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that are almost identical to those of the particular animal that cared for it, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, aids go one step further.
Increments are not a way of learning but rather a helping hand to people who are undergoing a new teaching experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real-world incarnations, in other words, the teacher is a form of incarnation but the same goes for the little human connector in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are integrated into the software and are intended to ask, promote and explain processes that may have been very difficult for students to handle.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without care, love and education, but it does.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
The foster care system we have is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and affordable health care.
Adoption is supposed to provide all the needs that the child did not receive in the home from which he was taken.
The Internet contains elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet result in additional dimensions in the approach of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socializing are considered important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' were also identified as drivers by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in researching audience reactions to websites.
Video has helped us to make important discoveries in understanding our tiny expressions, our expressions that last infinitesimally.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his dissertation entitled The President's Speech, states that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to distinguish honesty accurately.
It is further thought that these abilities to understand human behavior are present in animals such as domestic dogs.
A 20th-century study showed that there are two forms of genetic diversity, latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variants and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variants.
The distinction and blending redistributes the diversity between the two sides in each family.
Out in the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its need for amino acids from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so had serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins that can bind to leaves and pollen, but are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only digestible but also an important source of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all the evidence, it's not surprising that our ancestors faced the protein problem the way chimps do on the savannah right now.
Interrupted sleep is the process of consciously waking up during the normal period of your sleep and falling back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet wake-up clock so that you regain consciousness without being fully awake.
If you catch yourself turning off the alarm clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you need to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties) before bedtime to force a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less pressure, the better the life force that is present.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only obstacles standing in the way of that goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded from the path of love of the Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, in principle, is very simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is awakened through movement, inhalation and exhalation practices, mantra and visualization.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. By the end of the war, conflicts at the systemic, process and cultural levels had led to the two countries' breakup.
As two years had passed since the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and have war games by delegates, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defences had already broken down, and their only hope was to retreat and regroup on the Romanian outpost.
However, these plans ceased to be of benefit within almost one night when more than 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large parts of the population and goods overseas.
The work of the Marines has long been to ensure that your country can move your people and your goods while at the same time preventing your enemy from moving theirs and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly submarines, was attempting to cut off this traffic.
If the Allies failed, the Germans could probably take Britain as they did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes are starting to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often cared for by goatherds, usually children or teenagers, who were the equivalent of the more widely known herders.
Log rails were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails were made up of only parallel wooden planks, these allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the less rough roads of the day.
Wooden railway links appeared quite early and were intended to hold the railway tracks in place, but gradually it became apparent that the tracks would be much more functional with an iron support on top.
This was a common method, but the iron created more clogging on the wheels of the wooden carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron railway lines appeared.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning standing man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is usual.
Evidence of bipedal movement has been found in Australian primate fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahel man may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We have the opportunity to live a more sustainable life, to join the environmental movement, and maybe to be activists to somehow limit the problems of the future.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases, but in case we don't want a temporary treatment, we're going to have to find the source of the problems and inactivate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological achievements, and that the problems have been aggravated by overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles.
After its approval by Congress on July 4, the handwritten note signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night 150 to 200 copies were published, more commonly known as Dunlap's pamphlets.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the outdoor area of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that we know of are still in existence, and they are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that a species of dinosaur survived to the present day.
They don't see them in the dinosaur category, quite a few because they have wings and they have the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with claws and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like T. rex.
Computers now rely on the management of information encoded in a binary system.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can take only one or two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are so general that an immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The most obvious sign of someone being poisoned internally is an open medicine bottle or some toxic household chemical in the room.
Read the label for special first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term koreos is officially used by etymologists for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient acquaintance with insects, which were easily adapted to parasitize humans.
The killer insect and the worm are nest-dwelling, adapted to live in the nest or shell of their host.
In the United States, about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
Two couples may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child they have.
These couples can plan an adoption for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The basic goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which is essentially what drives most scientific research.
There is more to experimentation than that, and specifically, experiment is a test conducted to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
Physicists and philosophers focused on classical texts and specifically on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek intellect lost ground, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noted that often the rhythms of physiology and behavior depend on the existence of internal cycles and their production by means of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The body clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps on cycling even when no external stimuli are present.
The Hersey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
The Hersey and Chase took phages, or microbes, to put their genetic material into a bacterium.
They did two experiments in which they either marked the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may produce a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the role of the part of the genetic material it affects, and whether the affected cells are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cell lineages can be inherited to offspring, as mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who seek natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the area's wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in a given location are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information concerning the ecosystem.
For example, some visit, photograph, and learn about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and meet others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In dynamic shuttle transport everyone is connected to each other in some way and support a transport system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this huge carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of a steady state that has supported the evolution of the human species over the past two million years.
Every individual participates in society and uses some form of transportation system, and almost everyone expresses complaints about transportation systems.
In developed countries complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard at the same level.
Why do transportation systems bring such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more substantial to blame?
Traffic flow is the analysis of traffic of particular drivers and cars between two places and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not easy, as it is impossible to predict with complete certainty the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consistency; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
In order to better represent traffic intensity, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships helped to prepare, design and operate the road network facilities.
The first animals to take off were insects, whose ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body backwards.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hiding places than predators.
Now the only insects that can't fold their wings are the dragonflies and the newspaperflies.
Many years ago, Aristarchus reported that the solar system revolved around the perimeter of the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought otherwise, that is, that the solar system revolved around the earth and the sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles.
Twenty percent of the water that the world's rivers discharge into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, gathering water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the Giza pyramids in size and technical excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also used in everyday life by most people working for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Man has known of the existence of such basic chemical elements as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in raw form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is created by mixing one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
It mostly looked like the four forms of matter (in this order): solids, liquids, air, and plasma, although he also assumed that they changed into new substances to form this presence.
Remember, there are many chemical elements on the periodic table.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of very small particles, atoms.
The size of atoms is so extremely small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have appeared, the place and usefulness of the pencil has declined.
People now text on computer screens without ever having to hold a scissors.
One may wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy cart sliding up a hill, and then when you split the core again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and this leads to their breaking up if little or no pressure is applied to them.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, so the lava could be better off coming up like this.
Content theories focus on figuring out what makes people click or what attracts them.
These theories argue that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what is in their environment that will lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two factors.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when managers start mentoring their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain one of the kids.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing assessments, delegating responsibilities and putting people in front of their responsibilities.
At the other end of the spectrum, you can become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the group has done and assimilate it.
After all, the one who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups are created with the same quality principles as conventional groups, however there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a liaison with their immediate physical team.
Often, they are more autonomous than conventional group members, as their groups may meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local administration.
The existence of a truly invisible group (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p. 109) is another unique element of a virtual group.
Each person is presented to the visible management team, which sets the standards for all participants.
Why would an organization want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing organizational learning capabilities? One of the goals for the practical application of organizational learning capabilities concepts is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are fostered when all available resources in the functional departments of an organization are put to proper use.
As a result, the process by which an organisation works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes in favour of serving customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, management must create an environment for innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
The explanation given by Angel (2006) for the continuous learning approach describes it as a method used to help organizations to raise their performance level.
Neurobiological evidence provides physical evidence for a theoretical study of mind, so it narrows the breadth of the research by making it clearer.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is helpful to researchers and their study.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that humans have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes that go on in our brains.
Although artificial intelligence refers largely to science fiction, it is nevertheless an important branch of computing that deals with adapting behavior, learning and intelligence to a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence involves the construction of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning, answering customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, speech recognition and facial recognition.
These are now separate institutions, focused on providing solutions to real problems of everyday life.
AI is now commonly used in the financial, healthcare, engineering and military industries, and is even built into various home computer software applications and cyber games.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and very often a teacher would like to take his students to places where bus access is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips, where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while in class.
Essentially, taking part in a field trip is also an important opportunity to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and it's updated every year, but the old versions are kept online and serve as a dictionary.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing style. While students' experience of blogging often starts with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog editor begins to work hard to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Also, participating in blogs forces students to become more understanding about the world around them. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Managing a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn more than what they typically learn in school in the morning.
The correct use of blogs can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through active response to online material, students can define their own positions in the context of other people's texts, as well as express their own views on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's glamorous, bilingual capital city, with a wide range of galleries and museums that highlight old and new Canada.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untapped natural beauty of Muscoca and beyond.
All of this and more make Ontario the epitome of the Canadian character as perceived by outsiders.
Large areas in the even northernmost part are quite sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is itself a continent in terms of its wildlife species.
Almost all of the islets are independent or of French origin, and are renowned for providing glitzy sea shelters.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the region and it spread greatly to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when explorer Vasco da Gama, who came from Portugal, located the route that makes the Cape Colony's turn and leads from Europe to India.
The place is surrounded to the north by the Sahel, while the Atlantic Ocean encloses it on the south and west side of the country.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should declare herself married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural habits can lead to acts that would be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that's no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was created by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenians who gave it the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and gave it the name Darou I-Batija, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is among the places with the least interest in shopping in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods, like tajins, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of snacks, but they're all tourist-friendly.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a high tourist traffic in the eastern tip near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the Niragongo volcano, whose lava covered almost all the streets of the city, especially its center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be considered to understand the situation of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a station for climbing the Niaragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking and observation programs in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. Usually the price (local) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has acquired the metaphorical sense of an exotic, faraway country.
Today, Timbuktu is a deprived city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the desert sands.
It is one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates's PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely different from other cities in the country, as it has mostly an Arab rather than African air.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different areas of ecological interest each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most notable attractions and is referred to as the emblem of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are maintenance day tickets for the park.
It may be beneficial for someone to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry to either selected South African parks or all of its national parks.
Hong Kong Island is also the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a magnet for many visitors.
The glamour of the buildings that make up Hong Kong's urban landscape has been likened to a bright bar chart that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront.
Urban development on Hong Kong Island is for the most part concentrated in dry areas along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonialists occupied, and so if you're looking for clues to the colonial past of the area, it's a good place to start.
The Sudorbon is the largest coastal mangrove forest zone in the world, extending 50 miles (80 km) into mainland Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sunderbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest that is located in Indian territory is called Sunderbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not merely mangrove swamps; they include some of the last remnants of the majestic jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sudorbon covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one third is covered by water/sea zones.
Since 1966, Sudorbon has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-regional station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Boomtang, leave between 06:30 and 7:30.
Because buses between regions are usually full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are characterized by their comfort and durability.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 nG) and Punaha (200 nG).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two hallways 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The construction was completed in August 2011 and was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territory now known as eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaicuru and the Paihua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the Giant Province of the Indians, was born as a result of the conflict between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The colonial period, which lasted three centuries, began with the Spanish.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main tournament annually takes place in the last month of the year at the Las Canitas water polo pools.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news on water polo tournaments and ticketing points, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the pound sterling (GBP).
You can make currency conversions at the only bank on the islands which is in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British Pound is generally accepted throughout the islands and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
Credit cards will likely not be accepted on remote islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to see which payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to convert Falkland currency outside the islands, so do a currency conversion before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer.
The cold in winter is deceptive: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, yet the wind and humidity combine to create the feeling that it's colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, their wild nature remains wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must maintain a minimum distance of 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
As calm as bison may seem, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can still attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep proper distance, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850, and since 1959 has been the official capital of Samoa.
The port had hosted a famous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader of the Toupua Tamase Lialofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbours.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the suburb of North Harbour) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all are sandy beaches suitable for safe swimming, and most are even shaded by pochuca trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes full of families with quite a variety of shops along the coast.
The main local beer is called Number One and is not a compound beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
A wide variety of French wines are available to sample, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be a better choice.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia, the idea of flat white coffee is foreign, short black is espresso, cappuccino is inflated with cream instead of foam, and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the juices are expensive but amazing.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Nevertheless, you take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, cucumber jellyfish have been making their appearance near beaches and estuaries from October to April.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not inhabit the sea, their main natural habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking early, it ensures travellers have a place to stay once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through an agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer arrangements or even combined flight and hotel packages.
Your application may be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or to collect other documents for your trip (e.g. visa).
However, any amendments or requests should first be referred to the travel agent and not sent directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp there, and most consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you should start early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music may end at the main stages, there may be parts of the festival where the music will continue until late at night.
Some festivals provide special campsites for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of your cabin, as when the boat passes through ice it creates terrible noises for those most affected.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that visitors spend, with windows and clocks missing and exits hard to find.
Often special food, drink, and entertainment offers are made to keep customers in good spirits on the premises.
However, drunkenness affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
If you are going to drive at high altitude or through mountain passes, you should consider the possibility of snow, ice and very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is not enough friction and it is difficult to drive compared to bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, it can snow so much that you're trapped in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited during snowfall, humidity or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, where traffic continues largely uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a sight for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used as the land journey for the purpose of visiting the stunning African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars, and basic equipment will help with good visibility.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with glasses.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk or a hiking safari) consists of a hike of either a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having done so in 1964.
If you've made plans for how you'll fly and where you'll stay for 2020 before it's announced that they'll be postponed, you may be facing a tough situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies are not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with standard tickets priced at around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have irons and irons available for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or you are not interested in wearing ironed socks, you can use a sock if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas a minute of boiling is sufficient, but in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter infectious animals that they are not used to encountering in areas of their country.
Parasites spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, carry poison, and spread infections.
Infectious diseases or wild animals that have the ability to strike or kill vicious humans are not often classified as pests.
Duty-free markets provide an opportunity to source goods at specific locations without the burden of customs duties and excise duties.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save quite a bit of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is very dangerous to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, because it crosses many lonely rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: roads with long slopes, narrow lanes and steep turns dominate.
The posted speed limits are markedly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) - and it is even more important to strictly obey them.
However, oddly enough, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than along other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German sweets are of a high quality, while Bavarian sweets are of a similar variety and abundance to those of neighboring Austria.
Fruit desserts usually include apples, which are used to make sweets all year round, and cherries and plums, which appear in the summer.
A large number of German baked goods also contain almonds, nuts and other nuts.
If you want small but tasty pastries, try the so-called berliner, fankouchen, or kreppen.
Curry is made up of scents and spices, and is accompanied by food of animal or vegetable origin.
Curry can be either dry or sour, depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
Inland parts of northern India and Pakistan use yogurt as the main ingredient, while coconut juice is used in the south and other coastal parts of India.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an inclusive term that includes a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But when used without other definitions, the term tends to denote food that comes from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, the local Javanese cuisine offers a menu of lightly spicy dishes, with basic flavorings preferred by Javanese such as peanuts, chilli, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar) and many aromatic spices.
The suspension is used as a support for the lower limbs of the rider and is held by the right and left sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may pose safety challenges because of the likelihood of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and his foot gets caught in the brake, the horse may pull him onto the road as he runs.
First, most riders have special shoes that have heels, soft and relatively small bottom.
Then, some of the saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a leather hammer to fall off the saddle if pulled back by the rider as he falls.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America with a variety of large walls and granite boulders.
The peaks offer stunning views from the hills, and climbers from around the world are making new routes along the endless walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skating on downhill terrain covered in snow with a ski or snowboard placed at your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, often called ski bums, planning entire ski holidays at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old, cave paintings depict skis dating back to 5,000 BC.
Skiing as a sport can be traced back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was founded in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, snowboarding trips or alpine skiing.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but usually does not include them, as the latter are done on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a similar distance covered by hiking.
Ideally, you can cover relatively longer distances than you can by walking - but you will rarely reach the speeds of a roller coaster without a heavy backpack on specially designed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries, and under normal circumstances visiting many countries during a trip would require visa applications and multiple passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, could be said to function as a single country in this light.
As long as you are in this zone you are generally allowed to cross the border without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen area Member States, saving time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition for classifying a finished product as antique; some tax authorities define as antique goods goods that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies geographically, as the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade goods can be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important occupation for the Sami while the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who engage in other professions.
Even by tradition, of course, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but some did live off fishing, hunting and other activities, using reindeer mainly as live bait.
Today many Sami work in modern trade, and tourism is an important source of income in Sabi, the Sami region.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Roma people, the word gypsy is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccuracies about Roma.
If the country you are travelling to is subject to travel guidelines, travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the guidelines of governments other than your own, even if their guidelines are designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
The guidelines are merely an overview of domestic policy developments.
The views expressed are often concise, general and oversimplified compared with more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a general term that includes any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather events can occur in all parts of the earth and there are different categories, based on geography, topography or atmospheric conditions.

Local and seasonal adverse weather events include heavy snowfall, blizzards, hailstorms and sandstorms.
It is particularly recommended that travellers be aware of any inclement weather that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Those planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile Environments Training Courses" will likely yield the address of a local company.
A lesson, normally, will cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually because of the practice.
A course will usually last two to five days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid training and sometimes weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with desert survival are common, yet publications dealing with the war zone are few.

Transgender people in pre-operative status can't expect to get past the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Surface currents are the return flows from waves that hit the beach, often on a reef or something like that.
Because of the underwater topology, return flows are concentrated in some deeper sections where strong currents may be created at great depth.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
Once you're off the current, swimming to shore won't be any harder than normal.
You're trying to aim at a point where you've never been trapped before or, based on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it might be better to wait for rescue.
Return shock begins before culture shock (the honeymoon phase shrinks), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have difficulty adjusting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adjusted to the new culture and have lost some of your habits that were part of the culture of your home country.
When you first went abroad, people may have shown patience and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country need time to adjust.
Many may not foresee the patience and understanding needed for travelers to return home.

The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Range, with the highest elevation being the summit of Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (15,950 ft).
In isolated areas where there is no telephone service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
The satellite phone does not replace the mobile phone in general, because you would have to be in outer space with a clear field of view to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as for missions that use remote data and have voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
One increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly appealing to people who have finished school, as it allows them to take a year off before starting university without jeopardising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year abroad can increase your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are usually required for enrollment in such training programs.
Finland is an ideal place for boat trips, and in the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" you will find thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
The boat will not necessarily serve you in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the archipelago and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any pleasure boat, smaller boats or even kayaks provide an alternative experience.
Boating is a national hobby for Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand but is generally very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the rate is one in forty).
Almost all private cruises in the Baltic include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you disembark in the city only on excursions organised by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise lines include Berlin, Germany in their flyers. As shown on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a very frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and resentments about other things that a lot of people have.
For some people, understanding the operation of the aircraft and what happens during flight can help them overcome a fear of the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are paid handsomely for the quick delivery of goods. Quite often, time is a factor when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
The larger airlines have their own aircraft for some routes, but there are problems for other routes and smaller airlines.
If they sent things by air freight, on some flights it may take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it through faster would be to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where your role begins.
The obvious way to jump into the first or business position is to pay a bunch of money for the privileged position (or even better, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this comes at a cost: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy class fare for a professional class and eleven times for a first class!
In general, there is no reason to even look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a basic category of passengers who are willing to spend a lot of money for the privilege of a quick and comfortable transfer to their destination, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, however, Russian is widely spoken.

The sharpness of the Parisians will soon disappear if you show elementary civility.
The national park at Plitvice Lake is an evergreen forest, with oaks, redwoods and pines while the flora is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkable diversity of plant communities due to different microclimates, soil varieties and altitudes.
The site has a significant variety of animal and bird categories.

When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover up to the knees and shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries have long skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially bright ones, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can borrow this from the pantry in the lobby, but this particular garment is not washed after every use, and therefore you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
