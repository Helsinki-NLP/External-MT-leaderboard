Tom is not responsible.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You guys look great tonight.
We had some trouble with the unit yesterday.
Tom visited Mary on October 20.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russians.
It's simpler than it looks.
She seems like a serious, honest person to me.
Tom is an athlete.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who suggested it.
This novel isn't as good as his last.
They stayed that way for a while.
This road is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I stayed home all day reading books.
It's my decision.
It's all right.
I made him go.
Invite him to come see a movie.
Tom was a prisoner.
Hear the voice of the trumpet, and know it, and know it. The sound of the trumpet in my heart shall tell me.
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They made a joint decision about the divorce.
Stop bothering me.
I'm in a melancholy mood today.
Not much.
We plan to visit Mr. Smith tomorrow.
He's got a comfortable temper.
I don't want to leave this place ever.
My son is my biggest headache.
Please, sit down!
I can't drive a car. I don't have a driver's license.
She invited each of us for ice cream.
She was in the play.
Tom told me he hasn't seen Mary all day.
I don't like being alone on the beach.
I never plan anything.
You got a map?
Tom was sweaty.
Do I have to sell this?
They communicate by hand signals.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm really hungry.
That's hard to read.
I've been cold for a week and still haven't recovered.
We started walking again right after she recovered.
Is there an English-Japanese dictionary on the shelf?
The gun's loaded.
We're too few now.
We have to stay on our toes.
What's wrong with Tom anyway?
They had a baby.
Tom seems upset.
Maybe Tom is telling the truth.
Civilization is now mirrored by the threat of nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company has decided to hire two new secretaries.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed them both.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come at least at six.
I'm offended by your lead.
The interface is very intuitive.
I'll get it back to you right away.
Both Tom and Mary are miserable.
What group does your friend belong to?
Tom is the only one left.
Please be quiet.
Tom decided to stay behind.
Shut up, please.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Never write the words "soup for pepper" and "soup for carrots" in German!
It's a violent neighborhood.
Wonder what you can learn in a week.
There are animals that can sense a storm coming.
How can I ever forgive Tom?
This house looks abandoned.
It's the perfect place to stay.
Consult the doctor.
I'm jealous of you.
These are my friends.
She's in love with this kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound like a child.
I know you'd do the same thing to me.
In autumn, the leaves are green and slender.
Tom never mistakenly admits it, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She hasn't met Maria since.
It's the second longest river in Japan.
No one is happy.
I finally don't owe anyone.
Tom spoke in a rude way.
He's married and a father of two.
There could have been a failure in the answer.
He washes his bike every week.
Don't turn off the computer.
From that distance, you can't tell.
She got the instructions from her previous doctor and was transferred to another hospital.
I was penniless.
My best friend speaks Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I just had a couple beers.
The man who washed the car is Mr. Jones.
I owe my success to my friends.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him choking.
Go to the next page.
Have you become an angel?
I hope it can happen now.
Materials will be supplied.
Did I touch a nerve exposed?
There are plenty of places to hang out in big cities.
The first blow is half the battle.
I'm not sure about that either.
I really saw a ghost.
You recovered from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm going for a ride.
It's all about the head.
Do you happen to know where she lives?
Tom and Mary are probably going to get married one day.
Your house burned down.
I love this picture.
Get some sleep.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I've worked very hard.
Not that he's dead.
She didn't answer the question.
Oranges are high in vitamin C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
There are advantages and disadvantages to this method.
He hid the fact that he kicked out his wife.
Shut your big mouth.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
Who invented dynamite?
You're the greatest love of my life.
Experience with fruit.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing louder.
Sorry, I can't stay much longer.
I don't know if that's upside down.
Where's the toothpaste?
Let's get something cold to drink.
These are my books.
I want a guitar like John has.
It won't bother us if you take pictures from the outside.
The goal sanctifies the means.
You seem to have a lot of knowledge about it.
Are you for or against the fall?
Please don't get involved.
Long time no see.
I'm not getting an email from anyone today.
I've been waiting for you.
The cat nodded his back.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Tom is from Boston.
You want to know how I did it?
I can't find the paper.
I'm learning one language.
This microscope increases objects a hundred times.
He got into debt.
Tom is busy.
Tom wasn't the one who left the party early.
Do you speak English in Canada?
This is so impressive!
We wanted dessert.
Tom didn't get up early enough.
Hi, how can I help you?
Tom pointed his gun at the target.
I believe my friends are growing on me.
You'd better leave.
Donald Trump is suffering from dementia.
Please don't ask.
I'm coming to kill you.
I like the time between Arabs.
You should go.
You ready to go out?
I know how that sounds.
Can somebody help me out here?
Where was Tom thrown into the dungeon?
I learned from the best.
Don't rush to protect me.
That's all I know.
Don't ignore me again.
The construction area: the shielding beams must be used.
This is Tom's closet.
I certainly wouldn't recommend Tom for the position.
You should try not to forget what time it is.
Are you going to the United States next year?
Think about your future.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It rained yesterday.
She got caught with her pants down.
I know you might think I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go that way.
How's everybody feeling?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Did you have breakfast today?
There's a bridge three kilometers up the river.
Tom suggested Mary not to do that.
I know you think there's no hope.
The judges made a decision.
Is it hard to learn Greek?
He goes to the library to read books.
They live in this town.
The sky will be clear soon.
I didn't like Tom.
We're trying to learn here.
Please, I'll adopt this puppy.
It's impossible to provide it.
Go back to your chair.
She chose a hat to fit her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday in my house.
Let's not do anything that might upset Tom.
I'm running out of money.
I'll finish reading this novel soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's going on.
I don't want you to see my daughter again.
You guys don't go out there.
Tom drinks about three liters of water a day.
We'll never agree.
We're glad we were alive.
Some newspapers have distorted the news.
Sign this, please.
That's my car.
I'd love to see that.
This pen is the best.
Admiring heroes is a dangerous thing.
Tom says he doesn't want to get into this anymore.
The white paper.
Drinks are half the price up to six.
The sky is clear almost every day.
Well, I lied.
Whatever you do, don't come complaining to Tom about it.
Paris is very enchanted with Japanese youth.
This bridge is three times as long as it is.
I tried not to eat too much.
Tom seems desperate.
They slept in the same bed.
His success depends on his efforts.
I got a lot of hats.
Settlers built their houses along the river.
It was impossible to remove the lid.
It was a very exciting day.
I'm on it.
Just the essential corrections, please.
Salt, please.
Have you decided where to have lunch?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from the house.
I ran.
Tom is an accountant.
Raise your left hand.
I doubt the veracity of his statement.
I think they've got some kind of problem.
This movie is boring.
Where to go and what to see were my main concerns.
My longest romantic relationship lasted four months.
She's never told me before.
Tom has an old hat he always wears in the rain.
