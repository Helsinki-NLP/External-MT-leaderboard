It's a good deal.
I really want to see you today.
"I understand Italian perfectly", she stared as she picked a dish from the menu, but when the food was served, it was not what she expected.
Let's get to the theater early so we can find good seats.
My aunt is older than my mother.
The problem is they don't have any money.
I don't have time to finish my homework.
If it wasn 't for her , I wouldn 't be alive today .
You're wrong, that's not the issue.
Sammy started spending a lot of time with Layla. They became synchronized.
I can't do that.
We agreed to split the house-cleaning duties between us.
Sami is a young college student who loves to party.
We wear uniforms at our school.
Sami got a call from Fred's daughter.
His memory amazes me.
I have a letter from her for you.
Did you manage to convince Fadil?
I'm talking about him.
Don't worry, I'll stay with you.
She's the only one I know.
Can I go with him?
You move forward.
Layla was giving a Sunday school class.
Sami gave Layla more medicine.
She's in love with Tom.
The town grew into a city.

I do some light exercise every morning.
Tom is no doubt having fun.
She was nice to me.
No swimming .
There was a sofa in Sammy's office.
It sounded crazy.
Sami sat opposite Layla.
Sami returned to Egypt.
It's hard for me as a doctor to say that about another doctor, but it's the truth.
An elephant has a long nose.
Sami got upset.
Sami knocked Layla unconscious.
All the teachers were here.
Those are her shoes.
When the wind blew, the candle went out.
Sami made a decision that no one can force him to compromise.
It is a fake.
Don't you remember him?
Tom is waiting for a response.
The sun shone down on the hills.
Sami was facing a life sentence.
He speaks English with a German accent.
I can send you my brain dictionary.
Tom doesn't sing anymore.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
Fadil joined a state university in Philadelphia.
We have no choice but to continue.
Can you recommend a good place to eat Korean food?
I saw you cooking.
That factory makes toys.
I'll take him up.
Sit on the table.
I'm going to save you all.
I don't want him to know the truth.
He wasn't my teacher.
Tom ran very fast.
I'm from Australia.
We know that the sun is bigger than the Earth.
I 'm not feeling so good today .
Actually, that's why I'm here.
Thanks for coming.
Go help your brother!
She didn 't come because her boyfriend didn 't come .
I was just laughing.
How will I repay my debts now?
Light the wax can.
Give the book to the one I want.
We finally got to the lake.

The cuckoo is New Zealand's worst enemy of birds.
The rest is up to you!
Tom was alone at home.
The first lesson is easy.
I hit him with a pen.
Sami was walking his dog.
The perrania confused me.
Fadil lived on a street named Sadik.
Which one is Tom's car?
Most of the leaves fell.
The hospital opened last month.
Sammy had a bug under his clothes.
Sami's past is on him.
I have your journals.
Fadil turned the door handle quietly and entered the house.
Sami shook that tree.
They talk about this and that.
I have an Italian neighbor.
Sami went on vacation.
- Get on the wheel and roll.
I'll shoot him.
Where was Tom born?
Israel knows what to do with the West Bank, but it doesn't seem to know what to do with Gaza.
She's got something.
I go to school by bus.
No, work.
Sami wanted to make Layla love him.
The book is here .
Sami came closer.
"Tatoeba" means "for example" in Japanese.
I think he's right.
Have someone else do it, please.
Japanese people like to travel in groups.
Wait for me in my office.
I see your point.
We were just talking .
Let's have a look.
You're in my way.
This bus will take you to the airport.
He was wearing a blue sweater.
The police collected a lot of evidence from the crime scene.
Maybe he was sick.
It doesn't matter where he came from.
What do you think you're doing?
You know what I mean?
It's because of me.
Tom likes to go out.
Sami's fate is in the hands of a jury.
Nancy looked like she was a total jerk.
It's worth ten logs.
Just fifteen minutes.
This is the window that he broke.
Little Tom has a crush on Mary.
We discussed the plan with him.
What did you study in college?
Don't say anything until you think about it.
Nobody believed his story.
He was hit by a car.
The crescent and star are symbols of Islam.
Mary ran.
Complaining all the time.
I like the room overlooking the valley.
Where's the nearest art gallery?
Tom and Mary play racquetball.
Fadil believes in the Lord of Islam.
Sami's life was in danger.
Sami rented a room at the hotel.
Jamie, you have no time for the importunate stuff!
Dima sighs and says, "I see, sorry about the mess, enjoy the Fanta, and have a nice day".
Let's split the cost.
I hope to see you again.
We don't have to do this every day.
Sami's car hit the parapet of a bus stop.
I have a cat and a dog.
Layla will be brought to justice.
As in heaven, so on earth.
Idre is my favorite singer.
Did the cat eat your tongue?
I yelled at the teacher.
I'll see you later.
What does "get" mean in this sentence?
I walk every day.
The shopkeeper asked, "But don't you think it's a little too big?"
Why are you so rude?

I have no excuse.
She got rich .
I'll try not to disturb you while you study.
You have to go back.
And say, "The truth is from your Lord. Let him who will, believe, and let him who will, disbelieve.
Sami disrespected Layla.
Fadil knew the police could arrive at any moment.
Where is the British Embassy?
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.
Does this dog bite?
A good club, Dania.
Sami was serving a life sentence.
She put the magazine on the table.
Sammy called Lila, asked her to come and pick him up.
Sami never feels comfortable.
Sami offered to tell the police everything he knew.
How far is the park from your house?
This is my house.
Thank you for the information.
Let's get ready to go.
Sami looked down.
Layla outsmarted Sammy.
A drug dealer was arrested at the airport.
Did you see that, Jamal?
I use twitter.
Give me your credit card, please.

It might take a while.
I remember seeing her once on the road.
A shout knows.
They're gay.
When did the meeting end?
The thick fog made the road difficult to see.
Take your time, Yoshida.
It wasn't her!
She said not to touch me.
Sami came to the clinic to meet Layla.
I'd better ask her that.
Marico speaks English fluently.
I don't care what other people say.
Tom didn't want to dance with Mary.
What about you?
This is not a white candle.
Yesterday was my birthday.
She talks like she knows everything about him.
Sami was an ambulance driver.
Sami killed a whore.
She likes oranges.
You dive in, and your predatory fish will eat you.
Why is the sky blue?
I was late because of the traffic.
She accused me of lying.
Should the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza be welcomed if they're expelled?
I'm taking you home.
Fadil expressed his grief.
I looked around.
Sami's life has changed forever.
It's too big.
A white Arab.
She has blue eyes.
We're celebrating the conception of Layla.
We won the game.
The police continued to search Fadil's car.
Come to the front.
Does Toshio like Satsuki?
I fixed the bike yesterday.
Sammy is out of the woods.
Give it back!

Do you speak Turkish?
To the scar on his face.
Fadil fell in love with an Egyptian woman.
Do you like running?

We have to ask Tom's forgiveness.
Fadil is becoming interested in Arabic.
I asked Dima, "What do you mean?" but he was baffled, because if he had remained silent, this sentence would have been very simple.
I tried to get Charles to help me, but he wouldn't.
Sami was having fun.
He took every opportunity.
Sami has greatly expanded his double life.
We ate a whole shipment of apples.
The grass needs a weeding.
Show me how it works.
Anyway, that's not the important thing.
May I ask where you're going?
It's Tom's turtle. Her name is Mary.
I hope the summer never ends.
Sami wanted to give Layla more money.
Do you speak English?
Sami has no right to do that.
All her cats are sitting on the roof of her car.
Sam was handcuffed to a hospital bed.
I'm glad to hear your voice.
Layla joined a neo-Nazi camp.
Open the gate.
Sammy was a resident physician at a local hospital.
What a poor flower.
He's just a guy.

I owe my success to their help.
You talk too much.
They arrived separately.

What kind of Japanese food do you like?

The student came from London.
Hey, get off my bike.
He hasn't heard from Layla.
He was a substitute teacher.
Sami slapped Layla again.
I don't know if Tom is hungry or not.
Sami waited six weeks.
Sami's videos have been deleted from YouTube.
This game seems a little dangerous.
I'm getting cold.
Good always wins.
Nancy smiled happily.
Tom answered the call.
All the bananas you brought me yesterday were rotten.
Sami and Layla were having sex with each other.
I want to buy.
You went to the wrong address.
I have no more than 1,000 yen .
Do you drink alcohol?
With a little grace, the cat leapt to the ledge, but he missed and fell to the ground.
There was never a Fadil there.
Fadil's mother described her son as a good boy.
Is it too expensive?
"Where were you?" "I was in a meeting. " "In a meeting on the beach with Sammy?"
I want to be a fireman.
Sami kept sending texts to Layla.
Are you free tomorrow?
I don't blame you for hitting him.
Nobody understands what's going on.
He 's running .
I came.
Sami was thinking about his life.
I'll sue you.

Tom is reading the Bible.
Music is a universal language.
What 's your favorite TV show ?

But I don't want to escape, I want to see Italy.
I've been looking forward to this all week.
You can always sleep on my couch.
School starts at 8:30.
Layla cooked dinner for Fazal.
She went to bed at ten o'clock yesterday.
Perhaps, you would prefer a French dish.
What are you waiting for?
The car's coming up on the right.
Stress can have a significant negative impact on your health.
Why would we want to do that?
You don't despise a man because he's poor.

What exactly are you looking at ?
I love listening to music with you.
And keep walking for a while.
Sami figured it out.
What would you like to eat?
Is that your sister?
Sami borrowed Layla's car.
I want to buy you a present.
Sami tried to escape justice.
Sami turned himself in to the police.
Where does he live?
Is that your car?
Call me as soon as you find Tom.
I wasn't alone.
This idea doesn't make sense.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
They went to dinner at a fancy restaurant.
Don't forget to think before you speak.
I want you to read it.
Sami did well.
He cried.
- What are you doing ?
Sami was friends with Layla's friends.
Sami is listening.
The rain turned to snow.
I'm not going unless you tell me where to find Tom.
We've been through three wars.
You think he did it alone?
I'm from Palestine.
Don't look at her!
My son went to London, where I was born.
Everyone was happy.
Where do you play tennis?
That's beyond my comprehension.
Get out of your bed!
Who's that boy?
Do you have a key to this door?
A cat came out from under the desk.
I understand your language.
You might have to fire her.
A hand has five fingers.
We can't wait for dinner.
I 'm not swimming in this lake .
Not every question is worth answering.
Sami was confused.
Who stole the apple?
I'm sure it will work.
Are you talking to me?
We are facing a huge crisis.
Did Tom give you this water gun ?
You're giving this too much credit.
Sami was living a strange life.
He was never happy.
Sami doesn't have his gun with him.
This boat is seaworthy.
I used to think it was my duty to help Tom.
Mary wanted to know if Tom had a girlfriend.
You're not the first one to make that mistake.

How many times have you been?
We should do this every day.
If you're a man, act like one.
He'll probably be here soon.
I'm worried about him.
You've decided to quit smoking.
You only hear these noises in your head.
Layla wanted to get attention.
Why did you say that?
I'm a little taller than you.

You're not the woman Sammy deserves.
Where's my watch?
