Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, they have 29 percent of the total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria have brought about a significant weakening of the two parties forming the present grand coalition, as well as a marked strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthia's Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain the leading political force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost almost nine percent of the vote, ended up even worse.
This is the worst result for the two major parties of the post-war period, and for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
But the voters were clearly punishing them for letting the government fall.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the party leader and current Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer was voiced.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, at the extraordinary party leadership meeting.
Such a development would facilitate the path to the outcome of the election which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP grand coalition.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FPÖ) reportedly won 18 percent and the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - the socialists at the same time expressed fears of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still unified, the BZÖ split from it in 2005) on a joint government, which even prompted sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already said that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently based on this development.
The last party to gain access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
Clearly, no other party crossed the four per cent threshold and got into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India of illegal cockroach harvesting is not resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that Czech-Indian relations would become somewhat cooler.
The Minister said this today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem is not solved, then yes, there will be a certain cooling", he said after the meeting, which was held on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, coming out of the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
It mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government of Darjeling, since the case was placed under the jurisdiction of the local government.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
Mukherjee said the best solution for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He said he could now apply for bail and await trial in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same view during the talks.
"He advises that an appeal be made to a higher court, after which he may be pardoned", says the Czech foreign minister.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such aid had already been provided by India.
"We wish above all to maintain with India the best possible relations, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomology.
"We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech researchers a great miscarriage", he said.
The minister dodged the question of whether he had obtained a promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I have already received a fairly large number of promises", he merely observed.
A Czech referee fights for the seabed
He approaches an electronic wall map, which shows Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
He is not interested in the continent, but in a tiny spot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is as big as the continent itself", says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
The head of the department, Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The atmosphere is characterized by hard work and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a world of little known resources.
There may be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also previously unknown living organisms, which may hold the key to developing a cancer drug.
A deeper depth than the land
The coastal states have begun to aspire with vigour to new underwater territories.
They are indeed exercising their rights according to a UN convention, which was agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is especially the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country in question.
The latter may, according to the Convention, have an exclusive claim to all the resources of the continental shelf.
'For the sake of simplicity, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles which represent the exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request from the country concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a large scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly prospects and measurements.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the committee with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful", adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions, has recently been a global phenomenon.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission assigned to it last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, which is six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The future benefits of exploiting the seabed will be, as they project, inestimable.
Gradually, other countries will also submit their applications.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
At the end of the continental shelf begins the area of the ocean floor, which has been declared by convention to be "the common heritage of mankind".
No State is now in an exclusive position.
The right to extract in this zone is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"But let's not make a mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike", says the director Mikulka, exaggerating, adding that "its zones are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc under the joint "Interoceanmetal" organisation.
In 1991, the company, together with investors from a few other States, was granted the status of a pioneer investor under the Convention.
It has mining rights in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor is slightly larger than the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rough, and it's a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract oil from a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives an example of this.
It reminds me of a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene for the hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but they never went into action.
More and more details are being revealed about the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists from the Federal Army and officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the liberation site.
As the ministry spokesman said Monday evening, German forces were ultimately not called in, as the hostage takers released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened so far", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had abducted the group of five tourists from southern Egypt, five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight Egyptian companions.
After being kidnapped in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were shipped to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has remained unclear, as have details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were rescued arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are expected to have taken off on an Air Force Airbus and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout
The first chamber of the US Congress nearly scrapped the $700 billion financial-market bailout.
The Dow Jones was sinking into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout for financial markets.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and from leading politicians of both parties, the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets failed to win a majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the validity of this heavy $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debate, had called for a vote in favor of the plan, although it was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened", he conceded.
During the vote, the Dow Jones was down more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concern that the state bailout plan might be overturned.
It went up shortly before the vote was over, and then fell again after the announcement of the defeat.
Experts now project further serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
For the programme to enter into force, approval by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate is required.
Organisers report a growing number of bookings
It should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to one study, turnover has increased significantly compared with the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 per cent.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the German travel appetite remains insatiable, according to the study.
As regards bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared with the same period last year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing numbers of bookings are already dominating the autumn months.
The sales figure would have risen to around 11 per cent more compared with 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are the figures of GfK, which analyses monthly booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
The low value of the dollar would make travel to the USA particularly popular, the DRV said.
This would mean an increase of about one third in bookings.
Besides that, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our country, would be particularly desirable destinations for Germans.
The President of the DRV, Klaus Laepple, explained that organized trips are particularly in demand.
In view of rising energy and food prices, costs would be "easier to calculate for the customer than for an individual trip".
Consumers can save money with discounts on early bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months were also very short, so that sales figures will again increase compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
Ballermann hits and Apres-Ski on the go, beer in pitchers and celebrities in Tyrolean designer suits.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, a TV host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean suit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing that unites us: barely three minutes into the beer party, and already the photographers are jumping on us and filling out their memory cards -- very flattering, and that's my first visit to the beer party.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean suit seems to be achieving its goal.
As a tourist at the beer festival and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in traditional costume has so far been limited.
But once you're in Place Therese, things are half as bad.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks disfigured or affected by shame - that's perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean suit gets a few strange looks at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out that I had not properly tied my apron. "Left means free, middle means virgin, right means married, back is widowed".
I'm discreetly flipping my loop from the back to the left.
"That's better", she says, and laughs.
Others don't bother with these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple signs that say "Too drunk to get dressed!" and show their naked buttocks without being invited.
The exhibitionist young man is called Bob, he's from England and he's coming to the beer party for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", with a long "ooooo".
He tells me all this after he's relieved himself of the scotch he had before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild pissers".
Others are not so fortunate as to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock at night, a swarm of rescuers rushes to the party square and must deal with the poor drinkers.
Rather, the nurses come in packs - always in fours, dragging their tent-covered stretchers from tent to tent.
This is how it works for most beer party guests: you go empty, you come back full.
Those who lie in the coffin of the drunkards under the tarp are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't swallow anything anymore", one of the rescuers shouted in response to my question and then disappeared into the fray.
Police identified accident victim
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon crash in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been out on bail since.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was even thinking of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 paces from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha Station was designed in a neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each corner, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the greatness of the company, which represents a gateway to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that reaches Damascus, Baghdad and the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of the surrounding region, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the Imperial forces advanced beyond Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the station in Hyderpasha.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling apart, mired in the tangles of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to emphasize the widening of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding region, brought about by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new policy on commitments.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping carriage heading for the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10.5 hour journey, I was shaken along noisy rails with a rhythm reminiscent of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, and finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning its back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots, represents an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and Washington in particular.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a state-of-the-art structure, built specifically of stone and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and numerous pastry shops where middle managers in suit-tie - men and women - meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
He's got a suit, a tie, and he even has a blackberry.
"the aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she must be looking east and west at the same time.
Neither of them did.
She had to do both.
"but, at a certain point, I asked if Turkey should not choose".
"Turkey", he said, "does not want to have to choose between the two".
He then pointed out an aspect which almost everyone I spoke to recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the railways to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another sleepless night, I thought of those two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched this building being built 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions in the Middle East could, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal for the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the time when Turkey was called the sick man of Europe.
At least there's no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us over 20 refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the choir's willingness and ability to handle any type of music presented to it, whether it was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod kept telling us to "let the music speak for itself".
He'd say, "The composer knows what he wants".
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His technique of the wand was absolutely clear, precise, though never dictatorial or flashy.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there's one driver who should be knighted, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years, I've reviewed over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me - and, on a few occasions, they've even inspired me.
Tod Handley possessed such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, "focused on just a few people".
We're gonna miss him a lot.
I'm not sure.
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950, while doing a BSc, MA and PhD".
This is what comes out of a letter from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and was at the same time completing a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and '51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Houblon, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino, 'Flamenco and Life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
A display that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments".
Second blow to Honda's sales
In November, Honda will begin the second generation of the Jazz model.
While its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even larger interior space.
In addition, there are some refined mechanics that increase the comfort of the driver and save more fuel.
Evolution is a revolution.
So this is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz is aesthetically very similar to the previous model, there are many changes introduced in this minivan.
Among them are innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before we examine the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation was launched.
Firstly, it is noted that Honda has refurbished this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, it is a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
For example, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000 units, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish branch hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to compensate for the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand hopes to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters in length - with which the Japanese company hopes to sell nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be in the United States, while the other half will be split between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first three months of next year, following its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five centimetres more), its width 1.69 metres (two centimetres more), and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which is an increase of five centimetres.
However, the height of the tower remains the same - 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space is also increasing.
This is due to the introduction of a new platform and the introduction of a central fuel tank, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system  can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to the exterior elements such as the tail lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared with the rear doors of the first Jazz which opened at an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation Jazz.
At the start of its commercial operation, this small model will be equipped with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology which reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, making the engine more powerful and increasing engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine developed a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared with the previous engine, which had 83 horsepower on the previous generation, it now has 100 horsepower.
This 100-horsepower 1.4L Honda Jazz has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, particularly bees.
A Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It's called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and it represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow the brand's vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal oval-shaped space that looks a lot like the Nissan safety shield.
But most importantly, the bee's compound eyes, which can see at an angle of over 300 degrees and in all directions, allow it to fly uninterrupted within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser range finder.
The computer detects obstacles within a two-meter radius and a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to the object, and immediately sends a signal to the microprocessor to avoid the obstacle.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forking its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid a collision.
The biggest difference from any other system in existence is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Displacement Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down or diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it to do, not in infinite directions like bees.
For this purpose, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
Every second this device only has to process information and act on that data.
It does not need to store the information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
It may be surprising, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes".
This represents the first development car for new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in about a decade according to Nissan.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and longer lasting than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be to adapt this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be admitted that the United States Treasury, besides having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from getting into mortgages with credit-worthy banks, they created a game to learn how not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel.'
It means "Hotel of bad credit" or stories.
The gloomy appearance of this apartment and especially the hotel manager's, makes us think repeatedly whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
Sure, this game gives us some useful information, but it's not very detailed.
It's more of a teenage game.
What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, into the round, which will pay out $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a news greeted by a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after unveiling a tentative agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a unit price of $25.25 - a total of $3 billion.
The price taken is 19% below the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional USD 6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities providing a 10% return and a conversion price of USD 31.25.
Morgan Stanley has stated that the overall transaction would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of $29 or 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley stock was down 6.79% to $23.07 at 5:00 PM GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status", explained John Mack, the chief executive officer of the US group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new charter last week, which should allow it to diversify its business but bring it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms of the deal presented on Monday also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago", explained Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, in Tokyo, "we thought that the holding would be entirely composed of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise the risks and cover ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of approximately 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within one year if the latter trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to give details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier 1 solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "significantly" lightened his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a trying time for the group, which has seen its stock price melt by half as the cost of insurance against a default on its debt soared.
This cost was down on Monday but remained at a high level of around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, part of it from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Rebuild the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished, with 64% of voters voting "yes" in the referendum, according to official results with 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" vote was 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to pass, it had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organisation announced a large victory for the "yes" vote, with 63% to 70% voting.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution in the night from Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly", he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the governorate headquarters in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was conducted in a calm manner by the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, focused on a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving for it the "development planning" of a country that lives mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants the head of state increased powers, which will allow him to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will give him the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and run for a second term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched an assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive for ten days in the desert were safely returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, docked at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, by helicopter to the Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers", said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19th during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group included 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, which organised the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported by two helicopters, launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"A gunfight occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fleeing", said the official, who asked not to be named.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces unit "Blitz" had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence men, the special forces", he said, without elaborating.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers during a patrol, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudanese United Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is occupying this election campaign.
That's good.
But one aspect of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums that are being spent on the small museums, archives, archaeological digs, or national historic sites that are starving to death?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we have no real laws to actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore the only Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in their country's constitution that the protection of heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and that in concert.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogical societies are concerned with researching history, preserving private archives and archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when promoters and policymakers hurl their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a platform for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux countries are helping the Belgo-Dutch bank, the first European banking institution to be in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it. e three countries are providing EUR 11.2 billion in support of this financial and insurance institution which also has interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments reached agreement at the highest level on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been intensifying for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back almost half (49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its holdings, among which, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch entity ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares started a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis were already revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to let it go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company's stock fell 12 percent, reaching its lowest level in 14 years.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the capital of the group is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's management, is not realistic.
The company's management blames uncertainty overseas, in connection with the adoption of the US $700 billion bailout plan, for the fall in Fortis stock.
On Monday, the paper has already seen a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to the bank's board of directors as its new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but had not yet received a substantive proposal.
The Belgian government had previously announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt among the bank's clientele and no agencies were assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about his drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There are data protection programmes which bind the use of prescribing information to the consent of the data subject in all cases.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like giving your henhouse to a fox", Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage dependent on the health condition of the customer, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they would send candidates for a medical examination, and they would sign an insurance contract with them only after they heard the results.
For the last ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies, the data on the person's purchases of medicines in the last eighteen months. From this, the program itself determines, what disease the person suffers from and what is his state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this programme are in circulation, some of which determine a risk coefficient at the same time, so there is little left for the insurer to do other than paperwork.
One of the disadvantages of this program is that one drug can be used for different purposes, for example, some mixtures can be used for migraines or hot flashes, but can also be effective for depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have developed in research and data analysis, and they must obtain the patient's consent before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
Now they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for past failures.
Recently, some companies are also processing lab results and linking them to data on drug use, in this way they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and controlling their use is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to extend the scope of government control over companies specialising in data provision is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard recognises that this is not enough and has therefore developed his programme further, which would make the transmission of data subject's exclusive consent a condition.
It is another question whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent, since if he or she refuses, the insurers do not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
So, in the end, the chickens depend on the fox's kindness.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
As the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this topic also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other issues, largely global.
Today will also be a summit between France and India, where cooperation on atomic energy will be the main topic of discussion.
The European Union recognises that India is a major emerging democratic power which should be given a wider say in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi's candidacy for permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue yesterday at the ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Foreign Affairs, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double trade, which means an increase of well over 100 billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be a very ambitious target.
In this respect, they have legally harmonised the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil aviation, thus enabling air trade to grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009 at the latest.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's largest trading partner, and New Delhi, the EU's ninth largest trading partner.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as were all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on this subject was discussed.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate agenda, including a reduction of at least 20% of toxic emissions by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as the fact that a global market should be reached at the climate conference next year, and greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent food prices from rising, and have supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is today in the French capital, where he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the deal is for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
A large number of Italian publishers attended the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries to take up the 171,790 square metres of the fair with over 403 thousand titles on display, with Turkey as the guest of honour.
The Italian Government will be represented at the opening ceremony of the Italian Butterfly by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will be present in an institutional capacity, with a 264 m2 exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press conference in the Struktur Room, in the 5.0 Butterfly of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of publishing in Italy.
The data show that the importance of books by foreign authors is gradually declining in relation to total Italian production, and in particular in relation to adult and children's books.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an elevation of 3,000 meters in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, no human remains, though.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the plane Steve Fosset was on the day he disappeared", he said at a news conference.
The sheriff's office said no human remains were found on or around the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead.
The US Transportation Safety Bureau (TSA) said that a few hours after the wreckage was spotted, an investigative team sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
It's two documents in Fosset's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was stopped a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned himself a place in history through a long series of records.
On his sixth attempt, in 2002, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world flight in an aerostatic balloon - a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world non-stop.
Among all these records, there is the one of flying at 15,445 meters in the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the commercial you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 with a distinct and original design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
In short, this is the Glk, the latest in the "compact" off-road models from the star manufacturer, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a new lease of life to the sector.
The communication accompanying the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will be unexpected and unconventional, precisely because of its out-of-standard content.
The advertising hype that will accompany the launch of the new car will result in a new communication modality, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan's shopping mall, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication involves presenting the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, it would seem that when looking at the picture, the car is out of the picture.
Then, through the use of innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in detail, according to the spots, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is clear that with this advertisement Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will this formula succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers?
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are the 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, has never caused any major problems.
He's never had a run-in with the other fans.
The group extraction is right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolor flags with their hometown on them. On Saturday night, they were all taken away so they could not be identified.
They're inspired by the English typhus.
In Bulgaria, they found a Nazi-style typhoon-setting called the Levski.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominated, and thus easily verifiable.
And Viminal had all of them checked out: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, were not eligible for the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it may be that the fans arrested or identified in the riots serve a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids the visit of Italian and European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will never set foot in the stadium again.
I'm glad you did.
But now is the time for fear-molding: that is, others may be added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this", says the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes peeled especially for Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In fact, there is a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the outstretched arm during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
This is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Observatory of the Criminal (he took over the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect of Trieste, where a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to hire Mussolini, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhosis was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds No. 1 of the Observatory, "crimes must be attributed to the country in which the act takes place.
Until now, this group has remained within the rules, now we will look at what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to the Mameli anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you'll excuse me, they're not polite...
