Prague Stock Market falls to minus at the end of the trading day.
After a sharp drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Market corrected its losses.
Transactions with stocks from Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) reached nearly half of the daily trading.
The Prague Stock Market immediately continued its fall from Monday at the beginning of Tuesday's trading, when it dropped by nearly six percent.
This time the fall in stocks on Wall Street is responsible for the drop.
The market reaction to the results of the vote in the American House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the financial sector there, has also manifested itself here.
Asia stocks fall
Asian markets experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, but the indexes ultimately recovered some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong Stock Exchange took off nearly four percent during the day, but later it erased a part of the losses and reduced the decrease to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock market, declined by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Listed shares in Sydney lost more than five percent but ultimately reduced their losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan declined by 3.6 percent according to the local index.
The time of the bailout action in the USA is uncertain and it will affect financial markets all over the world," said the head of Hong Kong Currency Board, Joseph Yam.
Although it is part of China, Hong Kong does not have a central bank dependence on it, which is essentially without being dependent on the Chinese Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
Soon American legislators should return to negotiations and approve the bill to support the financial system, according to Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Otherwise there is a threat that other countries will also feel the impact.
American stock bloodbath
The American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, into which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 billion Czech crowns) was to be invested.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's appeal to support the plan.
The plan would tackle the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
American stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday and the major stock indexes registered their highest decline in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index declined by nearly seven percent, having previously registered a similar-ranging decline in 1987.
The index had already dropped prior to the vote, but as soon as the House revealed that the bill was not passing, the index went into free fall.
Congress yields: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and George W. Bush's cabinet have agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement.
The vote on it will be held in the beginning of next week.
They made a breakthrough in their talks about a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system amounting to 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion crown).
All is not yet won.
The members of Congress have to complete some details of the agreement before they can make the final version of the law public and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
The Chair of the Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters on Sunday.
Sources say that the senate could probably vote on the plan on Wednesday at the earliest.
Economists believe that the announcement of the bailout plan will be the first psychological factor significant to the revival of financial markets.
Afterwards, however, a "sobering up" will occur due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which assistance to the markets can be achieved in practice.
Planning must be effective
"We have made great progress.
They have resolved our differences on how the package for the stabilization of markets should look.
The final vote could take place as early as Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators meet with American Finance Minister Henry Paulson Saturday night in order to give the government fund a final form.
The fund is aimed at acquiring unsellable mortgage assets that are driving financial companies into heavy losses and are threatening the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will function and must also be effective on the market.
It is necessary to continue in the curative plan, but I think we are there.
Asian trading signal
The global financial crisis is significantly impacting the stock markets, which are dropping sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic senator Harry Reid, that is how the legislators are trying to get a definitive agreement as early as Sunday.
The aim of the executive order is to calm investors prior to trading on the Asian financial markets, which, given their timezones, are to calm investors prior to trading on Monday's trading.
In the meantime, it is still unclear with any certainty when both American Congress will vote on the bill, nor if the negotiations will be hindered by any problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the bill will still go through a series of changes.
The total amount designated for assistance to the system is divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars are to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
The Congress can block the release of the remaining amount, in order to add further 100 billion dollars and later, the final 350 billion dollars if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations
Though the president can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
In spite these changes, the essential idea of the program, to gain finances for the buyout of bad mortgage stocks, the value of which had declined because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortgages, remains intact.
"We have drawn it all up.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday.
Even American President Bush is satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
The speaker Tony Fratto declared that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and save our economy.
Golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said the legislators agreed on the responsibilities for the financial program, protection of the taxpayers against losses, closing of relief packages, and time of the financial plan.
The new law also aims to restrict the "golden parachutes" for the head of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee that will monitor the fund.
The Committee is to be directed by the Finance Minister.
Working hard on this and we have made great progress towards a workable and effective agreement for all Americans.
The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who have problems making payments.
The cabinet should negotiate new payments for the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly payment costs for those in debt and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is good, but its realization will be very difficult.
This is because it is unclear how and for what price the problematic assets will be acquired.
The financial sector and the cabinet will divide the losses among themselves, Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week.
The plan is not so important, according to Marek.
More important is to agree this week to support the plan and to approve it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time.
Razor's edge battle: MP3 players vs. cell phones.
Our advice on how to choose a pharmacy
While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
This makes it clear that it is better to only buy a phone.
In spite this, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice is entirely based on the use and needs of the future owner.
It is unlikely you will get a top-of-line expensive record player to listen to the newest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
First of all such music products are not available on LPs, but also, from a quality perspective there is no objective reason for it.
If your shelves are filled with art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl records you are likely to dream of a record player like that.
It is the same with travel music, that is compressed music, simply called MP3 music.
There are price and quality categories also.
However, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on an MP3 player, as a Pink Floyd fan can accept twenty-crown headphones from a market hall.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
selection is broad.
Battery life also decides
Some top-level music players can do much more than play music, but also do things most cell phones cannot do by chance.
No modern machine is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the main functions of calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, and can even navigate in some cases.
If we take smart phones and communication devices, you have a small computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle, as no refrigerator knows how to grill and no television can take pictures.
The universal nature of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the charger will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the most important energy sources.
Very few cell phones can play music for longer than ten to 12 hours, most of them much less.
In this way, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more efficient.
The reason for this is that inexpensive cell phones will not play for more than a few hours.
If you occasionally make calls in addition to that, to be safe, get another charger for your office - even for more expensive devices.
You will not have this problem with MP3 players, even worse ones last for at least 9 straight hours on one charge.
Other problem occurs when recording music on the cell phone.
The majority of the devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
The music can be recorded directly onto a memory card, but very few card reader can handle the small memory cards used in the cell phones without an adaptor.
For music players, with some exceptions (iPod), you do not need any special software.
It is enough to fill the device with music from the computer.
Most cell phones and music players have already created a music library by themselves, organized by the artist's name, album title, genre or, e.g. user rating.
Some devices only display the tree structure of the directory, similar to Windows Explorer and some are able to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an OS).
Artists easier to service, cell phones can do more
In selecting specific equipment, you should be concerned with the life of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of audio output, and of course the user-friendly nature of the operation.
If music is a background setting for you and you are only going to listen to it for a short time, perhaps in the tram, any cell phone which plays MP3 is enough.
What almost any cell phone is able to do.
You do not even have to look at the formats your phone or music player can handle.
The MP3 can handle all of them, and most of your music will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread formats and almost all devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is the appearance of AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better cell phones, along with the availability of music on-line, allow the purchase of music on-line.
All you have to do to buy a song or album is visit the pages of the given operator (or another provider) using mobile Internet.
This service by itself could be a substantial reason for acquiring a music cell phone.
The offerings from the operators are poor and usually limit to fast-growing radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
It is generally assumed that this very manner of music sales (whether using GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will take over the music industry in the future.
Most people have their cell phone on them all the time.
If you feel like listening to something, you can take your cell phone in your pocket, and the MP3 player lies at home, forgotten.
However, it still depends on whether you always have headphones or at least the hands-free wire with you.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker that is in most cell phones, but only in a minimum of MP3 players.
The greatest advantage of music cell phones for many people is the price.
The most expensive of them regularly cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three or four thousand crowns you can get a very good walkman.
However, you'll be restricted by the absence of output on ordinary headphones.
The most technically well-equipped telephones, with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones, can cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
The other advantage of the music players is, among other reasons, that they are easy to use.
Anyone can handle the operation of the simplest - not necessarily the most inexpensive (see our selection).
The minimum functions and similarity in operation to the former common cassette recorder or even the record player is apparent.
There is no threat of clash in the form of accidental mobile Internet turned on by accident and the resulting huge data transmission cost.
What device to reach for
Even the most expensive cell phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for replaceable memory cards (such as M2, microSD and the like).
Even with the addition of the respective card you will spend less than two thousand crowns.
Be careful, however.
With the basic models, only cards with maximum capacity of 2 GB tend to be supported.
Only the most expensive ones can also handle 8 GB memory cards.
If you have a cell phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, look for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung or iriver.
Based on capacity (maximum 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are more demanding, use specialized cell phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung models).
This device has separate control buttons for MP3 and the user-friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately, is the most advanced in the field.
The MP3 players from the above mentioned brands provide the same service and in the same price range up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, maximally up to 35 hours).
First virtual operator to arrive in Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
In spite of this, there is something missing - a virtual operator that would force the classic operators to reduce their prices.
It may be missing for a long time.
The fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe has been written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This has also been confirmed by Czech Telecommunications Bureau, which called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher than in the rest of the Union.
Following recent European Commission steps in the field of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation may occur - text messages for some Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that Czech prices remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there are no competitors who would really like to enter the battle.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks here and over 100% coverage.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, believe that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often followed by the Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Bureau (CTB) Pavel Dvořák, who has repeatedly claimed that there is no room for another operator in Czechia.
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network no longer has much chance (for example, it would be very difficult to find frequencies).
Then there is one more opportunity - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the introduction of virtual operators on the mobile market that caused the significant lowering of prices, to which even the classic operators had to respond.
In addition, even before the entry of aggressive competitors such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, similar voices could be heard.
It has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly successful.
However, we do not have to go far to find examples.
In February this year, we informed you of the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
The operator took only half a year to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator.
The same financial group Penta, which owns, among others, U:fon, stands behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they require many fewer customers than a classic operator does.
They do not carry the relatively high costs of building, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
This way, virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer inexpensive calls and text messages, which is often balanced by a more limited offer of services.
The way Tesco Mobile in Great Britain can offer text messaging for at least fifty percent less than its competitors.
The example of Mobilking in Poland shows that it can be a good move and a good bet on a novel target group.
This operator is specifically oriented to men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - the operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in Poland could catch on here.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický does not believe this:
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the perspective of the offer of services.
No chance in Czech Republic, say mobile operators
It seems to be almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czechia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We have been discussing the expanding of this successful project, but Czech negotiations look very hopeful.
More likely, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in the region, according to Jana Studničková, speaker for the Penta financial group in a phone interview for Mobil.cz.
The female representative also confirmed that current mobile operators in Czechia are not inclined towards this idea.
However, they are trying to do everything they can to prevent any potential competitor.
The GTS Novera group has been without a secret about its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator, and in this way it would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the area of corporate clients.
"We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hardwire telecommunication services, but also mobile ones.
The sooner, the better.
We have held repeated negotiations on this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
They have already made progress in the negotiations with some of them, according to the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe there are better times ahead.
The following unofficial information looks like we can expect the first virtual operator in the end of this year.
In the meantime, its creation is accompanied by a wall of silence.
At this time, we do not think that there is a space for a full-fledged virtual operator.
Compared to other markets, Czech market is very specific.
No subject has been approached with a complex and serious project in this area, according to Vlastimil Sršeň from the Public Relations department of Telefonica 02 in a statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specific nature of Czech market.
In a rare shared opinion with O2, T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová added: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous business project that we can build on.
Then she added: "No virtual operator is likely to appear in T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
This moment, to be talking about such a short timeframe, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table.
Vodafone is focusing more on fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license.
Regarding this, Mr. Čepický said: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, mainly in the area of costs and infrastructure.
From the perspective of customers, we consider this to be the most beneficial.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a shared network for fast mobile Internet.
Responsible authorities - buddy-buddy with operators
The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would lead to increased competition, which would lead to lower prices and consequently to decrease their profits.
Why do we make this easy for such a competitor?
The tug of war around the creation of U:fon attests to the fact that when something is important to the operators, they can pull for the same team.
The most important pressure on the Czech Telecommunication Office was during the time of the creation of U:fon by T-Mobile.
Information available on the Czech Telecommunication Office's website attests to this.
It is now a suitable argument for U:fon to not allow the access of the virtual operator.
Regarding that matter, Martina Kemrová pointed out: “The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently amplified by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
The character of the Czech Republic mobile market is clearly evidenced that the introduction of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its services.
The lack of interest by the Czech regulatory bodies is almost astonishing.
This means not only the attitude of the CTO, which unfortunately in Czechia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - has no authority to intervene in economic competition.
This authority belongs to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OPC) exclusively.
This Office has assumed its normal position on this whole issue.
The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has ever been signed, because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators.
A statement formulated in such a way by representatives of the operators probably will not surprise anybody.
From the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one abuses his/her position on the market, it is more than serious.
The more so when Kristián Chalupa added: "In other countries, where virtual operators commonly function, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services.
The pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the OPC.
In fact, the most shocking element of the whole case is the almost fluid harmony between the three mobile operators that is implicit in their reactions.
The question as to whether this is really a coincidence arises entirely by itself.
Likewise, the same price of gasoline at gas stations is probably a result of coincidence and competitive battle.
The Office did not find any signs of actions violating the competition rules, and thus has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of them have a dominant position, and therefore no of them have the corresponding responsibility for their actions on the market.
The telecommunications regulator is likely to also lack the instruments to open the mobile market for the virtual operators.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the disputed points.
The relevant markets are analyzed by CTO, according to which telecommunications are, from the perspective of competition, the only market.
On such a market, no Czech operators then have a dominant position.
The legal experts offer a different perspective - to create a virtual operator, it must be allowed by the network operator.
The mobile operator - entirely logically - has a monopoly on its network.
In a certain segment it must be dominant.
If we do not consider this argument, for the OPC it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proceeding in strikingly similar manner.
However, complaints from a series of interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) indicate that they are encountering similar difficulties in negotiating with all the operators.
Holding the responsibility on the CTO is a common trick in telecoms, where the OPC cannot have any involvement with the whole matter.
We have already experienced it in several similar cases.
The CTO's authority to the area of competition in the recently approved amendment to the Telecommunications Act was unable to establish the extension of his authority to the area of telecommunications competition, although many experts had expected that this would improve the situation.
The OPC representatives must know this very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
It can be done when nobody is looking.
The functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are already several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
This is a company that publishes their own price lists for mobile telephone services, only partially public.
This is usually a company dealing with multilevel marketing.
Examples include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected individuals.
The trick lies in the fact that, in relation to the operator, the company acts like a classic company client who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant client, it then gets special price offers (and other types of offers).
The problem is that all Czech mobile operators do not allow advance sales.
If the cases you are talking about occur, this could be a violation of the contract conditions, which we would investigate and result in the end of our cooperation with the given company.
It is highly unlikely that such activities would not be reported to the responsible people from the mobile operators.
This could be a question of thousands of customers, especially in the three mentioned above.
The same time, no operator is opposed to such a procedure.
They make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not present any threat to them through their own official marketing.
According to Mr. Čepický, the law allows such speculation, but only a small percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
Then, they must accept that the SIM card in their telephone is not registered under their name, and thus they cannot use all its features like regular mobile operators can.
This is precisely what should seem at least strange to the CTO.
In addition, another question for the OPC is asked.
If the mobile operators are looking other way about this procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the OPC has a considerable power to uncover such activities, and if it does not wish to, it must not be satisfied with operators' claims that they have no knowledge about such activities and that they have no trading conditions to prohibit it.
When we will not be the most expensive
The introduction of virtual operators into the mobile market was caused by a significant drop in the prices of services.
The same time, classical operators have tried to prevent the creation of virtual operators in practically all countries where they have been created.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a small, too saturated market, problems with quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, regulatory bodies, which supported the interests of mobile operators, intervened at that time.
Then through formal measures or informal pressure, they created the first virtual operator, and others followed its footsteps.
The Czech regulatory bodies have been sliding the whole case back and forth like hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that lack of clarity in competencies suits them well.
However, do not throw in the towel.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and a virtual operator appears soon, the Czech mobile market might be set up again.
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for OPC to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
New Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Select the best one.
Read four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my Country) on the occasion of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - versions with male or female solo vocals, a choral version and an instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka performed.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the server iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful national anthems.
The Czech Radio earlier told Czech Radio that he intentionally selected young, representative voices that were striking and popular for the solo variants.
Since the beginning, with both them and also with the Chorus, I tried to make sure that they had clear articulation, so that the text could be understood well, and that they were in harmony.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj (Where is my Country) was first heard in 1834 on the stage of the Estates Theater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetan Tyl with music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it as their own.
The first stanza of the song became natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of seven state symbols following the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new hymn" sounds
Prague City Mass Transport to operate on chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written into the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when first travellers board the metro, trams and buses with an electronic coupon in their pockets.
The roughly one hundred thousand people with their own Opencard at this time can get this coupon.
Travellers can buy a 30-day, 90-day and year-long coupon (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and added it to their chip card at the info centres and branches of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
In the morning, coupons are also available over the Internet on the website of the Transport Company, www.dpp.cz.
By afternoon, more than four hundred customers have used the service.
The beginning users of Internet shopping will forget about the vending windows in metro stations, where up to now they have had to often stand in long lines for paper tickets.
The coupon can be purchased over the Internet and it will be added to the Opencard at one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
The counter is available for travellers with trained staff who will help them with Internet purchases and will also add the purchased coupon to their card.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to add the electronic coupons to the Opencard at the self-service machines which have been set up in several vestibules of the metro.
What do self-service machines look like?
The red ones are like ticket validation machines, and travellers may have already seen them in metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
Currently there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them.
Coupon check by self-service machine instead of driver
The basic steps to use the self-service machines are simple.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card, and the pre-paid card automatically adds to it.
The electronic coupons are now valid not only in the capital city but also in its surroundings.
The trains and buses numbered 300 to 499 are mainly used by inhabitants of Central Bohemian towns to travel to the capital city.
Passengers in trains included in Prague Integrated Transport are equipped with card reader, with the help of which they can check the time and zone validity of the tickets.
The urban buses have card reader built into the cash register next to the driver's seat.
Upon boarding, it is therefore necessary to not only show the chip card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard on the designated spot on the side of the cash register.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons recorded.
When the traveller needs to confirm the validity of the coupons, there is no easy way to request this information from the driver.
Travelers who do not use urban buses, and will not remember when the validity of a coupon ends, can head for the self-service machines where the coupons are added to the card.
Here the information on the validity of their documents will appear on the machine's screen.
Sudetenlands wanted US referendum
Sudeten Germans requested that Šumava region be incorporated into the United States in 1945.
This is implicit in a letter kept in the South Bohemia Research Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we wish to live under the patronage of the United States.
The Sudeten Germans believed to have addressed the USA with a similar wish.
This is arising from a letter which was kept in a private archive and now is kept in the South Bohemia Research Library.
In the letter, Germans from Český Krumlov request that the American president not allow the return of the "Šumava region" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
'We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be fully certain of the words that American troops are entering German territory not as occupation and enemies, but as liberators' is what is written in the letter, signed by "People who are not indifferent to the future of Šumava'.
Since the annexation by Czechoslovakia only gives Sudeten Germans hope for - knowing Czech national character - brutality, disregard, lack of understanding and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over Šumava forever.
Without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people you would award this territory to a state foreign to us, which suppresses and oppresses minorities and which has nothing, absolutely nothing, to the victory of the Allied States.
The reason why the authors cannot sign their names was the fear of revenge by the Czech occupations.
If the USA president believes that the Šumava Germans are being persuaded to be part of the USA, it would be enough to organize a referendum in Šumava region on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the USA or live under the United States supervision.
The letter may sound a bit naive, given the current knowledge of post-war history, but some reports suggest it appropriately sketches the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
The Czech Germans had to at least expect that their displacement from the country would be discussed, but almost no of them believed it.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate some type of autonomy for the Sudetenlands.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Republic, also confirms this.
As a German from Czech Republic, he was sent to the navy in the Baltic Sea during the war.
Then he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, tens of Czech Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
They believed that when they return home Czech would be invaluable, Chalupa said.
According to him, no German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war were displaced from the republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don’t think - you pay!
Emotsion campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action aimed at road safety in Czech history.
The emotional media campaign is also one way to characterize the emotive media campaign that the Ministry of Transportation plans to launch on Wednesday.
The Office of Minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that it will prevent drivers from driving dangerously.
The campaign will be broadcast on television, on radio, in cinemas, on Internet, but also on flyers.
It should prevent drivers from speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol.
Also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before they start driving.
Above all, it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, and last but not least professional drivers.
What is appearing in the spots?
Human stories that attack the emotions.
The whole campaign is bloody.
You don’t think - you pay!
The words you don't think are written in capital letters on a license plate.
The words "you pay" are in a blood pool.
This is a symbol of carelessness in the person’s life.
The spots will "haunt" the viewers until 2010.
The ministry found inspiration in similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to find pictures with dramatic images of accident victims.
It hopes that the accident rate and number of deaths on Czech roads will decrease.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"Drivers are influenced by the sugar and whip system.
The sugar for them is, for example, when they run a red light, they save time.
The whip is the threat of a fine or accident.
The driver must be repeatedly reminded of risk, says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist from Na Homolce Hospital.
The reason for such information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising is that the psychologist believes.
Less effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the driver's attention to the danger.
When a static table warning against danger is installed, it will likely soon blend into the surroundings and the drivers will not care about it.
Olmert would return nearly all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The Provisional Israeli government's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed his opinion in favor of the return of practically all occupational territories in 1967, including Transjordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and with Syria.
The interview was published by the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Monday.
According to the newspaper, the agreement with the Palestinians will mean that they will have to return nearly all of the (occupied) territories, if not all of them.
However, we will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give a similar percentage of Israeli territory to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace if we do not do that.
The Holocaust scholar believed that the possible restitution would also include East Jerusalem.
Everyone who wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his or her legs, will have to give up Jerusalem.
The Prime Minister says it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Temple Mount, a sacred and historic place, which lies inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work.
Golan Heights
Also, Olmert supported the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which is a vital condition for entering into a peace agreement with Syria.
It would also require a certain effort from Damascus.
However, I am not proposing to agree on peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
The Syrians know what they will have to give up to gain the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (Shi-ite movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up their ongoing support to the terrorism of (Shi-ite movement) Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq.
Questions after accident: Are stewards in bus legal?
Law does not know them, walking in coach bus not permitted
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency in Padua, Italy, the question has appeared as to whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion.
If we want to strictly and formally follow the law, the activities of the steward are in conflict with the Traffic Law.
The accident, which killed a two-year-old stewardess last week, was believed to have been caused by the driver of the truck that crossed into the path of the bus.
The girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the vehicle, even though there are two more seats reserved for her.
The bus can crash or brake sharply even when the steward is handing out coffee or newspapers.
The question of whether the bus is equipped with standing room in accordance with its registration plays a role.
If this is not approved in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The Student Agency coach buses do not have standing room, which the head of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed for Aktuálně.cz.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and initially they did not allow the movement of the passengers.
Then they revoked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat.
The law does not know the steward.
There is no straightforward legal interpretation of the steward - no legal acts deal with this role.
However, no legal acts prohibit transporters from providing services.
The Traffic Law only knows the term vehicle conductor; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person.
The Head of the Department of Motor Vehicle Operation of the Ministry of Transportation, Josef Pokorný, on the contrary, believes that the law is sufficiently developed.
"It depends on whether the bus has standing room permitted in its certification.
It is all there is to it, he says.
Buses are classified into the categories of city bus, where there is standing room and limited speed, inter-city buses with standing room and higher maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like in airplane, says expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert on traffic safety for the National Strategy for Traffic Safety (BESIP), does not see any essential problem in the movement of stewards on buses.
"While a smooth ride, there is no risk of danger, the situation can be compared to airplanes.
Even there it is uncertain when turbulence occurs and the stewardess can hit her head.
"However, if the bus brake sharply, physics is valid.
Like in a city bus or tram.
The transport provider must deal with the safety of the stewards through internal regulations, and he also believes that legally this issue is unresolved.
Jančura willing to discontinue services
Student Agency is the only bus transport provider to offer the steward service.
It employs about two hundred people.
After the accident, the head does not consider their job as risky.
"But once I get an impression that the stewards' job is risky, I will discontinue them.
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers when boarding.
It would also save costs," he says.
Alexej Litvin, head of Asiana, which operates a fraction of the bus lines that SA does, explained the absence of stewards in his buses as safety interests.
We do not have stewardesses, we have been against it since the very start.
The accident will end in a fatal accident, he told Týden.cz a year ago.
The huge tragedy occurred.
The young stewardess from Pilsen area, who had worked for two years, died in an accident on the bus line to Naples.
The Slovenian tractor trailer truck likely left the emergency lane without signalling and blocked the path of the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it by using a sharp manoeuvre, but the front right part of the bus struck it.
Jančura rejects the claim that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest have been sold out.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach buses, they are blocked."
The company plans to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court verdict to compensate the girl's family, but it expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
Adaptation of law?
Far away
The adaptation of the law, which has been worked on for over a year, could bring about the specification of the movement of stewards on board the buses.
"But no concrete conclusion has been reached.
The focus is on buses, but more on the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving.
The Transportation Ministry does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any way.
Duesseldorf Hopes for Frankfurt
In a letter from WestLB board of directors to its employees, grand talk is not short supply.
Combination of the Duesseldorf institution with Frankfurt's Deka Bank, the notice made public on Monday claims, could create a major capital-market institution of the Sparkassen Finanzgruppe.
WestLB would contribute to the deal a `bloc of expertise' with sustained earning power, it says.
The letter suggests that such a jointer might provide the pivotal impulse for further concentration in the area of the German state banks, the Landesbanken.
It sounds like when a board of directors wants to display being on top of things in difficult times.
The flagship WestLB is still exposed to tremendous pressure, after all.
The EU Commission has not only given warnings to North Rhine-Westphalia that there was urgent need for a solution.
The talks of some sort of joint venture between Deka Bank, which savings bank clients are familiar with due to its investment fund, and WestLB have been making rounds for some time now - even in Frankfurt.
Following the report on the first two quarters in late August, Deka Bank head Franz Waas said a fusion between the Institute on Mainzer Landstrasse and a Landesbank, such as Hesse and Thuringia's Helaba or WestLB, was unnecessarily attractive to him.
The Management Board of Deka, which is owned in equal parts by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has asked the board of directors to begin talks with WestLB on joint business ventures.
The possible subject is the capital market business, or parts of it.
The negotiations have only begun, as sources in the financial community point out.
The first time the name Deka Bank - with its staff of 3000 - appears in the context of savings banks consolidation.
In 2003, a merger of Deka Bank with Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba seemed to be possible.
Then the third marriage ended.
The plans appeared public, and the Hessian state government spoke out against the participation of Helaba.
The two remaining institutions also failed to agree.
Instead, Rhineland-Palatinate Landesbank was acquired by Stuttgart's Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
The deliberations on a joint venture between Deka Bank and Landesbanken have continued to rear their head.
Most recently, Guenther Merl, chairman of the board at Helaba, rejected proposals for a merger with his institution.
This aside, there seems to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the public sector institutions is essential.
First up, now that the state elections in Bavaria have been over, a joint venture between BayernLB and the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank may have become more likely.
For Helaba, that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for more merger increases, it will by degrees be running out of potential partners.
In South, it would be a junior partner, but it has already survived the financial crisis much better than the institutions in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was squashed early this year by the Savings Bank Association of Hesse and Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba.
Remains only NordLB.
The geostrategic considerations are only one side of the picture.
On the other hand, the question of how far the institutions' different business models are compatible with one.
In June, Merl said that the key issue of finding an appropriate business model to ensure sustainability of the Landesbanken was not yet resolved by the German Savings Bank Association.
The WestLB might also split up, but, of course, that is not a solution for WestLB.
The letter from its board of directors, accordingly, voices the manifest desire for a `comprehensive solution.'
However, how this is reconcilable with a jointer between WestLB and Deka Bank remains to be seen.
Second Weekend at Wiesn is known as Italian Weekend.
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth time.
This time he brought along his girlfriend Elena, and that changes everything, he says.
Behind them, next to a five-litre keg of Kaiser beer, stands a massively built bearded man who is proving to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest tourists how deep the sound his throat can produce.
Elena first slaps Luca, then kisses him.
The brothers came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, a parking lot for buses next to Puorta Nuova, four buses will depart at 11:45 tonight, 'destination Monaco, birra festival.' Estimated time of arrival: 6:30 AM.
Three buses are reserved for Italians mainly, one is exclusively for Brazil.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans are already singing next to their flag. They were celebrating last night already.
And very loudly, too, says Marco Guarda - too loudly for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fake fur lining and glasses with broad silver ears, runs the buses.
The boys have been making trips to the Oktoberfest for five years now, three of them this year alone.
The travel goes at night, spend the day at the ‘Wiesn’ and return home at 10:30 PM.
Sleeping over night only generates unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip is 75 Euros, including a welcome round of Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance, and Marco’s German-language guide.
The buses head out into the night, on the autostrada leading to `Brennero.'
There is no beer to be had yet.
Soon all is quiet in the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
As they should be - they will need their strength.
The buses stop in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where a huge number of Italian buses are making their final stop on the Autobahn 8, right before Munich.
The group finally arrives, as planned, at half past six in the morning at a parking lot near Theresienwiese, about 50 buses from all over Europe are already there.
They meet and Marco address them to give them the marching orders.
First up: Put on yellow caps.
On the left side they say `Oktoberfest' in Gothic type, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency, "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: When the doors of the beer tent open, you have to run!' Marco shouts into the morning.
Run!' Walk and carry the seats in the rear part of the tent.
'Not in the front, or else we will block the entry. And not all yellow hats at the same table - spread out in the room!'
It is 8.25 Euros per measure, Marco screams.
And do not forget to tip.
`Show security people how we act!
As soon as you abandon your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `Come back here tonight at 10:30 sharp!' Understood?
And off to the ‘Wiesn’ they go.
One of them is marking the way by tying yellow caps to trees, signs and even to campaign posters of a political party that is popular in Bavaria.
They want to be prepared for the retreat.
It is the second weekend at the Wiesn, known as the Italian Weekend.
The figures are not exact, but estimates are that around 50,000 visitors will descend on the beer tents - ten percent of all visitors on this weekend are reported to have visited Italy specifically for this purpose.
Munich police are strengthened by seven policemen from South Tyrol, and Italian volunteers are providing support to the Austrian Red Cross, according to whose statistics on nationals Italians lead the medical attention field with about 200 cases, with Austrians (about 80 cases) and British (about 60 cases) leading the field.
Italians are particularly fond of the ‘Hofbräu’ tent.
No Sleep for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The recently appointed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck stressed that the banking system in Germany was relatively stable.
The politician used the term relatively, further emphasising that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis.
Because that's what happened this weekend.
The real estate bank Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from Munich, which is listed in the DAX stock index, is receiving billions of loans from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
The individual close to the proceedings told Reuters on Monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion Euros total.
Hypo Real Estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends using, they said.
The money was coming from private and public banks, they added.
The news is followed by losses at subsidiary Depfa.
The government-funded bank had refinanced long-term projects it was financing on very short notice - which, due to mistrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shed by 95 percent to 2.37 Euros, with the capital resource quota increasing from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The ongoing and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to nil compared to the same period in the previous year, while earnings from write-ups on demand and specific bonds and from the liquidation of accruals from credit transactions had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million Euros.
The decline in earnings remained moderately 16 percent only thanks to higher earnings through refunds from downstream accounting costs from restructuring the former Depfa Group, as well from interest refunds from agency for group companies.
After going private in 1990, the former government-funded bank initially incurred speculation losses through commercial real-estate credits, which were then outsourced to Aareal Bank.
Because earnings from classical government-funded funding were low, Depfa diversified internationally, increasingly engaging in infrastructure projects and in joint ventures between private investors and the government (Public-Private Partnership, PPP).
The group is expected to induce write-offs according to the subsidiary's value that will have a significant, material effect on its profit and loss statement, it said.
As a matter of fact, the dividend has been omitted.
It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a significant financer of government and infrastructure.
Because it does not have client deposits, it is more dependent on refinancing at the interbank market than other banks.
With the collapse of American investment bank Lehman Brothers, the extension of loans among banks has largely dried out, because banks are spending their assets.
The Debfa’s loan portfolio - about 50 billion Euros - requires short-term capital for refinancing.
The credit covers the group's future financing requirements, shielding the corporation from the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international financial markets.
Other sources say that thanks to the credit, refinancing is covered until late 2009.
HRE board member Georg Funke believes that in the near future the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the financial markets again.
The Deutsche Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) are now considering Hypo Real Estate Group's marketability to be secured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors are expected to be right.
The dynamics and unpredictability of the crisis could remain uncertain.
It is not unthinkable that not all of the financing will be needed.
The opposite cannot be discounted either, however.
After the bank was reportedly close to insolvent late Sunday night, even a temporary bailout is unable to easing people's minds.
The price per share is dropping by 75 percent to 3.30 Euros.
Bond prices are holding reasonably well, meanwhile.
Senior debts are hardly moving, junior bonds are significantly dropping.
This mainly applies to bonds of former subsidiary Wuerttemberg Hypo and, understandably, to repayment periods beyond 2009.
The financial crisis, as well as the bank's own homemade crisis caused by the acquiring of Depfa, however, their recoverability is dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as central banks, governments and less stricken corporate banks are still willing to support the system, bond settlement deadlines can be met.
Alternatively, that which nobody could hope for yet right now occurs, and the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
The probability of a bordering on certainty has now become a valid hope.
This may cause some sleepless nights for long-term creditors, as they ponder whether or not to abandon their exposure.
Short-term investors may at least use the line drawn as a opportunity to draft a loss carry-forward for the capital gains compensation tax payments of years to come.
Sylvana and the Bento Box Secrets
The girls start laughing: The German girl is totally kawaii!
What this means?
Sylvana is familiar with the term from reading manga - in her new exchange log she tells about Japan.
First day at school in Japan.
I was so excited.
The way to school alone gave me jitters.
I live in the edge of Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and the train ride to Tachibana High School is 40 minutes.
I had to find the way on my own, and luckily I did not get lost.
The start of the class is not organized as strictly as back home in Lower Saxony.
Early in the morning students start trickling in at eight o'clock, until a short conference with the teacher, the ‘home room,’ starts at 8:40.
After class, I started to introduce myself.
I am not someone who likes to talk in front of people, mind you, even in a class of 40.
Because I was still not in school, I was dressed in one of my host mother's old skirts, along with a blouse, blue stockings and black leather shoes.
In this manner I stood before the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and my birthday is a week from now.
The moment I remembered, I was very happy that I have been learning the language for two years now.
The 31 girls in class were all whispering and giggle among themselves and waving at me.
I already knew it from my manga.
It is part of the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls and means `cute,' `sweet.'
Then I scurried to my seat.
The girl beside me was smiling brightly. She thought it was an honor that the exchange student should be seated next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty uneventful, but when the bell ring, they all practically crowded me.
The guys were talking all along and giggle and bombard me with one question after another, even though Japanese English is really hard to understand.
Then, during the break, everyone got out of their bentos.
My host mother prepared such a lunch box for me, too - something different than the bleak German lunch break sandwiches.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad made from cucumber and algae, fruit and some meat in a tofu coat.
Most of the time I have no clue what I am eating here in Japan.
The stuff looks weird and has a completely novel taste.
I can say this: It is all delicious.
The only salty plums in oil are those. They are very tasty.
At Japanese schools, bentos are not only lunch.
Occasionally a girl gives a homemade bento that she has fixed in a particularly fancy way to a boy, in order to get to know him better during lunch break.
I read that in my manga.
I am looking forward to finding out if that is happening here too.
Why Japan, of all places?, my girlfriends asked me.
And I always told them:
Because it happens to fascinate me.'
All in all, manga have been my favorite reading material for years.
Then, to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I started to learn a little Japanese.
It was no-brainer that I would have to come here eventually.
Because I also have a keen interest in tradition, manners and customs.
The following are considered very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends, but on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
The chaos is so well organized, I have not been lost yet, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen.
Rats have Feelings, too.
When in danger, rats or rodents will run away. Does it mean they feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have thoughts.
If they act the same way we do, how can it be determined if they also experience the same feelings?
The Internet magazine Edge has been running pieces by famous scientists for years.
In a series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a selection of responses to the question, `What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?'
Animals have feelings, as well as other modes of awareness, but we have not yet proven that they have awareness.
Then we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
As we turn to other species and ask questions about feelings or awareness in general, we are entering difficult terrain, because the hardware is not compatible.
When a rat is in danger, it plays possum, runs away or attacks.
Humans act similarly, leading some scientists to conclude that the subjective experience is similar.
I do not believe that.
There are two aspects of our brain structure that make it difficult to project our subjective experience on animals.
The most common circuits involved in human awareness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short term memory and executive and control functions).
This broad region is more advanced in humans than it is in other primates, and seems to be entirely missing in other creatures.
The human awareness based on the prefrontal cortex is probably different from other primates.
The second distinction is likely to be in human linguistic nature: Because such a large part of human experience is linked to language, it is often believed that human awareness depends on it.
In such cases, animals can be excluded.
If awareness was not dependent on language, it would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness.
It is why it is so difficult to determine what animal awareness may be.
If you have something that is internal and subjective, cannot be measured nor analyzed according to our own experience, then its study requires significant challenges.
The explanation has mostly been focused on conscious awareness, but aside from that, there is another important aspect of awareness that is more scientifically accessible.
Human awareness processes can be studied regardless of their content, and that is exactly what is happening in the study of short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
This approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, is concerned with the neural correlates of awareness rather than the causal mechanisms, which may or may not be identical.
This approach also highlights the role of the prefrontal cortex for generation of the visualization.
What does this mean for feelings now?
Remember that an emotional system like fear is triggered in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call fear, therefore, is the mental state we are in when the activity of the brain defense system (or its effects such as physical reactions) is processed through virtual memory.
The emotional aspect of feelings is closely linked to those regions of the cortex that are unique to primates, and humans in particular.
In combination with the linguistic nature, the result is delicate emotions, because through words and grammar we can differentiate between states and categorize them, in order to project them to others as well.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings are usually generated from more primitive activities in the cortext and brainstem involved with bodily sensations.
Since this network has not changed in human evolution, they say, it may be a cause of cross-species sensations.
In theory, I cannot agree with that, but I consider it improvable.
However, Pankseep argues that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it in both cases.
A roach's response to danger is flight. Does it experience fear?
As far as I am concerned, a mere similarity of actions is not sufficient evidence for an identity of experiences.
The neural comparison is helpful, granted: Rats and humans have similar brainstems, whereas rodents do not even have brains.
What is the brainstem responsible for emotions?
If it can be proven for humans - how would one want to prove it for rats?
I believe rats and other mammals - maybe even rodents (who knows?) - have emotions.
It is not a proof.
Because their emotional sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (since human awareness is based on specific circuits and on language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
There is a promise of results on the nerve level here, if measured in rats and humans.
Like I do not study language and awareness in rats, I do not study their emotions, given that I do not even know if they exist.
The latter may be short-sighted, but I prefer to make progress, rather than keep hitting a wall.
I just happen to be a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Reprieve for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Ivan Vasik said that preparations would soon be transferred to the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
UEFA's decision is a display of trust in Ukraine and its ability to host the Eurocup together with Poland,' Vasyunik said.
This is no amnesty for our country.
'Work has only begun, and much still to be done in both countries.
The two host hosts are behind on the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Even a reduction of the number of Euro stadiums from eight to six is possible.
`We cannot waste any more time.
'We have to continue at a high speed now,' said Grigoriy Surkis, president of the Ukrainian soccer association.
UEFA will keep us constantly in touch.'
The more radical measure was taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was assembled at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslav Drzewiecki.
The serious danger that the PZPN cannot act according to the rules, Drzewiecki told PAP.
'We have reassured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparedness for the Euro 2012 will not suffer because of this.'
In the past season, several major-league teams were convicted of manipulation and sentenced to forced relegation. Finally, even the start of the season was postponed shortly.
Indignant Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, talked about personal issues in an interview - and now she is in trouble with her ex:
The latter is fuming at her - and strikes back.
Early marital war between former wife Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after divorcing, the two Hollywood actors are now involved in an unusual - and public - argument.
In an interview with US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan opened up about the reasons for the failure of the marriage:
The truth was only known after the divorce, she said.
The occasion for her candor was the promotion of her new film The Women, which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to being portrayed as a cheating husband was unequivocal: It was 'outrageous' to meet the threat of being portrayed as a cheating husband, when she repeatedly rehashes and revises the history of our relationship.'
It was also regrettable that their common 16-year-old son Jack was again publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals of divorce for any child,' he said.
While Ryan has been living on her own since the divorce, Quaid recently married and recently became the father of twins.
The conclusion of his comments was a sideswipe.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing well. '
Flight and Hotel Rates drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and rooms in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flight rates have fallen by as much as 50%, a current survey says.
Flights and hotel rooms have fallen again, according to a survey by travel and financial services provider American Express.
Following a significant increase in the first quarter, the company found that after an increase in first quarter, rates continued to drop.
After years of increasing rates in the hotel market, rooms have already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, rates in 41 out of 48 analyzed European cities were still increasing by an average 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
April to June, rates have already declined by 3.6 percent compared to the previous year.
The trend was most visible in Paris and Rome, where travelers paid between 30 and 37 percent less than last year.
American Express believes the dollar is the reason for this, as it results in a decrease in travel desire among American tourists.
Financial centers like Frankfurt and London were hit harder by the dropping hotel rates than industry locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger, it says.
With an increase of 26.3 percent, hotel rates in Norway are holding the record for Europe.
Flight rates were still trending up in the first quarter.
The cost of kerosene in economy-class flights was 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-haul flights went up by as much as 29.2 percent.
In April to June, economy-class flight rates declined by an average 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, while business- and first-class flights were much less noticeable.
In Germany, rates have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries.
From January to March, rates had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they drop by 23.6 percent.
The rates of domestic German flights have fallen even, a survey says.
On the other hand, the sudden drop in rates was the result of slowing economic growth, the company says.
Demand was declining in many segments of the air travel market, it says.
The other side of the competition was increase through the Open Skies Agreement, which regulates air travel between the US and Europe.
The main signs of increasing tension are the cancellation of unprofitable routes at airlines, it says, and the high number of airlines filing for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, it says.
Hamburg SV 1, Borussia Moenchengladbach 0
With one goal and simple measures, Hamburg SV takes the top position.
At Dortmund, Luhukay remains unable to find a working team.
By Kristy Klein. Enlarge.
The Gladbach player joined late and missed, lifting the ball to the crossbar.
The message was concisely phrased and left his throat convincingly.
The only thing he knew was that he was right.
'We need second goal,' Hermann Rieger shouted in the hallway at Hamburg Arena.
The half-time break was over and most people had returned to their seats.
Rieger was HSV's physiotherapist for almost three decades.
Then his petition was heard by the supreme powers.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his finger in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Head Coach, Martin Jol.
The latter's order is likely to have been similar: Get me goal number two!
It was never executed.
'Not everything was fun to look at today,' Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wished for more relaxation.
HSV has to thank Mladen Petric for the 1-0 (1-0) with his header (11th); and that a very weak Gladbach team failed to hit the weak Hamburg team where it hurts.
The dirty victory was Martin Jol's assessment.
This Monday, Hamburg SV turns 121 years old.
Fans began celebrating Saturday evening - themselves, the blue sky above the Arena and the instant chart on the video screen showing their club as the best in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
'We know where to file this one,' said Marcell Jansen.
The intermediate report says more about unpredictability of the Liga than about his HSV's dominance.
The team and its belatedly signed new members - Brazils Neves and Silva, goal-getter Petric, goal-keeper Petric and Jansen - are slowly finding their form, but they are still not shining brightly.
'We need more style and more dribbling,' Jol asked.
After Voting Failure
Fear is making rounds on Wall Street.
Initial reports of the bailout failure at one point resulted in the Dow Jones dropping by 700 points.
It was the biggest one-day point drop in its history.
After the recovery, the Dow Jones started to recover.
Around 8:30 PM the world's most important market indicator listed with 10,579 points, with a significant negative five percent.
The technology stock exchange Nasdaq was at 1548 points, with a further seven percent decline.
In the Dow, the biggest losses were suffered by American Express, which dropped by 14 percent, and by the Bank of America, which lost around twelve percent.
There were no increases for any shares.
The share of the bank Goldman Sachs declined by about ten percent.
Large scale investor Warren Buffet had acquired the company only a few days ago.
The bailout included the provision of funds for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage certificates.
The sum is not disbursed at one go, but increasingly.
In turn, the United States was to acquire stock purchase warrants from the finance companies that could be discharged once share prices were appropriate, in order to reduce the burden on the National Treasury.
Emerging Stock Markets in Europe and the US in Downward Spiral
The billion dollar aids for banks in Europe and the US are not easing investor's doubts.
The shares of the German major bank Hypo Real Estate are declining and dragging the DAX.
The US index Dow Jones is declining despite the United States' planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular share losses at Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German Stock Index (DAX) into a deep loss.
The Munich-based real estate financer declined by three fourths at one point, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The DAX slipped significantly below the important psychological 6,000-point marker and listed at 5,839 points, with a negative percentage of 3.7 percent.
Financial markets were brought to the knees all over the world.
New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Financial investors feared that the US government's 700 billion dollar bailout might not suffice to kickstart the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of trading, dropping to 10,809.25 points.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan. The Senate could follow on October 1st.
The rest of European banks knew only one direction: In London the FTSE index initially dropped by 3.2 percent, in Paris the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the leading Japanese index Nikkei slipped by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index declined by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
Corporate bank Sal. Oppenheim applied for the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism corporation also announced that its shares in Thomas Cook would not be sold.
Dark Matter Affects Space Probes
The mysterious phenomenon has kept researchers stumped for years: Dark matter is affecting the speed of space probes during swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses probe has been flying through space.
Because of freezing fuel lines, it is now threatening to shut down.
The Mysterious Swing-By Anomaly has been causing confusion for years - the Swing-By Anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight maneuver during which space probes gain additional acceleration in the gravitational field of a spherical body, such as Earth.
It enables the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
The question that researchers have been asking for for years is this: The objects in flight are not acting exactly as we have come to expect according to the venerable law of gravitation.
However, there are irregularities in their speed.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
To date, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They have called it Swing-By Anomaly.
The experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and is trying to explain the Swing-By Anomaly by using dark matter that astronomers discovered in the universe.
The anomalies may be dark matter very close to Earth that may cause the anomalies.
Space researchers have only been aware of dark matter for about ten years.
Evidently, it emits a gravitational force that has a measurable effect on other bodies.
The dark matter itself is completely invisible, meaning that it does not send nor emit any electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light in particular.
The scientists' calculations, dark matter represents about one fifth of all matter in the universe.
Abducted Tourists in Egypt Released
After being held for ten days, the abducted tourists have been released, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The abductors from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million Euros.
In a shootout following the rescue, six of their captors were reportedly killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been abducted.
Discussions about a ransom are reportedly underway.
Time again, Germans become in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
The World Online report highlights most notable cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara have apparently been freed.
Reports by Egyptian state television, Arabian TV channel al Arabiya and Italian media are in accordance with that.
The Italian TV channel Sky TG 24 confirmed the release: ‘Our fellow citizens and other prisoners have been freed.
Currently we are checking their health,' Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and eight Egyptian travellers were safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition were already on their way to Cairo, it said.
The circumstances of the shootout before the release are unclear: According to an Egyptian security agent, the captors were ready to end the abduction when the Sudanese army suddenly killed six of the captors.
The problem was resolved.
The agent said.
The prisoners were only being given, when suddenly the surprise occurred.
The Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the abductors and taken two as prisoners in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The abductors asked for a ransom of six million Euros from Germany, and the money was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the prisoners.
According to a German negotiator, the daily newspaper `El Masri El Jom' reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
The report says that the abductors planned to release the women after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held captive until the abductors secured an escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Stepfather abuse "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman to kill herself, a court has told.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithian, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
Truro Crown Court heard he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession note:
The court heard that Ms Randle died at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
Then she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts, while her mother was out working at a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in 1980, and he returned to Cornwall.
Then his stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
The court heard that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse that was being inflicted on her twice-weekly.
By 2006, Attorney Ramsey Quaife told the court, Mrs Randle, who was a keen surfer and cyclist, was "emotionally dead" and had given up life.
When she died in April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randon, found her dead at her flat in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself through suffocation using a plastic bag.
The father of Mr Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended with: "I used to tie her up and blindfold her.
"I did not sexually assault her.
I feel responsible for her death.
The judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and your victim must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking her own life.
However, more stark, is that if she did not do so, it is very doubtful that matters would have ended in court.
The lawyer added: "I note the effect Stephanie's father and mother have on her daughter over the years.
'She was plainly otherwise likely to have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.'
Lost data official to be charged
The Cabinet Office official who left top secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was on secondment from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least sensitive charge under the act and no evidence of criminal intent is given.
Gardner told the BBC that the move would have come as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
They will have thought this was internally handled at the MS and Cabinet Office, he added.
The employee, who cannot be identified, is being charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause which deals with safeguarding information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he misplaced contained classified assessments about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
The decision was announced on Monday morning and he was moved from his home to an unnamed location.
Building society faces B&B bill
Britain's building businesses may face a £80m bill after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government provided £14bn to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all firms that take savers' money, including the 59 building societies.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was "galling" that businesses and their members had to pay.
The £14bn loan will eventually be repaid as Bradford & Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
The interest which will accrue in the meantime will be charged to the 700 financial companies that take deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies would be included in that number.
It is a shame that institutions that acted prudently ... are now being called upon to pay some of the bills of institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each firm had to pay proportionately to its deposits, and that the between them businesses had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450m in 2009.
The society will have to find £81m to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Building Society's Trade Association, told the BBC that it is unfair.
The shock is that institutions that acted prudently in the housing market upswing are now being called on to pay some of the bills of institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since its records began in 1945.
They will need to review all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options are available to protect building societies and their members from what could be a significant bill.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 a full year’s interest will be due and that could be almost double as much.
Building societies are mutual organisations with no shareholders, and their members will end up paying the bill either through higher charges or lower interest rates on saving accounts.
Milk to go up five pence a litre
People in Jersey are facing having to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by an extra five pence a litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, followed by a two pence rise in February, and is followed by research carried out by a consultancy company.
Retailers are to decide for themselves if they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
After the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bangladesh ex-PM is denied bail
A Bangladesh court has rejected a bail request of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
The court refused to grant her bail over charges of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was PM.
The case is one of several corruption charges pending against her.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail last month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks but her party, the Awami League, has called for full freedom.
While she was given parole to go abroad for medical treatment, it is unclear under the terms of her release if she will remain in liberty when she returns to Bangladesh.
The lawyers say that she will now appeal in the Supreme Court against the high court order.
The High Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail petition, saying she is not going to get bail as she is already undergoing treatment abroad on parole.
"We will file an appeal against the High Court order."
The lawyers argue that she needed bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October, a senior Awami League party leader said on Sunday.
The woman was detained last year after the army-backed interim government assumed power, but was released in June to travel to abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaled Zia deny all charges against them.
Fears for Afghan polio drive
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan missed a recent polio immunisation drive because of violence linked to the Taleban, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
It says it cannot reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite promise from the Taleban to not attack or impede thousands of staff carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkySky loses ITV legal challenge
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission's decision cutting its stake in rival ITV.
BSkyB has been told by the Competition Appeal Tribunal to cut its holding in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission believed that BSkyB's stake hindered competition and allowed it unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively prevented NTL from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's acquisition of its stake in ITV shed doubts about the independentness of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to launch a probe.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom all opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that reducing its ITV stake was unreasonable and disproportionate remedy, particularly as BSkyB had previously given it a written recourse to its voting rights.
New US lawyer affair probe
The US Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to look into the firing of nine US lawyers in 2006.
The move came as a report from the Justice Department inspector general criticised the actions of administration officials.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Advocate Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the probe lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
serious allegations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The row began when nine US lawyers were removed from their posts by the US Department of Justice in December 2006.
The department reported that the lawyers were fired for poor performance.
The later evidence emerged that the fired lawyers were not rated poorly than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to believe that the sackings were politically motivated.
Some lawyers have been involved in the prosecution of highly elected Republican members of Congress, while others have refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
US lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
Their removal may be at any time, but may not be for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was reportedly under fire for the sackings and eventually resigned.
A number of other justice department officials also resigned.
The general inspector general's report was highly critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the affair, which says he "abdicated" his leadership role and was "remarkably uninvolved" in the process.
Other officials, including former senior Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticised for failing to cooperate with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic to be honored
Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out of Hell.
The singer, who will collect his special golden award next week in London, said he was "honored" to receive the award.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's hit 1977 album.
Coldplay are leading the nominations for this year's awards, making the shortlist of four categories.
Paul Rees, Q magazine's editor, said: "There are some songs that transcend such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is surely one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a huge vocal, which was delivered by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental section that lasted for about two minutes.
The song was released as a single in UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15.
The album spent around nine years in the chart and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure City Street, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other streets, some famous, others merely utilitarian.
The location of Extra Place is difficult to describe, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The street is in East Village and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty alleyway more than an active street.
There are no street signs.
It is virtually impossible to see on a standard atlas.
The street does have admirers.
Avalon Bay, the developer of recently constructed luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to repave Extra Place and create a clean passageway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new building.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who told them they were charmed by the truncated lane simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block's pregentrified past.
The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in holding on to it.
The neighborhood community board's land use committee last month presented a proposal for the developer to acquire the street.
The committee wanted to keep the street in the city's hands, and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community Board 3.
”There is very little city-owned space left, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” she said.
The proposals for fixed it up and management it could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access.
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the street and install seats, including some to be used by a cafe to which the developer expects to lease space.
Avalon Bay might acquire the street in the first meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
Avalon Bay's main concern is refurbishing this fallen alleyway and turning it into a public amenity.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was indeed the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
In contrast to its more interesting neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical footprint.
The name of the farm was given in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was unclaimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened onto Extra Place, and the street is probably best known as the setting for the cover photograph of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
The ground was magnificent, said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was filled with junk, shreds of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the small piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have called it a rare sight - a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in Process of Going Extinct") posted part of a Talk of the Town story about Extra Place that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow little dead end street, dark even by day and marked off by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with week-old newspapers blowing along the gutters.
With few exceptions, the street looked much like last night.
A rat skittered across the street near a door that used to lead into CBGB, now the site of an upscale clothing store.
Graffiti was on wall and a empty 22-ounce beer bottle lay near a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.
The few passersby reported that they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested that it could be updated.
Fields, for his part, believed that some people were underestimating the appeal of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life," he said, "were in places that were dark, damp and swollen.
The Bilingual Debate: English Immersion
In this installment of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior fellow in California studies and senior Director of Education Studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why Middle Class Schools Need Choice.”
Making effective appeals to Hispanic voters is a tricky business.
Obama's education proposals are a case in point.
The Obama campaign says that, "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
The Obama education plan specifically advocates transitional bilingual education for English-learning.
The question for Mr Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom instruction in other languages, overrides his interest in achievement gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in southern Los Angeles County.
The school's students are mostly Hispanic and low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are recently arriving, are learning English.
However, among fourth graders, an astounding 100 percent of the students tested at a proficient level on the 2008 state math exam.
A nearly equally amazing 93 percent of fourth graders tested proficient on the state English-language-arts exam.
This incredible success was achieved by using a different ingredient than the one favored by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of skills and no excuses attitude.
Additionally, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Sixth Street's principal, the school's teaching approach for English learners is "full immersion."
English immersion emphasizes the near-exclusive use of English in content instruction.
Ms Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "we have had tremendous success with a student who is brand new from Mexico and you would walk into a classroom 12 months later and you would not know who he was.
It is working, she observed, "it is working for us."
How would Mr Obama hold up a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for replication by other schools with large Hispanic and English-learner populations?
The school's achievement results should make the answer to that question a no-brainer, but the education politics within his own party (the National Education Associations has been a long time supporter of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education obscure his response.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Mr Obama recently trivialized the issue when he told people to stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he added, "you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr Obama truly wishes to close gaps in education, he should carefully consider education models that work rather than scorn or trivialize them.
Oil Falls Sharply on Renewed Economic Fears
Prices of oil plunged sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets may not revive the economy.
Brent crude oil futures fell by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in morning trading.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shocked by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, and two powerful Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel last month, before once again rising to $90 a barrel on the back of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Fear gripped investors again on Monday after Congress leaders reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest debt recovery plan in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh financial crisis concerns.
In the latest episode of the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the intensive weekend negotiations that led to the bailout agreement "appear to have failed to revive market sentiment."
As economic situation deteriorates, the demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to slow.
The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate markets is increasingly uncertain, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe commodities will not survive the pandemic.
From a commodity perspective our most important concern is how the US virus spreads globally and specifically to China.
The bank's analysts reduced their expectations for next year as oil consumption drops because of slowing economic growth, reducing their oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
Second Quarter Spree Sets Team Record
After spending more time in a Jets uniform than any other player, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter unfold Sunday, when the Jets transformed a scoreless game into a blowout.
"Never seen anything quite like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals matched the gloomy clouds hanging overhead with sloppy play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown strike, providing the perfect warning for an afternoon when they took a huge leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, including one when a cornerback fell down and another with 10 seconds left in the quarter.
"I did not go out of my way," Favre said of all the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.
While Favre and Cole played catch, the defense slaughtered Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Forward Darrelle Revis intercepted an errant throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tipped another pass and intercepted it.
Warner forced a fumble by Bowens.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, might have been the most serious.
The Cardinals had taken control of that possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal for a 34-0 lead.
The most the Jets had ever scored in a quarter was the most they had ever scored in a quarter.
asked to describe the craziness of it, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets allow 21 unanswered points in the second quarter - Mangini said:
There were a lot of points scored in a short time.
Gebrselassie Tops World Record
Ethiopian Haile Gebeslassie repeated his claim to be the most distance runner ever, breaking his world record in Berlin on Sunday and being the first person to run the 26.2-mile race under 2 hours 4 minutes.
With a victory on an accommodatingly flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie smashed by 27 seconds his previous mark of 2:04:26, run last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record of a career of such a stunning breadth that he has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
The last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly - that air pollution would exacerbate his asthma.
Instead, he signed to run in Berlin.
In near perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at start, 55 degrees at finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a stunning 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have turned to longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and had missed a week of training.
The layoff left him fresh, not rusty.
"I am so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect. "
I started again a week ago, and had some doubts today, but in the end everything was fine.
However, he has been acknowledged for overly orchestrating his marathons, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, using pacemakers as if it were a track race, and placing world records ahead of competition.
This criticism does not decrease the greatness of Gebrselassie's skill as a distance runner.
Paced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point in 1:02:04.
The two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi kept fighting Gebrselassie after the pacemakers fade.
Then, a little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final surge to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by close to five minutes.
Kamathi took second in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who now becomes a German citizen, completed a remarkable year with a time of 2:19:19, the seventh-fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was surprised to become the London Marathon winner in 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games were missed with a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin, setting a personal best by nearly five minutes in the third marathon she has run.
The Ethiopian runner ran a smart calculation, allowing four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to break out to a wide lead, then repelling them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia took second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a Town Apart, the Pride and Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the theme-park sprawl of greater Orlando, a few miles from the shiny, the loud and the gargantuan, lies a quiet town where pride and complications of African-American experience come to life.
Eatonville, the first all-black town in the country, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimmers, two schools and no jailhouse."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Lily Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The town she described - and made a tourist stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a place apart.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who knows so little about us, he cannot know what he is missing.
In a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has called for open conversation about race, many here remain concerned about the outsider's gaze.
They are very careful about how our story is told.
"It needs to be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic model of black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 with almost double the national average.
It is a literary hub but also an oak-shaded example of rural Southern black culture - sometimes disdaised, sometimes praised - that was born of American slavery.
However, residents here are both proud and protecting.
The concern about Eatonville's image started with Zora, which is what most people here call Hurston.
The world was introduced to her hometown through heartfelt, dialect-heavy books like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guidebook transformed the town, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the unknown center of Florida into a stage of black history and human drama.
Always a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by the first mayor, Joe Clarke, then moved into more private areas.
"Off the road on the left is the brown with white trim modern public school, with its well-kept yard and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always maintains, though he cannot read and write.
The wife of Widow Dash also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "serves all kinds of drinks and anything goes with transient rooms."
In a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville with self-government but also remarriage and sex.
Clearly, Fodor's this was not.
In fact, it was not a portrait everyone appreciated.
"Zora told it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing off-color songs about their beauty.
The woman added: "Some people did not like that."
Hurston is still remembered as a very enthusiastic eccentric who frequently returns after her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stood in town she usually appeared without notice in a thumping Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a town that still values dignified dress.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many sneered.
"People always loved Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
Then, he added, sitting in his chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely to be baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had fallen out of print.
With much of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Though she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had been living.
In Eatonville, no major memorial services, no public readings.
They could not understand her contribution to the world or her legacy at all, according to Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Hurston biography published in 2003.
The turning point came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane highway through the community to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's typical two-lane main street.
Orlando's sprawl had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of town.
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the community's relatively idyllic isolation.
In 1950s, the fight over racial mixing brought hate to the community's doorstep.
Then, a group of white boys would come through and throw oranges and things at people sitting on the side.
"We actually had a lady that got killed from that.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration, calling it "insulting my race" and calling it "insulting my race."
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, while positive in some respects, diluted Eatonville's coherence and undermined the confidence of its young.
'Black children were known to be hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher at night', said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the Executive Director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
Then, she added, the teacher and students would not come from the same place.
'You were not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there is a cultural divide there'.
However, civil rights created space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who rose above prejudice with buoyant self-assurance and lines like:
It's beyond me.
In 1975, Alice Walker took the unmarked grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Then, a successful biography by Robert E Hemenway hit the books, reintroducing Hurston to American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter had once again found the spotlight.
Then Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning in 1988 for a Hurston festival to show what the county could ruin with its highway.
The first event was held two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county backed away from its road proposal.
The five lanes of the highway resurrected, it created a very real civic pride, she added.
Zora saved Eatonville.
The victory over the highway project has helped change the town's self-image.
Out-of-town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, started to appear in larger numbers, and residents started to revalue the past.
Eatonville joined the national historic registry in 1998.
New one-story library (named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on a repaved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from downtown Orlando, it can, at times, feel like a back street in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with only 27 black families in 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for Eatonville's story, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
Early permission is required for most interviews, and some things - like the murals at Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man, showing black men in the field - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms Jones, a bold, confident teacher partial to bright red, still fear that their isolation will be misunderstood.
The Hurston festival has expanded, and a heightened level of hometown pride has also emerged.
Teenagers, particularly, tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, problems and all, no better, no worse and as proud, creative, hard working, silly and mixed-up as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
The genuine civic affection can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to come back to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department.
However, even younger children, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
'Most people, if they just drive through here, they'll think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other city,' " Alondra Kenon said after church on a recent Sunday.
It's a very nice city.
New York we all speak fluent finance.
On the face of it, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from newsstands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not realize they were standing in the eye of a storm.
Their eyes would never know that in glass-fronted, honeycomb offices above them the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York are daily having the worst "bad day at the office" since the 1929 crisis.
Delivery boys still rattle metal tea trolleys across sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latino men still walk between apartment buildings carrying, like human mules, 50-odd pressed shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders.
Office workers still wait in line for their morning bagel at pavement food carts, and yellow cabs are still unavailable on weekdays.
The crisis was not quite a crisis, until, with all the talk of doom and gloom, I opened a new savings account on Thursday afternoon.
The chore was timed to coincide with the late afternoon lull at my local JP Morgan Chase branch.
They are not in front of the teller windows, to withdraw cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service desk, where old clients order cheque books, tourists ask for directions to Macy's department store and new customers open accounts.
Most of those ahead of me, I learn later from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", were lining up for the same reason as me.
Then, they had already withdrawn savings from smaller banks in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
The money was collected from so-called thrifts (a bit like a building society), credit unions and the type of hometown savings banks that only have branches in one state and who treat customers like family.
In the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly gone bust.
In recent days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went into receivership, and as New Yorkers headed home on Friday night, Wachovia, with $440 billion of savings deposits, was on the hunt for a rescue buyer.
The office and shop workers standing in front of me, fearful of another collapse, were moving their cash to a bank perceived to be safe haven, the bank that is doing most of the bailout on Wall Street.
Average New Yorkers in recent weeks have become fluent in finance.
The woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking into her phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bust bank, and its gorgeous chief executive Dick Fuld with all the familiarity she can get from talking to a idle colleague.
Lyn, the uniformed, fifty-something concierge of my apartment block, has changed tack from our normal conversation about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery.
Then she told me, after my visit to the bank, that I have all my savings in money market funds now.
I have switched, I am not taking any risks.
Muslim graves seized as Austria swings to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of Austrian right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgium right-wing party Vlaams Belang, participate in a demonstration to present the organisation of "Cities against Islamisation" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008.
The signs are traffic-style signs depicting mosques with a red line running through.
Crime officials are blaming far right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far right political parties made huge gains in the country's general election.
The damage to the remaining graves at the Traun Cemetery in Linz occurred between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organised action.
The suspects sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some of the graves, but authorities believe this may have been a bid to disguise the motives of extremists driving a hatred of Muslims.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
The local Islamic Community spokesman said they were "deeply shocked" at the news of the desecration, which is coming as the Muslim religious month of Ramadan nears its end.
Austria is taking a soul searching round after its shift to right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have campaigned on a very anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans have been deemed xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party that won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and even against food that is considered to be related to Islam.
The final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties aim to ban the building of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were political symbols of an ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Early polling and analysis conducted after the elections, which established the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change was caused by predominately young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter banned from travel abroad
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sex abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Justices imposed the six month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Glitter was granted the foreign travel ban last Thursday after providing evidence of previous convictions for child sex abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at Ashford Magistrates court in Kent but he was represented by Corker Binning.
A Court Service spokesman said: "Thursday September 25 at Ashford Magistrates' Court, Kent Police applied for a temporary suspension of foreign travel to France and Spain until March 25 by Mr Paul Gadd.
Paul Gadd did not attend.
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad as he is required to be in the sex offenders register.
The authorities must give notice if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
The officer is also required to give police seven days notice of his planned departure date.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five year prison sentence.
Kent Police said they would not discuss individual cases or the possible location of Glitter in the county.
A Kent Police spokeswoman said: "Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our perspective, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have comprehensive systems to manage any potential risks.
"Protecting the residents of Kent is our main concern and we closely monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county to minimise any risk to the public that may exist.
Glitter returned to UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnam jail for the abuse of two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was freed Glitter flew to Bangkok where he was due to board a flight to London.
The elderly said he was ill and would not fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not allow him through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
However, Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
The suspect was finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22, and stayed there while his solicitor David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west London, to get a Scotland Yard order to register him as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed in UK for four months in 1999 for possessing pictures of child abuse.
The Home Office source said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary was reassured and glad that Glitter has been stopped traveling to France and Spain.
Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels nor ruffles or stage clothing.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentrated concentration characterizing the interpretation, to face a relaxed man or woman.
On one hand the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
The two sides are uncoupled except in private life. In those moments, away from the public, the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen glance or the emphasis of hands are natural expressions because they are not prepared for the stage.
Günther Bauer, in his work "Flamenco-People", alternates the theatricality of some shots of singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with their private and less known beings.
This is the photograph's aim when collecting an original iconography of flamenco, taken from different perspectives.
The exhibition, included in the Month of Flamenco Photography program, reflects the importance of international flamenco, which is increasing day by day.
The people I portrayed on street are artists able to convey passion, sadness and joy on stage ... and finally, to capture their audience.
The time to catch the personality of these artists taking pictures of the scene is over.
It is much more an inner personality and character.
Flamenco is a very personal experience that allows me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco by my camera.
Bauer began his career as a performer, guitarist and dancer in 1997 with a deep passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas".
The choice of the camera and equipment makes these portraits remind classic photos.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional iconographic principles, giving the photos modernity, as Bauer describes flamenco as a music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day more.
It is not the dancing, the singing or the play itself, but the artist's personality, his character, able to conquer the audience through his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain feeling, are and have been constant elements in this work, now on display at the gallery El Fotómata.
The famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chan Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo are included in this selection of around seventy portrayed artists.
The project has also become an anthology of flamenco, going to be published in a book that collects the portraits of the exhibition.
The passion for the portrait led Bauer to re-create the idea two years later with "Portraits of veteran athletes" (SportARTproject).
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to penetrate into their lives for a while, either long or short time.
I think portray is the most difficult subject in photography.
You meet or face people and characters sometimes you even know or persons who give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.
The collection of contemporary flamenco portraits, entitled "Flamenco-people", is exhibited at the gallery El Fotómata, Via de la Mata 20, which is a parallel street to the Alameda de Hercules. The exhibition will be open to the public from 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa admits the novel he is writing is a "chance"
The novel sets in a place the author has not yet known and tells of an unfamiliar subject.
The writer, always favoured for the Nobel Prize in Literature, confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the draft is a "chance" and that I should not write it down.
'If I had good sense, I would not write it, but I hope to finish it once and for all.'
The author of "City and dogs" was a major figure in the third edition of the word's festival, as forecasted.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize being the most voted writer by participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend" by Dickens, filled the Juan Bravo Theatre with fans.
Romeo spoke to a public whose time flies when the Peruvian author started to recollect his literary vocation, which is a "extraordinary adventure and pleasure of reading" and underlined how his vocation is arising from the "extraordinary adventure and pleasure of reading".
The Hispanic-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people's lives."
The weather hinders the Pozoblanco festival, which remains with no bullfights.
The bullfights which were to seal the days of Pozoblanco festival were suspended yesterday morning after the bull fighters ensured that the square's soil conditions were not adequate for the celebrations.
The company, together with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the bullfighting.
The weather was very harsh against this Festival and prevented two over three celebrations.
The rain had prevented the holding of the second bullfight.
The billboard included Jose Luis Moreno, Curran Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would have faced a bull of Castilblanco.
The only celebration was on Friday.
This was the triumph of Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was brought on shoulders after he had beef fighting with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights and collected greetings and one ear, which was given by the public more than by the quality of the bullfight itself.
The worst was Juli, who went through the bull-ring of Los Llanos with no glory, no penalty.
With the second bull, after a huge muleta, he earned the boos of a bigger part of the public.
A van loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses a roadblock in Alava.
Ten to six in the morning.
Traffic control by the Ertzaintza in the municipal district of Armiñón (Alava).
The officials order the two occupants of a van to stop but they choose to flee.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason for not stopping.
The officers chase after them, and arrest one of two occupants, as reported in a press release by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested person is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
This occurred when some officials of the Alava Highway Police were conducting an audit of transport on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the district town of Armiñón.
The police were going to stop a van for inspection when the driver, breaching the orders, sharply accelerated and just skipped the road block.
The officials chased the van until it stopped after a couple of miles on the edge of the road, and its two occupants flew into a wooded area.
The authorities managed to arrest one of the fugitives and, after the inspection of the vehicle – an Iveco Daily, seized 2178 kilograms of hashish.
The hashish blocks, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were then placed under police custody for further investigation and detection of weight.
Additionally, since the chassis number was "duplicated" because it did not coincide with the one reported in the van's documentation, the arrested man was also charged with public documents' falsification.
The ECDC is continuing its investigations to arrest the second suspect who managed to flee as mentioned above, and to determine the origin of seized drugs.
The prisoner, A. A. J., 28 years old, was conducted to the police station to perform the appropriate procedures. He will be available to the court in the coming hours.
The actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving while addicted to drugs.
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) after driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her performing inappropriate maneuvers while trying to take her car out of a parking spot in Montecito, as revealed to People magazine by a spokesman for the California Highway Police.
The evidence states that around 4.30pm Ms. Locklear "crushed the accelerator very intensively, making excessive noise and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with abrupt back and forth maneuvers. By reversing she moved several times in front of his sunglasses.
The witness, who initially appeared to have not seen the actress, saw Ms. Locklear stopping in a nearby street and leaving the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because he was concerned about Ms Locklear's life.
The police patrol arrived and found the actress sitting inside her car, which was partially blocking the road.
The police took her to a specialized centre for drugs and alcohol and sent her for a test.
The actress has proven collaborative and the theory of excessive alcohol was discarded since the first moment, even if "as the officers observed at first sight, we believe Ms. Locklear was under the influence of any drug."
Ms Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of some - not better specified substance, and taken to the local jail at 7.00pm, to be released some hours later.
Two months ago, Ms Locklear was out of a specialist clinic in Arizona where she was cured after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazes calls for the Andalusian federation of IU to take its responsibilities in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the general coordinator of IU and member of Izquierda Unida, confirmed today that the decision for the case concerning Francisco Manuel Silva, resigned last week after being accused of cronyism, will be taken by the Regional Federation for Training.
'I am very federalist when considering such issues, and Andalusian organization must take its responsibilities', he added.
The leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding Silva's irregularities, "The UI always wanted transparency in all possible investigations regarding Silva's irregularities, and I always wanted transparency in all possible investigations.
Similarly, he stressed that training is under "very strict ethics codes for all public functions."
May fever is an epic challenge by Garci.
Jose Luis Garci, inspired by the novel Episodios Nacionales of Banito Pérez Galdós, recreates in Sangre de mayo the Spanish popular riot against the French.
The Director has tried to "explain the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, which he always admired in his work.
May blood, a film longer than 2.30 hours, is now being broadcast on TV in the future.
The director of this film says that it was a dream of his childhood.
The 15 million budget totally allocated by the Community of Madrid represented a unique opportunity to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a "stunned Spain that chose the wrong leader to fight for and that the fight for independence led to huge delays in development during the reign of Ferdinand VII".
However, the director is regretful not having received equal funding from Alatriste or Goya - more than two times as much as Sangre de mayo.
The difference in budget influenced the way the director of Volver a empezar works, for example, the stage with the actors, with whom he often uses to rehearse before shooting with the ones who do not belong to the cast, and thinking that the work of the director lies in going to the theater and to the cinema to understand how the industry is going on.
The following players, some of which are included in the Sangre de mayo cast, repeat behind his video camera.
The three nominees for the Oscar this year, his Sangre de mayo, Six French dinners, and The selected illness birds, are not representing the younger generation of Spanish cinema, so it should be known.
Garci is not expecting awards from this film.
Once you start working for posterity, you realize you only work for prosperity, and at some point you just shoot a film more.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the essence of the siviglian dancer
A siviglian dancer pays tribute to another siviglian dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, mother from Catalonia (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and mother from Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district, and moved with her family to London when three.
She was a ballet dancer and a free style and oriental dance specialist.
The life of a woman was quite fascinating and she was a pioneer of women's emancipation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and supported the cause for the abolition of the corset, which prevents women from moving freely.
The life of this woman that marks a revolution in the aesthetics of dance in Europe between two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed me to interpret this character. It seemed to me incredible."
The singer says, "we do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect her spirit.
The titles of her dances suggested some elements of flamenco.
Then, "The Butterfly Dance" suggested me a gujara, or the "bird dance" some tangos.
The dance was sensual and I was told my way of dancing is part of this aesthetic.
The stage includes two outstanding contributions: Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of the shows, as he did in "La puerta abierta" and the master Matilde Coral, who especially wanted to work with a former student of hers.
Matilde interprets Tortola in adulthood, she is the character of maturity.
Very happy she accepted to play in my work and I feel very honoured for this.
The stage also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers as Miguel Ortega, Pulga y Moi of Morón and the percussion of El Pájaro, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez, who plays the role of eternal companion of such artists, who were real round stars and always had many lovers.
This work also tells something about this woman’s life because it mainly took place in distant places, such as India, USA or Russia, and using her to live in London.
Because I thought she was one of those women who had an enormous influence in a specific period. Today nobody remembers her and even considers her work as value.
The show will start on stage today, 20.30pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication "Diario de un poet recién casado" closes the 3 Years Anniversary celebration.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "Diario de un Poet Reciencasado" at Saint Stephen's Church(New York), the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is a part of the plan for the 3 Years Anniversary of Zenobia and Juan Ramon.
The second edition of the work is the second edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel laureate, and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: A light drop" which was inaugurated last May and is expected to be brought to New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Andalusia Committee's Department of Culture has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" edited by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to promote and disseminate the figure and works of one of the most important Andalusian poets.
We like America a bit less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of those.
The sentence is by Sally Field, who worked with Newman in "A false threat" and gives the feeling of American cinema's impotence, and throughout America, seeing Newman go.
The Oscar awarding him with him was quite difficult.
And in 2007 he retired.
People also knew he was very ill.
Although this was a very hard blow for all.
When you feel your feelings go far beyond words, and now I lost a great friend, Robert Redford, my life and my country improved quite a lot thanks to his existence.
No one was afraid of anything very high or exaggerated.
The father of cinema and of the country died in a particularly dark period, with the fear of terrorists and markets, with American people's self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking new reasons to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so less virtuous and with few people to love, you have not to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all people he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
The official enemy of Richard Nixon was a loyal supporter of lost and won causes, starting with the foundation to fight drugs he created in honour of the firstborn who died of overdoses to the promotion of a new brand for home-made and organic food.
All gifts he gave to a country that had to pay huge costs to get beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration spread beyond Hollywood, independently from nationality or passport.
The latest James Bond, the English actor Daniel Craig, pointed to a time which is over.
The other Englishman, Sam Mendes, a director who won the Oscar, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, arrived to define Paul Newman as his most inspiring figure.
The highest level of responsibility and serious private life is a lesson for all of us, says George Clooney.
This is not always easy or possible in modern media jungle.
However, some people will try and Paul Newman will remain a good example to inspire them.
After divorce, his second marriage with Joanne Woodward lasted for fifty years, and he remained faithful having opportunities for not being so.
Why am I going out to have my hamburgers, when I can have a good steak at home?" he asked himself.
In the sky he is accompanied by the pride of his daughters who are also his fans on earth.
”Of all the major roles he played, none was more proud than that of dedicated husband, loving father, attentive grandfather and passionate philanthropist” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
The dream of many of us is that one day Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt in 2012, it could happen in 2016.
However, I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday race, I just say no!
They called it the "perfect race" but in my opinion it was by far the worst I have seen.
All a nonsense, that if taken into account during the evaluation and I had to examine it, the output would be totally negative.
However, order and order will start from the very beginning.
The nonsense started with the collection of the back number, which supposedly means you went there before the race.
It was not a bad idea, but if you are forced to go, it should be to withdraw all things (including the chip to prevent queues during the race).
But this is not.
Then we went to collect the back number (first nonsense, just go for this only reason) and (after the queue) surprise! they only had S size T-shirts (second nonsense, I need an XL).
What kind of world are we living in?
It is to blame the crisis if they only bought small T-shirts, made with smaller tissue and thus less expensive?
The following things were nothing compared to the day of the race.
The queue was long and you had to carry your backpack.
The wait lasted for more than 35 minutes, something unusual for a race with more than 11,000 people.
Then, as expected, the race started when we had not even handed over the backpack, but, once succeeded, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, rain threatened the waiting for more than 40 minutes, which led to a combination of popular rebellion and attempts to stand.
They are believed to be around 500 people surely with pneumonia tomorrow, and some, like me, have not even been able to get the proper arrival order because of the chip, which, I believe, did not record the time of arrival.
In future, if I will be asked for the perfect race, this one will not enter my thoughts.
In the end I believe we will continue to dream of an Olympic and well prepared city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual)receptionist
The Microsoft preview of the new recognition and human interaction system was presented at the MIT Conference on Emerging Technologies, a kind of artificial intelligence but without that much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as call a taxi or, in the scenario described by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus.
The "receptionist" can know how many people are in a specific room, who are they, and how they are speaking with them.
It may also cluster people into groups of conversation.
The demo showed that the receptionist notes a third person, understands he is not part of the group he is talking with and that he is not a company employee.
It asks him if he is there to visit someone and says it will attend him as soon as possible.
This without any ugly blue screen.
Awesome.
This is the future, of course.
The company now has to focus on many other issues, such as the next Windows operating system release.
This week it was a big talk on Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not be charged with so many programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less commercial rubbish, they should be five times faster - hey! Steve, will be for less.
The real discovery is if one considers that Microsoft, version after version, has only added features and "extras" to Windows.
Change of direction is very welcome.
Microsoft is right: the operating system will increasingly lose its relevance, and the software with it.
The first time I saw Chrome I was one of those who support the theory that Chrome was the first step Google made to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be a necessity, because it is the essential element through which hardware and software can communicate.
It performs the same function as your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It is true.
It will never disappear, but you may need to think about the death of the operating system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one.
What Ballmer said week confirms this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system, and increasingly focus on the browser.
Their computer is only used to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - daily and spend more time browsing the web than working in a window environment.
What half of the operating system's applications are there for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft more interested in integrating its online services should be a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it.
I shot this photo during Microsoft employees' break, in Redmond, last month.
The sign, hanging on the soft drink machine, suggested users to use the company's search engine - Your search. Our Future.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the Internet.
The week after Microsoft confirmed the delay in development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be launched in the beginning of 2009, but even at the end of 2010, maybe in 2010.
Microsoft is probably going to try a joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
Our phone, at the end, is increasingly becoming a computer.
The delay, with Android and iPhone already on marketing, will result in detrimental consequences.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso used to dress it while on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio appeared in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola, and Al Pacino in 'Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola.
If we try to count the number of stars wearing it, we can also remember the image of the strong-built man with pointed mustache who lifted weights in the stroller circus.
This is nothing more than the typical T-shirt for men, with a cotton interior, tight and sleeveless shape.
The tank, as English speakers call it, is the most important feature of the Brussels Fabuleux Marcel.
First of all, this is due to its huge name - even if it is commonly known as "Marcel" - a name that has something to do with sport because it is derived from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, who loved Edith Piaf.
The "Marcel" is a winner - if compared to others - for its high quality cotton, for its unisex cutting, for his distinctive little shield and the small Belgian flag (barely recognisable) which most emblematic models keep on the neck.
Please open your eyes!, because the Belgian company produces not only its famous "tank".
The production also includes college sweats, vintage boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton trousers, sailor shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Comfortable clothing is designed.
It is a pity to use them as underwear.
They are too smart.
"I want to be a young mother, no matter the candidate"
The great appearance with her sister has not prevented her from developing a strong personality.
Monica Cruz is a small woman, but still full of vitality.
Currently both the Cruz sisters have taken very seriously their new activity in fashion.
According to Monica, it is much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their names.
The campaign took her to Paris for the launch of the new branch, and the presentation of the most important fashion prize for the house.
Warm and timid, she takes you quite quickly.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
Welcome to present the new collection my sister Penelope and I have designed for the new Mango autumn-winter season, to join the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
It is a very intense day but a very exciting one at the same time.
What is the inspiration for your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish fashion house?
Both my sister and I like the 1950s and 60s cinema. From there we get more inspiration.
Then I like to get lost in the city and look at women’s dress, at how they mix and mix their clothes. I do it quite frequently.
Dancing, actress and designer, you are a very versatile woman, are you?
I think so, but at the end, many elements remain cross-field ideas.
I liked clothes since I was a child. I loved visiting my grandmother to look through my aunt's cupboards and discover her clothes.
It was so good!, much better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always took great care of my dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style when going to class and dance recitals, to look themselves in the mirror and feel good.
In the actress role, when you are delivered the dress, this is the time you actually meet the character.
So, everything works together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionals.
When you celebrate your 30 years, you entered a crisis?
Absolutely I did not.
I have never felt better, I like being 30 years old.
I find it is the age when women are mature enough to enjoy life and commit less errors.
I am not scared by the biological clock.
Since I was a child I do all the things I liked and this gave me great inner happiness.
So, are you thinking of being mother or not?
Yes, I am. I know it is my body pushing me for this and I want to be a young mom, I am not going to miss it.
And about the candidate... It does not matter that much.
I will give my son happiness and I will educate him with more love.
When you talk about cinema, you are waiting for the release of some films you acted in last year.
It is, and I am really curious about that.
The theatre experience has made me a very anxious and anxious woman.
The most important ones are "Last Hour" and "The Search for the Tomb of Christ".
Read it...
When you started walking on the catwalk side by side with Naomi Campbell, did you?
Well, do not put it this way.
It is not I was on the catwalk as a professional model.
The clothes I brought to the show - I brought two pieces from our Mango collection - have been sold at auction to raise funds for this NGO.
People usually ignore this Naomi's tender heart.
It is said so many things about her that, knowing her well, I can assure you are not true.
Moreover, I like to share and get involved in this good part of hers.
The woman asked me to be shown for noble purposes, but if I had been asked to play a pine I would do it anyway.
You cannot back out from helping the third world women.
Drivers who are reactive to alcoholism should install the 'alcolock'
The Interior Office requires the driver under three administrative penalties for excessive alcoholic rate to install a system that prevents them from driving the vehicle when drunk. The same if you do not blow into the measuring device.
The measure was announced last June and has been included in the State Attorney General’s Annual Report, according to which it will be a pilot project for one year.
This project's goal is the reinstatement of the driver, as he will need to attend a course of road re-education.
The initiative is supported by the Director of Road Safety, together with the General Directorate of Traffic(DGTR) and the Technological Institute for Security in the Automobiles(FITS).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers fined more than once for drunk driving still drive a car.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this, because the device, connected to the vehicle, measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it or if it detects in the car a high alcoholic concentration.
The cost of the device, a bit more than 1000 euro, should be charged to the sanctioned.
In this regard, a 2007 study conducted in the United States proved that vehicles equipped with these devices can reduce the infringements by up to 65% during the first year of introduction.
In Spain it was estimated to save around 115 lives in one year.
The measure is restricted to administrative sanctions for two reasons: first of all to prevent these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses.
Second, to facilitate the implementation of this practice, as legal reform is normally made but the necessary reform of the criminal procedure requires an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has been introduced on experimental basis in some trucks and public transport.
Today, the Deputy Congress will vote on a PSOE initiative proposing to install the system in school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico, and without her pee-toes"
In line with the British punctuality, at 17.40 pm, the Spanish airline landed at the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City, bringing there the Prices of Asturias.
The sunset was almost done but the sun still forced you to use your hand as a visor to see the royal couple getting off the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other authorities stood at the foot of the ladder.
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver, along the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formally formalize their official travel.
- Very good, so we cannot go to airport and collect people in that time band...
- No, she is Spanish, but has been in your country for a couple of years.
- Ah well...
The Mexican press knows who are the Asturias princes and is aware of the importance of travel.
Many are those who wait for them at the airport, crowded together on the red carpet and close to a military line composed of 27 navy soldiers.
The prince is smiling, with a navy blue dress, and the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not wear her "peep-toes" as usual.
The photographers give photographers a smile and a short stopover before moving to the room where the official group is looking for them.
By the door of the hotel they are going to stay, one of the four biggest hotels in the city, a funny reporter of Mexican television waits for them.
Best fashion award
Probably there is no better place in the world than Paris to present a fashion award, and probably no living designer as Valentino is.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to support international promotion of new talent in fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the Mango window at number 54 of Haussmann Boulevard in Paris, and was almost crying for emotion.
The second largest store in Europe has been opened in 1335 square meters.
The most important one is located in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino, who chaired the jury of the contest, led to a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
The proximity of the most stunning paintings by Chagal made the presidential gala table even more spectacular.
Following the recent death of her brother, Nati, with a broken heart and a desire to become a virtuous, wore a dress of ELAH and fashion complements by ELAH that took your breath away.
Andik, owner and master of Mango, welcomed the guests and as the gentleman he is, with Baron Rotchil, arrived at the end of the night without his jacket, because both had given it to two women.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt - designed by herself – changed her dress for the dinner, wearing a long black dress.
Inés Sastre was not invited to join the walk inside the building, but before leaving showed us her son's photos on her mobile phone.
Next morning we welcomed the presence of Olivier Martinez - another boy who likes moving by motorbike - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel of Paris, bringing his own sheets, towels and only after asking for no smell in his room.
Stars under the starlit Paris sky.
Oh there, life is.
1001, the anti-stress number
It is not 1000 but 1000 and 1 way to forget the chaos and hectic everyday life.
If it seems not enough, all these ways have been collected in a book that will bring the relax to the bookstores by 30th September.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 o'clock, but the worst is imagining yourself in the frantic pace of modern life.
Office means strain, computer back pain.
Stress is the illness of the 21st century.
However, you are now offered no or two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle in taking proper distance from the work dimension.
No more no less than 1001 ways.
Beyond yoga poses, classic massage or the "spa treatments", Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book a menu of options designed to meet individual tastes and needs.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relax" and will be available in the library thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK publishers.
If someone believes winning the peace in areas such as business or personal relationships is not possible, this "manual" rejects that belief.
It also suggests alternatives, such as staying in touch with nature or providing 100% natural recipes that help to relax.
If adrenaline is not already flowing in your blood to produce balance, and stress has become a major problem for you, it's time to sit on the sofa, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking while sleeping
Some children speak during the night.
These are not those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but children who talk while sleeping.
The first time it happens, most of the time you get scared but it really does not have that much importance.
This is a mild alteration of sleep, defined as somniloquy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Most of you have been told to talk in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (just once in life, associated with a high fever episode) or on a more regular basis (e.g. every day, once a week, once a month ...).
There is no single reason to explain the presence of somniloquy.
Occasionally it may be linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, nocturnal enuresis (pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but it is not always the case.
As mentioned above, it may be associated with very high fever, in situations of stress or over excitement.
In any case, this phenomenon is not researched that well.
Even its intensity is extremely variable.
It may happen someone speaking with a very quiet voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches ...).
In case the event is particularly intense, the child should be observed and possibly a specialist should be consulted to check if the abnormal state of anxiety is caused by any question, thus generated by the child to vent his feelings.
The findings indicate that this is a benign alteration, and there is no specific treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. insomnia or stress).
What you can do is considering a number of very simple preventive measures, such as:
Please do not over-excite the child before going to sleep.
Suggest calm games and avoid television or series that inspire fear or suggest violence.
Very nervous children who are very difficult to relax need you to use relaxation techniques to help them acquire inner calm.
This will allow child to sleep more peacefully.
Once somniloquy appears, keep calm.
Remember that it is an inoffensive phenomenon for the child and that next day he will not remember anything about it.
Useful Tips
Do not wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is going on, and you just interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and thus he is resting.
Remember that if he appears very anguished and the episodes have a specific frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or to verify from where such anxiety originates.
If you get what he is saying (which is not the most common situation) do not fall into the trap of making him an interrogation to obtain information.
Do not get anything, because he is sleeping and he is not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you only hear what he says but you cannot see what he is thinking about.
Do not ever tell your child you can ask him something during the night to know his secrets.
Not even jokingly.
This can generate huge anxiety.
However, do not worry, it's not serious, just a short episode.
Illhaean... finally
Illhaeusern has finally recovered its path to victory on its own ground after a long period of draught.
With no good match, Yellow and Black have created the most occasions and managed to turn one of them into the match winner.
The rhythm was not very steady during the match and the attackers found it difficult to express themselves.
After a first attempt by the guest captain Kauffmann who narrowly missed the goal, Illhaeusern took the lead and then Hirn from high, Romain with his foot or again Diebold took the lead.
At the front, there was a midfield block that allowed only the centre forward Riahi to lead the attack.
The second half was decisive with the first two occasions dominated by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, immediately after the score was opened for Illhaeuserns by Marais, well positioned to pick a ball from an initial attempt by Diebold (53').
The Illhaeusern striker was not able to enjoy his success for long and returned to the locker room a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates numerically inferior.
The damage was not huge to the Illhaeusern Eleven who simply moved back to make its defence more compact.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen.
After leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to visit Brittany.
Following the display of force by the fishermen who on Monday disturbed access to several ports in Brittany and Normandy, the Republic has decided to yield and meet their representatives.
The latter have promised to accept "with a constructive spirit" and they hope he will arrive with practical proposals.
The visit occurs alongside the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by fishermen in Brittany to discuss measures to address the rising prices of oil, which peaked at an average of 1.14 Euro per litre.
The president will discuss solutions that can be developed to help their enterprise recover competitiveness and secure employment conditions and sailors' remuneration.
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishmen.
The early morning operation in the Morbihan and Calvados caused traffic jams for about 10 km.
The leisure craft harbour of Quiberon was also blocked, but the roads to Belle-Isle were not blocked.
Filtering roadblock was set on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and on the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained docked at the quayside or Le Havre, where about 20 boats blocked any movement of any merchant ship.
Fishing in La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, in the evening stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery at Donges.
The ones in Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until after the meeting at the ministry on Wednesday to decide on possible action.
In Guilin, the crisis committee will decide on Tuesday whether to comply with the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
The Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the National Committee of Fisheries, which did not support their movement.
The strike will continue because "fishermen will not give up" and "do not want to move to Paris", according to Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay tax on diesel currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the threshold of profitability for a vessel is achieved at less than 0.30 Euro per litre .
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts or Sam Mendes paid tribute to the cinema legend and devoted actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 planes to be delivered this year despite threats of recession hanging over the global economy.
The fourth largest global aircraft manufacturer, Embraer will maintain its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, according to Fredrico Fleury Curado, its Chairman.
In the first semester, the manufacturer has delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazil manufacturer took a lot of hope on the Chinese market, especially for its 30 to 120 seat range.
Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would ced more than 15% of its assets to the public.
The International American Insurance Group, which the US monetary authorities have refloated, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion that was advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
According to the newspaper, AIG is ready to explore the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its pension business in the United States, according to sources close to the case.
The management board of AIG meeting on Sunday evening to consider possible cessations, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to ced out include its leasing subsidiary Air International Lease Financial Corp., its participation of 59% in the reinsured Transatlantic Holdings, and its property portfolio, the FT added.
No final decision has been taken on these disposal, the FT continued.
AIG must quickly find the funds to repay the 85 billion loan with the Federal Reserve or risk losing 80% of its shares, which is almost equal to current shareholders.
Historic Morning Meeting
New York Stock Exchange showed a historical fall on Monday after the House Republicans rejected the Paulson plan to rescue the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen since reaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10365.45 points.
The biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
The Nasdaq index, mainly technological, has lost 199.61 points to 1983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index has lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
The meeting started with a crisis at the start of the meeting, after the unexpected rejection of the rescue plan for banks that was aimed at injecting some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 for, the delegates have refused to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the resources he requested.
Another two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
The negative signal for the market is that Congress failed to adopt a plan, according to Lindsey Piegża of FTN Financial.
The evidence shows how much the market relied on this plan, and she fears that a draft draft adopted in several days time can be "too late".
The project is effectively dead, then the relay will quickly pass to the Fed (i.e. the U.S. central bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions.
The further accentuation of the urgency, "each day that passes sees the fall of another financial institution in the United States," stressed Mrs Piegża.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities have organized the takeover of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated, leading to emergency interventions by banks in the UK, Benelux and Germany, a sign of a global crisis, added the analyst from FTN Financial.
The bond market has climbed sharply.
The performance of 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632%, against 3.827% on Friday evening.
Obama, who won on points the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has taken place to see who, John McCain or Barack Obama, will win.
The campaign headquarters of the Republicans and the Democrats have declared their own victory in the televised duel which was watched by a third of American families.
The political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though admirable, was not brilliant enough to reverse its decline in the polls five weeks after the election.
The Gallup, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five points lead (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that the Democratic party has pulled their own on Thursday.
According to a CBS poll, among undecided voters, Obama has won 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give victory to McCain.
According to the expected performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
It would be mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts nonetheless.
The seventh-term McCain has repeatedly pointed to his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that ..." he repeatedly accused.
Senator Obama has no experience and knowledge to be president, he added.
The attack was hammered yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama, himself, has stressed that he represents the future.
Without disassembling, he was concise and precise.
The ability to make right decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world was a priority.
"McCain has never understood, while Obama, if" was a Democratic spot against the Republican for not taking the full measure of the impact of the crisis on Americans on the street.
When John McCain spoke about me, he had much to say about me but nothing about you, Obama told 20 000 people assembled for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in the pouring rain.
The financial crisis clearly gives Obama a advantage, as he is considered by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink of a precipice.
The coming week could be a turning point, estimated yesterday by the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an alumnus of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's good economic instincts to Bill Clinton in 1998.
The Democratic candidate believes the current crisis is the final verdict of eight years of poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
While he continued to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans despite the turmoil on Wall Street, the Illinois senator reiterated that the goal of achieving energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his first priority, along with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he wanted to build a cluster of 45 nuclear plants by 2030.
Cautious, both candidates have avoided questions about the 700 billion dollar (470 billion Euro) rescue plan approved yesterday by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "have you noticed that there was an election, have you?"
Youth and other opposition gathered Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the outcome of the law.
The Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening at the closing of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent elections.
While no results have yet been announced, many young people came to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation."
Some do not even vote: "Why, since they will do whatever they want of my voice?" asked a young man.
They do not believe that the regime which has made good impression with foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, which include visa bans for 40 Belarusian officials and the freezing of assets, may be lifted if the elections are seen as appropriate by the observers.
They have not been according to the opposition.
Observers were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count.
It is a cosmetic change, says Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement.
If opposition members enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
Their entry into parliament could mean television, meetings in regions, and proposed laws.
The opposition should enter the politics because "we must open a dialogue with the European Union.
If our economy, heavily indebted with Russia, enters a crisis and if we do not reform ourselves, we risk being a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) does not recognise the validity of the ballot.
The candidate stressed that the figures seem too high, and that the spread in voter turnout (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the vote to all sorts of manipulations.
'Have you noticed that there was an election?' asked Kozulin, one of two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was nobody at the voting offices.
The maximum number of opposition members will be five, those who are most convenient to the powers that are in power.
The night falls on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee welcomed their success.
The interview - Blood becomes safe again
Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated its 10th anniversary, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Most importantly, it has re-established the trust of the public who was seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national reservoirs managed by the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross have been infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Following this tragedy and public discontent, the Canada Government established in February 1994 a public inquiry, headed by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances behind such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster again.
While Krever delayed in his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Canada, the Gélineau Committee has fulfilled that mandate.
In Canada, two suppliers were created: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Supply for all other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, says Dr. Décary.
The situation was disconcerting.
The effort to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years followed, has given a confidence to the public.
Dr Décary however believes "confidence is something extremely fragile".
From its beginning on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
The time was when human form of mad cow disease started to appear in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, according to the scientist who has been holding the fort since 1998.
However, we do not know if the disease could be transmitted through blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which when we are unsure and when serious illness may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, characterised by degeneration of the brain leading to death, one establishes an excluded action.
In April 1999, blood of people who have spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
The disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle was applied that was appropriate.
In 1999, a new technique appeared that was much more sensitive for HIV testing: nucleic acid testing (NAT) allowed to detect directly in donated blood the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus, which is what previous tests used.
The TAN helped shorten the silent period, which runs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
It was able to reduce that period to less than a week.
It has substantially reduced the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
This improved risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusion has been reduced.
Today, a person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV contaminated blood.
In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Quebec each year distributes around 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years to a case of HIV transmission through blood products occur.
Since I have become a healthcare advocate, I believe that now we can feel at ease when receiving or prescribing blood transfusion to recover our health.
Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
One never knows what disease will emerge in the system.
Chikungunya virus, like West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in blood.
Always be vigilant, Dr. Décary says, emphasizing that in addition to secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide them in sufficient quantities.
"Demand is increasing as the population ages.
The treatments being more aggressive, patients often require refill in red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which includes an average of only 3% of Quebecers who are eligible to donate blood.
Any healthy person, aged 18 and over, meets the suitability criteria to give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
Averagely, 14% of those who offer blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, and if they have travelled to a country with malaria, they would be excluded for one year.
With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
The network of donors must be re-established as they get older and cannot donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give blood, but even more so to attract them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Because life is so fast, there is rarely time to give blood to someone.
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, Héma-Québec provides blood products, but also tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
This tissue is analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which manages the only bank of placental blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is full of rich blood stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the banking of the 1000th sample of placental cord blood and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year.
The first transplants should start in the beginning of next year, says Dr. Décary.
"Many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access it" because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact has qualified for the semi-final round of the playoffs for the first division of USL, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in total goals) over the Seattle Sounders, in the second and decisive game of the series quarter-finals on total goals at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute on Thursday.
After a first half with no aim, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Planentino marked the net of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only successful defender to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the series round, on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impacts will have to meet the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
Following the return match at Minnesota, Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit to win 4-3, but Whitecaps remained in the semi-final round 5-4 on total goals.
Impact will face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In Brief – Kovalev's victorious aim
The Canada number one trio is ready for the season.
The team consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack for a Canada victory of 3-2 in the shootout against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first meeting's winner, has scored a goal, Plekanec has raised two aides and Kovalev has collected a pass in this win, the first of six preparedness games.
Kovalev took the victory by scoring the only goal of the shootout.
"I am not yet ready," warned Russia.
I need another match to feel at ease.
"He tried to do too much in the first period, Guy Carbonneau added.
The match ended very well.
The audience was very friendly.
Charest placed on the North.
The Prime Minister is not excluded from calling for an election before the end of the year.
Once the general council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest yesterday visited Jean-Talon, Quebec City, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in the by-election today.
Breaking the limits of our last great northern frontier: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the annual General Council of the Liberal Party of Canada, in Levis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, a kind of mill of images was projected.
Rotate in a loop on three large screens, were dramatic pictures of hydroelectric dams, mining developments in Quebec seen through "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Like the mass media during elections.
Moreover, as a point to note, the Prime Minister has refused to exclude that he may call elections this fall, although he pointed to his busy schedule.
North Plan is the fourth part of a "vision" for Quebec, which includes a contract with France, a contract with Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
The North - the north territory to the 49th parallel - has never been mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches.
The Prime Minister however explained why North was "a jewel with a huge potential", but never given it the proper chance, investment money, or specific priority in future projects.
At most, there are few avenues that can be further developed: hydropower, forest, but most of the entire mining sector, boosted by growth in emerging countries and reconstruction of public infrastructure.
North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds" according to Mr. Charest.
This territory is twice the size of France", " it is here with us, it is in Quebec.
It is not only with us, but it is also with us.
The province has built much by its relationship with North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
We, our future," he added after a theatre pause contemplating the huge map behind him.
North, 70% of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Canada has always claimed.
This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border along which no agreement has been for too long and I will repeat this position there on behalf of government.
Then, "with the climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North", he declared, referring to the Northwest Passage, which is open throughout the year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupation of the territory a duty.
The territory’s citizens, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government would be very careful with them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member Ungava PQ) have already started consultations with thirty communities.
The interministerial committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place, started work.
The Prime Minister has not exclude holding a big meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a time when we give ourselves a common vision.
Northern development would also be consistent with the principles of sustainable development.
North will be "coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment", he promise.
Jean Charest describes this "vision" as consistent with that of the previous Liberal Prime Minister.
As the Liberals who preceded us, we have alternatively thought to transform challenges into opportunities for growth and development.
This has been one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was launched Friday with a grand cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival at the head of the party.
One of the proposed resolutions to rename the Central Beauharnois Dam in Adélard-Godbout.
”From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has managed to build the future”, says Jean Charest.
In the press briefing, he invoked another reference, conservative as this, the program "Roads to North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
The proposed hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper is expected to be operational in 2012.
'I plan to be there, but I plan to be there', he told activists, which drew a huge applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who announced in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this fall, as the law permits him.
The Secretary stressed that his schedule is filled, including a mission to the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform for the nationalist resolutions, including some "constitutional aspirations" that went through like a shuttle: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the specificity of Quebec in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Board and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the outline of the Northern Plan was received with scepticism.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois has taken up again the policy development of Northern Quebec that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came into power in 2003, had waived the application.
If it were done, "it would be more advanced today," commented Ms Marois, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (ballot which takes place today).
The ADQ has supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
The goal is to not be simply for show, added Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returned from vacation today.
Letters - A country dishonored
It is Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
The casting of opprobrium on a woman who led a struggle for justice and who deserves our admiration also speaks volumes about the entourage of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
Here, we have a government that is the only one of all western countries not to have repatriated its nationals locked in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the crimes for which he is charged.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has gone back on his word and let a child soldier languish in inhuman conditions.
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Remember, for record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association have called for the return of Omar Khadr to Canada so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
This same government does not look at torture, and little does it matter to it that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, doubtlessly forever, after so many years of abuses.
One does not yet realize, but we are witnessing a growing erosion of our rights, of our liberties, and our "democracy" word, which Harper continues to use and that sounds empty in his mouth.
The time is now when no more morals are available: one can bully, torture, arbitrarily detain a Canadian citizen at the whim of a minor government so far (so what will happen after 14 October ...).
The majority of voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law, and Order.
shame, Mr Toews, it is here, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Barrick Gold.
The story is based on an Orwellian logic, which states that the largest gold company in the world brought six million defamation suits against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, especially in defamation cases, they do not seek to find the truth but to follow the law.
It is unexpected that this difference is completely obscured by Mr Garver.
Since, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct public debate is to ruin anyone who dare to support a contrary position.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Black Canada will have to spend considerable money preparing their defence and fight, with very unequal resources, against a army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining.
The tactics, in such unequal fighting, are often to ruin the defendants with the aim of imposing a settlement that silences the opposition and also fears any who might consider reopening the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public it should have presented its vision of the facts.
In contrast to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, Canada debate is normally based on ideas and not on baton thumps.
Then, it would have been sufficient for the mining company to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and fund independent research teams.
The company appears to be not trusting public opinion and rejected out of hand petitions and letter of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Maybe Mr Garver could explain how he can both call for a "public" debate without taking into account the views of that same audience?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems to refer to highly priced lawyers and not to all Canadians: that is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even the critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not - or will not - understand is that the public which supports the writers and publishers of Black Canada, does so primarily because it rejects its brutal mining methods.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge but on the basis of civilised exchange of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution-gag (continued in the public debate, Barrick Gold has also filed a notice against the authors of Black Canada demanding them to cease using the term ...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential for any democratic society.
It does not deny the right to quote from credible sources and to discuss the fact and interpretations, which represent the core of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects unpalatable to the wealthy corporations in a country like Canada, under the penalty of repeated prosecution, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has the right to respond.
The academia, to which we belong, has long been managing the debates and disagreements, and resolving conflicts.
Barrick Gold enormous pursuit clearly shows that contrary to its claims, it did not want transparency.
It is a loss for academia, as well for public debate in Canada, and it is time to establish devices that limit such illegal practices.
Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republican and Democrats, finally agreed on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion U.S. dollar plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it includes: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed, new provisions to limit the number of houses seized for non-payment, and a right to look at the salaries paid to executives of rescued companies.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news at midnight yesterday.
The agreement has been a great progress towards an effective agreement on the market, according to the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street.
The fundamental point is if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on American citizens will be immense.
The negotiations turned into a sprint in the final hours fearing the effect of another failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline we had given was the opening of the markets this morning.
Associated late to the negotiations, the two American presidential candidates were quite supportive to the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction that one is compelled to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has asked for addition of some provisions in the agreement, particularly those that allow owners to keep their homes and ones on the wages of leaders of rescued enterprises.
When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of some irresponsibility, there is no congratulations.
However, these measures are necessary, he added on the airwaves of American television.
When asked by another channel whether he will vote for the proposed plan, he replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
The outline I read shows that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we can go forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable", he said.
The plan of 700 billion is aimed at buying with the money of taxpayers bad debts, risk assets and unsellable US financial institutions.
It follows a 14 month crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprime), before spreading to other forms of widespread credit titles (PCAA), leading to a freeze of liquidity and the stampede of banks and financial institutions.
This is a group of elected Republicans who had derailed the first draft draft last week.
The debate has been resolved since the Democrats have agreed that certain "toxic" shares of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
To round up the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision has been added stipulating that if the government had to take loss for five years because of this program, it could introduced new taxes to recover its investment.
The new plan includes a first tranche of 250 billion, which can be added if the President deems necessary.
The other payment of 350 billion has to be endorsed by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for its support, Washington will get shares in the companies it has rescued, earning dividends in case of profits and that it can sell when the storm has passed.
The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the seizure of housing attached to mortgage loans under this plan and to set limits on compensation and severance packages paid to executives of affected companies.
The architects of the plan want to see it voted on today in the House of Representatives and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, it is still uncertain that they will get the green light.
voices have indeed been rising against the project yesterday, both in the Republican camp and in the Democrat camp.
'Washington does not hear you', said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, solutions exist.
However, not those that take advantage of taxpayers.
The leader of a small group in Congress called the Sceptics' Caucus, the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently but reaches the same conclusion.
'Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: one asks the Congress not to rush and to consider the way forward'.
At the same time, Europe has once again proved the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis group for 11.2 billion Euro (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has announced that it will renounce acquiring its rival in full bankruptcy after it has lost 2 billion Euro (2.9 billion US).
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
This is not lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
In return we get the right to vote with the bank and some influence.
It is just something that investors and households appreciate now that uncertain times are ahead.
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the UK government seems to be planning to nationalize another bank hit by the financial crisis.
The government will endorse all outstanding loans in Bradford and Bingley, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander has announced yesterday that it will acquire branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bingley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the UK government will have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a true icon
The beauty and blue eyes were for a long time his main asset, some would say his weakness.
How did he free himself from this narcissistic mirror, this American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
The modesty, his sensitiveness and abundance of talent would have also distanced him from the power register which produces real sacred monsters.
What a great runner to the end!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, aged 83, as a result of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema from the years of splendid glamour.
Less monumental than Brando, who he re-evolved and was a long time sort of rival on screen, more sensitive in his game, certainly more fragile but also an advocate of freedom and the breaking of traditional dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood children are often magnificent.
The singer was born in Ohio in 1925 from a Jewish German father and mother of Hungary origin.
From these European roots were born the glorious faces of American dream.
With no ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because in him is portrayed a country-loving self made man, who in the early 50's studied drama at Yale and attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before winning at the theater, on television, and soon after at the cinema.
The same man who took civil rights took the second place in the 24 Hours Le Mans in 1979, doubled as a sex symbol, albeit a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappearing with him are the secret areas of this secret star, very secretive, committed, without being sensitive to the scandals of the show business, which have certainly not penetrated the enigma.
An honest man in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused a shock to moviegoers this weekend, while his major roles collide on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of seventh American art, which is constantly changing scrolls through him.
The ones that remain in memories are the gorgeous cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), and the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958).
Close to us (1990) evokes his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfil all its promises.
Many other Paul Newman have gone into history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, deliquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, taken after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly crook in the most brilliant The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
The Hustler was a vengeful and vengeful player in The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), and in 1987 he took up the role again in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who in 1987 won him the only Oscar with nine nominations.
This face throughout the ages was him.
Him again.
Early eras wander through his journey.
The young people know him mainly through the cult of Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
The fans visited him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen Brothers.
With a last role as the godfather of an Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
The legendary Newman has remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its splendor and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, as a living challenge to underplaying "judging his performance too supportive.
The profession has not always been easy with the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom roles have been easy as pie.
The most common character in his first young roles was neurotics, alcoholics or desperately hungry men, with his perfect traits reflecting the excesses and the rebellious.
As Director, Newman revealed a little known aspect of his modest real sensitivity.
The Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
The latter died to an overdose, to whom he dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, out of decency and sadness.
The rain of tributes that fell on Newman yesterday was a heavy rain of tribute to his friend and fellow fellow in arms Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting, and Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid).
Generosity, life-long love are the features of the brilliant actor who has gone.
Beyond his legendary career, erased was a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, and a protester against the excessive Hollywood excesses.
The mugshots were on a lot of jars of salad dressing, sauces, biscuits, and other foodstuffs, which we judge as tasteless, but a gag at the outset.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for children in difficulties.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, has remained committed to his work until the end.
The letter contains the words: "Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good fortune.
It has been a privilege to be there.
The privilege of following such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and addition.
What has been produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag and his partners?
The criminal prosecution of János Zuschlag and his companions will start on 8th October.
The politician and his partners have been accused of continuously and professionally participating in a fraud causing significant damage, as well in other criminal activities, including forgery.
According to the prosecution, they used the tender fund for their own purposes and often certified the performance of tasks by fake invoices.
The state and municipal funds - HUF 65 million - have been divided between the organization Fiatal Baloldal and other people.
The methodology - which has been published by the investigating authority - was to use unreal costs to access the tender funds. This way the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
Most of the invoices were false according to the indictment.
The invoice templates were acquired in Józsefváros market and the round stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
The selection of the companies in the name of which the bills were issued was carried out on a trip in western Hungary, where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The testimony of the second one says that he was ordered to select pensions and restaurants.
The invoice was prepared from the invoice prepared by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Budapest Municipal Council.
The reports were mainly submitted by István Lados and his companion, András Őri, who was responsible for writing the reports required to qualify for support.
One of Lados's "study visits" was to a beer-house.
The invoice dated 2003 was issued by Zuschlag and his companions, and the establishment provided food for a group of 90 people, who were members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, as the company’s Director states, the establishment does not have the capacity to provide seats for such a large number of people.
The invoice submitted in summer 2002 to the fund called Jobb Jövőért - later renamed to Together for the Third Millennium - also contained several misspellings in its form and content.
The bill was issued for the accommodation of 130 guests in a 3-room pension in Badacsonytomaj, which had the maximum capacity of providing place for ten people.
The imagination of the invoices went too far when they mentioned Pigal Kft. in the documents, which is a catering company but its accounting - according to the information provided to the accusation authority - did not include documents of the foundations Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, Director of the firm told hvg.hu that when he was summoned and the invoices were shown to him, he recognised the false nature of the invoices immediately.
"The name and tax number of our company was incorrectly placed on the stamp.
The invoice was issued for 100 persons, despite the fact that they only had 11 rooms, which do not have the capacity for so many people.
In addition, the bill included catering, though the restaurant was not in operation for long.
The enthusiastic billmakers were not aware of the fact that the Budapest-based travel agency organizes only foreign tours, thus the indicated Hungary transport as a service category was not consistent with the firm’s invoice issuing practice.
Additionally, - as it has been discovered during the investigation - they also included VAT on the document despite the fact that the transport activities to other European countries were exempted from VAT.
The VAT level, which is shown in four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, was also incorrect since the firm’s service should have been increased by VAT of 15%, instead of the indicated 25%.
The invoice-issuers made another mistake when they listed road transport of goods as performed activity - which turned out during the prosecution procedure.
The fake nature of the bills issued to Together for the 3rd Millennium Alapítvány, XXI. Százdi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont was disclosed due to formal deviations such as inappropriate billing format and forged stamp.
Similarly in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sport Camp, the representatives of which denied having issued the bills.
The forgers did not even mention that the Nyíregyháza based HIB Kft was under liquidation at the time when a group from Fiatal Városokért Egyesület allegedly had lunch there. The insolvency practitioner denied having issued the document.
Thoughtfully given
Other group of invoice-issuers consists of those who have been aware of issuing fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esperanza Budapestért Alapítvány issued a invoice of about four million forints for the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták. This invoice was issued to the foundation Together for the 3rd Century.
The indictment states that the Director of Collab Kft. was encouraged by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to prepare a fictitious invoice.
Biogate Kft. - currently under liquidation - also cooperated with Zuschlag and his companions. In 2003 the company provided the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with invoices of around HUF 5 million with no real economic activity.
There was no cash flow either since the invoices were void later, but the organizations forgot to mention this in their documents.
Next category of the firms having issued the invoices are those linked to the defendants.
Iván Kubatov, the delivery representative of the Ukrainian Executive Director of Delta Trió Kft, having its headquarters in Budapest but not to be found there, which deals with fuel and vehicle trade.
In October, November and December the company issued several calls for selling computing devices, approximately HUF 18 million.
The data of the investigation shows that the bills were purchased by the Kiskunhalas-based Cash Investment Kft., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The Executive Director of the above mentioned company was a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov was supposed to send the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov reportedly issued bills to Atlasz, Hoppá and Together for the Second Extinction Alapítvány and received the amounts paid.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romania masons, specifically at the request of Iván Kubatov.
However, no of these firms operated actually, which the defendant explained by lack of orders.
However, he could take advantage of these opportunities, as attorney Zsolt Szente - who prepared the company founding documents as well - issued accounts in his name for the associations which are associated with Zuschlag, namely for Atlasz and Y-Generation.
Kubatov provided 15 invoices for the organizations in the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, with a total value of HUF 14.2 million.
According to the prosecution, 10% of the amount indicated on the invoices and the VAT was the share of Kubatov.
The latter also asked Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fake tickets for Biztos Pont.
In January 2006 Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a tender to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a non-profit organization of the socialist party.
The amount was awarded HUF 500.000 each, but the amount was not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order to prevent the fraud being disclosed, they sent the 5 fictitious invoices issued by Works Team Kft. to TMA.
This notice was found - during the search - in Árpád Kemecsei's office in the Education Ministery.
Some defendants are likely to confess about the process of the invoice production - as they did at the Attorney's Department.
The most interesting part of the situation could be János Zuschlag's decision to disclose his secrets.
The testimony so far is not very detailed, and though he promised to provide information on all areas of the case, he has not done so.
The question is whether he is interested in fulfilling his promise or - in return for the full refund of most of the damage (50 million forints) the socialists have negotiated a deal with him and he would rather take the rap.
Maybe he took offence since his requests for improvement of the conditions of his detention - in other words his house arrest - kept falling on deaf ears.
While those who have committed the much more serious and non-compensated economic criminal activities can walk freely in the street or wait at home for the end of the legal procedure being conducted against them, he does not have the opportunity to do that.
The psychology of overbidding: what do we spend more money on?
At an auction, they tend to spend more money on a product and overvalue it.
The neurologist and economist researchers of New York University have successfully revealed the neurological-economic basis of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in a competition like eBay, so they usually pay an unrealistic price.
The research aim to map the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
The group of volunteers was playing lottery and another group participated in an auction. In the meantime, the active brain area of the experimenters was examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
The participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auction game - in which overbidding the other person plays a major role - the striatum complex, located under the brain cortex, was starting to work upon the person's defeat.
This area of the brain - aside its other functions - plays a role in the self-rewarding mechanism of the nervous system.
The reason for raising the price is based on the avoidance of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In order to justify their theory, the research group conducted financial research as well.
In this research three groups were making bids against someone, under different conditions.
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the certain product and they made their bids.
Other groups received a promise of a further $15 in case of victory.
The third group was provided by 15 dollars before the auction but in case of defeat they would lose this amount.
As a result, the only difference between the two groups was the focus on victory or defeat.
According to the neurologists, the members of the group "playing for not losing money" were ready to make higher bids than the control group or the group "playing for gaining money".
"These results cannot be deducted from any existing economic theory.
The earlier theory explained the phenomenon at auctions by the pleasure of victory and risk avoidance.
The neurological imaging methods helped us to dissolve the contradiction between the two theories in a way that we got to a third explanation at the end.
Hepatitis: when should we turn to a doctor?
Around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection. In Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned as the main cause of death.
Although the number of Hungarians being infected by hepatitis can reach 100 000, only 7 000 of them are properly treated.
Hepatitis is a collective name of different infectious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
Although there are similar symptoms, such as liver inflammation or jaundice, the nature of the pathogens and the causing diseases is different.
Hepatitis viruses are transmitted in two main forms, depending on the type of the pathogens: hepatitis A and E travel through the food tract (e.g. infected food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses are carried in blood and body fluids (semen, vagina mucus, saliva).
The people who travel often should protect themselves against A and B viruses by vaccination; but there is no vaccination against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear 2–3 weeks after having eaten contaminated food; they are accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal problems, nausea.
The next sign is jaundice appearing on the skin and in the white part of the eye. Additional symptoms include light coloured faeces, dark urine. Recovery can take 2–3 weeks.
Each year and worldwide, 1 million people die of the more serious form of the disease, hepatitis B, causing liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason is that only about one-tenth of the infected receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also lead to serious problems: cirrhosis of theliver or liver cancer if not treated.
Most infected are not even aware of their disease as the pathogens destroy the liver cells over a long period of time, and in many cases the first symptoms emerge 20 or 30 years later.
From this point, early prevention, especially regular screening tests have fundamental significance.
In three groups this illness is highly above average: among people who have received blood transfusion before 1991, drug-addicts and tattoos.
Currently, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C is around 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease can be recognised by routine laboratory testing, it is worth seeing a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin occur.
In case of early recognition, the disease can be cured, the virus can be destroyed, thus the infection stops and cancer can be prevented.
World Hepatitis Day was first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the infected.
It aims to call attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, the causes of its induction and the significance of early recognition.
Does it hurt less if you believe in God?
According to recent research, religion can be used as a painkiller, which could have reduced the death of catholic martyrs.
The Oxford University scientists carried out an interesting experiment about the influence of believing in God on people's sensitivity to pain, says the British Telegraph.
In the framework of this highly bizarre experiment 12 catholic believers and 12 atheists were given electric shock. In the meantime all of them were studying a painting of Virgin Mary.
The results showed that the practising Catholics were able to exclude most of their pain.
The brain scanning technology proved that Catholics were able to activate the brain part responsible for pain regulation.
This was the first experiment in a series of research, which also included scientists, philosophers, theologians from different departments of the university.
The volunteers in the experiment took a sparking object providing electric shock.
The researchers asked the experimental subjects to thoroughly study two paintings; Sassoferrato's Virgin Mary from 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine from 15th century.
The researchers expected that - seeing the picture of Virgin Mary - the believers would enter a sort of religious state.
The volunteers spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and received 20 electric shocks within four sequential time periods, while they were looking at one of the above mentioned paintings.
The Catholics described the situation as safe and protecting, which made them "relaxed and peaceful".
12 percent less pain was reported while the experimental subjects were studying the religious painting - compared to the feeling they experienced when they saw Leonardo's work.
According to Miguel Farias, who participated in the experiment, similar effect can be produced by any painting with strong emotional influence on the person, even among atheists.
They should look for a picture of someone they feel very positive about, like mother or father.
The research was acknowledged by the Anglican bishop Tom Wright.
"Practicing faith should change and often changes our personality", he added.
After these great results the question now is how Leonardo's or another highly appreciated painter's picture of Madonna would influence the belief system?
What would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You are what you share.
On its 10th birthday Google can admit: It is in the pocket of people, as well as above their head, in the sky.
Inspite all that, Eric Schmidt, the key person of the company is still not satisfied.
The sceptics who bring it in parallel with Orwell's dreadful fantasy simply cannot see the essence of web 2.0.
The main goal of Google was to collect more personal information about users.
The company is still at the start of its road towards the ability to treat all the information.
When asked about his plans for the next 5 years he asked Google to respond to questions like "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What type of job suits me best?". However, software cannot give the right answers to these seemingly simple questions because the available user information is not sufficient.
All Internet users are aware of the fact that the terms searched by them are recorded, as well as the IP address used for the search and the pages they visit afterwards.
The 2-year-old Personalized Search function will allow users to review what they were looking for, what links they clicked on before. In the long term, it will provide users with personalized results.
What happens if my personal data are used against me, if it is discovered what I do?
It is usually the degree of the potential power represented by the company that generates counter reaction in users, not guilt, fear of punishment, freedom or rebellion against authority.
However, it has been confirmed that all the searched terms are recorded and - where appropriate - can be transferred to third parties. In such cases no protection is provided for the privacy of Internet users.
The best example of that is the concerted action against some Brazilian paedophiles, which Google sent to the government some information from one of its social networking pages, called Orkut. The data supplied helped the government identify several paedophiles.
The users who were concerned about the invasion of personal privacy were relief in May when Google - in association with EEF electronic legal aid organization - successfully proved his right to provide any secretly requested information.
(However, - referring to the confirmation of the child protection law approved several years earlier - the federal government managed to acquire 50 000 web address and 1 000 search terms, but it could not acquire the individual users' search lists, nor a complete list of web pages and keywords for two months.)
The debate is arising on Google, which is attacked by people who fear giving out their personal data because they feel that their private life would be reduced by using Google services.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild oat including computer fans, activists, users in several countries consider them the next generation of large companies, a "cool corporation", despite the fact that they fight for the same goal.
The reasons for this can be that Google - unlike Microsoft - does not require identification from its users and money for the applications.
Maybe it is because geeks can accurately see the problem of personal privilege and Internet, which is defined by the most frequently discussed key expression of the last few years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about intentional leave traces about our computer activities and exploit the available communication channels.
The average young person can open a profile on various public pages such as Facebook or Xanga, linking them to other services like Twitter or last.fm, then those can be linked to a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
The story is a few examples of such stories: the girl - checking the many photos uploaded in the morning by common friends - discovers where her untrustworthy boyfriend spent his previous night.
If someone lives in an online life, they are what they show of themselves - this is the core concept behind the behaviour of today's young people.
If someone has something to keep secret or if someone simply wants to bypass Google's monopoly, it is also possible (e.g. using Scroogle, which also applies the Google search system but purposely leaves no trace behind).
The number of intentionally not registering to social networks is significant. This way they can avoid being discovered, Google's online applications from text editor to image manager and newsreader can be replaced by alternative versions that are not connected to huge server parks and not trying to create our best profile ever.
General public is looking forward to seeing what is still hidden by Google.
The company - with its value of USD 156 billion - is worth more than IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion).
However, the management rejected the employee's objection, which started when the company's kindergarten was doubled. The daily canteen - which was allowed at any time and even several times - was also considered too costly by the management.
The company’s internal regulations says that new services must not be advertised in advance, but only when they are ready to be used.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can provide a foundation for future sci-fi writers.
The murderer of two was assisted by two minors in hiding the traces in Ózd.
The police interrogated two minors about the double homicide committed in Ózd. There are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they assisted the murderer in hiding the traces of the crime, says the main police station in Borsod County.
The two young people admitted to having committed the mentioned act, and are currently accused of aiding and abetting.
The two minors - 2 girls, according to the information provided by MTI - answer to the large charges.
Aiding and abetting can be punished by a minimum of 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double homicide in Ózd - a 23-year-old local man - was taken to preliminary custody on Sunday.
The accused is accused of deliberate death against several people for the purpose of gain.
The investigation revealed that the young man owed significant money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect was not planning to pay back the debt, so he took his creditor to a suburban establishment in Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
The young man was determined to commit the crime, which is evidenced by the fact that he previously had hidden a gun at the premises for this purpose.
The police is examining the gun and crime conditions with experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted a bid to acquire the Prague Stock Exchange.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million - approximately 5 billion Czech korunas - for 100% ownership of the Prague shares.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the bid that has been taken by the Polish, despite the fact that Czech Republic previously excluded Warsaw Stock Exchange from the group of potential owners of the Prague shares.
The reason for this is that Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
99 percent of the stake is in the ownership of the Polish government, which plans to sell 60 percent of the paper in the next few months.
The best bid for Prague shares was given by the Polish.
The information provided by the Czech newspapers, offers have been received from the transatlantic exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
According to Petr Koblic, Director of the Prague Stock Exchange, the worst option was the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the selection of which would result in the cessation of the Prague bourse.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange shares is estimated at 5–10 billion korunas by market experts.
The agreement among the shareholders means that 90 percent of the shares can be acquired.
The most important shareholding is in the hands of the owner of Patria Finance investment bank, having approximately 25 percent of the stake. It is followed by the Czech Spare Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.s.
About the financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
The European newspapers were describing the ever-deepening international financial crisis as a second September 11th.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - says the Rome-based La Repubblica - the president was not even able to get his own party back up the hastily prepared bill, which is supposed to resolve the situation.
It is not a new Pearl Harbor, as Warren Buffett billionaire investor described it, but a second September 11th.
Some Madrid press also blame Washington for the situation.
The collapse of the world economy is due to lack of political leadership in the USA.
The American financial system is at growing risk of collapse, which will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, now - after the congressional vote - the threatening risk is if Washington does not provide any political tool to handle the crisis.
World economy is hanging in the air - just at the time when the most important transformation of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any more, says the Tages-Anzeiger from Geneva.
Some countries still have the capacity to provide life-belt for the weakened financial institutions and can save them from bankruptcy by the money of the taxpayers.
However, if further banks collapse, as in domino-effect, no funds nor new improvisations will help.
What we need in the long term is that the European Union members shall determine themselves to overcome their own national selfishness and centralize the control over the divided financial markets.
The aid distributed on Monday to the ailing financial institutes was more than 100 billion euros, adding that European taxpayers will also have to dig into their pockets to remedy the situation.
The EU has not paid special attention to the crisis so far, which is now sweeping through the old continent as a tsunami.
The "savers" do not expect to wave 100 billion euros in their hands right at the start but it is important to identify situations when the taxpayers' money is needed to prevent more serious damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flying of a bumblebee
What could be better way to advance the development of crash prevention technology than mimicking nature's obstacle detectors?
Examine bees, for example!
In a surprising project being developed at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebee has given Nissan engineers a strategic hint on how to design the next generation of crash-avoidance systems.
Based on joint research with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C-type Biomimatic Car Robot Drive. It is a robotic micro-car that recreates bee characteristics with the goal of producing a system that prevents collisions.
Each bee creates its own personal space, which is closely related to our safety shield.
The complex structure of bees' eye plays a major role, which allows bees to see all directions at an angle of 300 degrees.
In order to recreate the function of a compound eye, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser rangefinder.
This device detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to them and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is instantly translated into collision avoidance.
It takes a fraction of seconds to detect an obstacle, and the car robot instantly changes direction mimicking the movements of a bee by turning its wheels at the angle needed to prevent a collision.
One of the main differences from any current system is that the avoidance manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If that is not so, the robot car would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles, says Toshiyuki Andoh, manager of Nissan's Mobility Lab and principal engineer of the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly because this technology is the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, a layer where a crash is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must mirror what a bee does to avoid other bees.
It must happen in a blink of an eye.
It cannot shift upwards or downwards or diagonally, only in two dimension and only in the direction that the wheels can turn.
Instead of the infinite number of ways a bumblebee can avoid other bees, only the rotation function, the acceleration and deceleration have been used as available means of collision avoidance.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which - compared to the lithium-ion version - ensures longer lifetime.
Andoh believes that the most important thing is the intelligent instinctive reaction, not the capability for data processing and storage.
The device is supposed to process only a few inputs per second and react accordingly.
The intuitive logic is not necessary to store inputs and react by the intuitive logic based on previously manoeuvring data, so it uses continuously only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabyte or megabyte size memory.
This is the first step of developing the instant collision avoidance technology that, on the basis of Nissan's estimate, can be built into series-produced cars within 10 years.
If connecting the device to the GPS satellite navigation system, an additional application option can be worked out to help prevent road barriers while driving.
A name granted to the expensive child
The draft version of the bill on the 700 billion dollar economic bailout package has been drawn.
In the first round, half of the amount is planned to be spent.
"Following the further reconcilations having ended on Saturday night, East Coast time, the Congress managed to agree on the 700 billion dollar bailout package", the Reuters confirmed.
Nancy Pelosi, democratic chairwoman of the House of Representatives, added that the only thing needed was to work out the written form of the agreement.
The compromise on the package has been supported by both presidential candidates, Obama and John McCain.
The results of the compromise, Henry Paulson, Treasury Secretary, declared: The programme is well and going to be efficient, but further steps are still needed.
The written form of the package was published at 8 pm on Sunday, Washington time, at the opening time of Asian markets (at 2 am in Central Europe).
The draft legislation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will be presented on Monday in the House of Representatives, secondly in the Senate.
When President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, the news of the agreement was welcomed in the White House.
Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House, said.
The programme differs from the proposal being first submitted by the Bush administration with the aim of spending the 700 billion dollars on purchasing low quality mortgage-backed securities.
The first round of the $700 billion will be used in a way that USD 250 billion will instantly be used for buying low quality mortgage-backed securities.
The programme will be supervised by a separate body with the involvement of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The rest of the 700 billion dollars will be decided by the Congress.
According to the law, the Treasury Secretary is entitled to use a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other "poisonous" credits.
The purchase can be realized on auctions or in direct way, according to the Treasury.
The legislation allows the concerned companies to participate in an insurance programme where the worrisome assets will be guaranteed by the Treasury and the companies will pay fees equivalent to the expected damages.
According to the law, the required assets are provided according to the situation, either by widespread purchase of bad assets or by insurance of those, or even prevention of system risk caused by the collapse of some major financial institutes.
Arrangements will be made to prepare for the implementation of the law as soon as it has been signed.
The directors of troubled banks waiting for state aid should expect that their severance - which is simply called golden parachute in the overseas slang - will be restricted by the government.
The restriction of payments is introduced in certain cases only, limitations depend on the nature of the support provided by the Treasury.
Regulation means that if the Treasury acquires on auction, a surtax is imposed on the golden parachute, unless the ruined bank director is sent to retirement.
In order to buy bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the amount of managerial money is not exaggerated.
The existing golden parachute contracts will not be changed, restriction shall only be applied to the new contracts in order to encourage participation in the programme.
The first time in American history that legal restrictions will be imposed on the remuneration of chief executive officers, according to House Financial Service Committee Chairman Barney Frank of the Democratic Party.
The government will be conferred with the right to hold the acquisition, which will reduce the risk of loss as both the economy and the recovered bank recover.
The bill includes that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress within 5 years, which specifies how the expected losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector.
Critics also voiced their doubts about the plan on both sides.
This is not what American citizens expect from us, this will not protect taxpayers' money.
The Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur declared the arrangements have been encouraged by the same people who caused the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices keep growing
"Industrial domestic sales prices of August 2008 rose by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared with August 2007 figures", KSH reports.
In relation to the data of July 2008, industrial export sales prices were 1.1 percent higher than in the previous year.
The domestic and export price changes resulted in a higher increase of 0.7 percent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 percent compared to the figures recorded one year earlier.
Industrial domestic sales prices showed a growth of only 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales of the manufacturing industry increased only by 0.1 percent compared to the figures of July.
In August 2008 the biggest increase in the leather, footwear manufacturing industry (2.8 percent), due to the 4.6 percent price increase in bag and strap production and the 2.5 percent monthly price increase in footwear production.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical materials is responsible for a significant monthly increase in the prices of chemical materials and products (1.6 percent).
The prices decreased in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in the production of electric machines, tools (0.9 percent), and - to a minimal extent - in wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors of the manufacturing industry the price increase was between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
The prices in electricity, gas, steam and water supply, which play a major role in domestic industrial sales, rose by 0.3 percent, mainly due to the widely influenced gas price increase, introduced by the authorities on 1st July.
According to the last 12 months’ figures - considering domestic sales of manufacturing sectors - the highest price increase (32.4 percent) was observed in crude oil processing.
In metal processing a price increase of 13.2 percent, in food, beverage, tobacco production 11 percent growth was seen.
Prices fell in clothing and textile articles production (2.5 percent), as well in the production of electric machines, apparatus (0.3 percent).
The rate of price growth was between 0.6 percent and 9.1 percent in the rest of the manufacturing industries.
Prices in the whole manufacturing industry increased by 10.2 percent in the last 12 months.
Electricity, gas, steam and water supply prices exceeded the previous year’s figures by 18.7 percent.
According to domestic sales within the destinations, the highest monthly growth rate of August was experienced in the sectors producing capital goods.
Prices went up by 0.3 percent in consumer goods industry, while in the energy sector and in the sectors for further use no changes have been observed compared with the previous month.
In August 2008 the highest price growth occurred in the energy sector and in the sectors producing for further use (16.7 percent).
6% increase in prices was seen in the sectors producing consumer goods and 1.4 percent decrease in prices in those handling capital goods.
Forint-based industrial export sales in August rose by 1.1 percent compared with the previous month and decreased by 3.9 percent related to the past twelve months.
Our national currency weakened by 1.7 percent to the Euro, and by 7.1 percent to the dollar as of August 2007. The forint strengthened by 7.5 percent to the Euro, but it strengthened by 15.9 percent against the dollar as of August 2007.
No VISA needed to USA from Next Year?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is good chance that the American-Hungarian agreement on visa exemption will take effect around 12th January, when the minister held a speech before the local Hungarian leaders.
The WHO added that "everything depends on whether the electronic access control system will be used overseas in time".
The spokeswoman pointed to the fact that although there is no entry permit, tourists will have to register before travel.
The head of the Hungary diplomacy is meeting in Washington from today.
The meeting is with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is giving the Middle Cross of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and meeting with the foreign affairs consultants of the presidential candidates Obama, Democratic Party and John McCain, Republican Party.
Both Obama and McCain support the bank rescue package
Both Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates of both main American parties, confirmed on Sunday to support the government's 700 billion dollar bank rescue package, but politicians are calling for the Treasury secretary to resign.
After several days of marathon negotiations, the Congress and government representatives announced Sunday that they have reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at rendering the frozen credit market have become central issues of the campaign.
Both Obama and McCain seem to act in a way to prove that he is more suitable than his rival to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, due to the economic issues which have come into the foreground, Obama has gained some advantage, while McCain's lead position - that he acquired after the Republican convention - has now melted.
Obama expressed his hope at a campaign gathering in Detroit on the fast approval of the act on the 700 billion dollar package.
The proposal also included consumer protection passages that he had supported.
'We must act now, with responsibility', he added in front of a crowd of 35 000 people.
The economist failed to ignore the chance to describe McCain's economic concepts as outdated.
McCain told ABC that "this is a situation that will take long for all of us to digest, but doing nothing is simply unaffordable".
The Republican senator declared that the proposal included setting up a committee supervising the treasury secretary and restricting the severance of top leaders.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no essential role in the reconciliations, but he had been in daily contact with the secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Chairwoman of the House of Representatives provided the information that the House of Representatives was expected to vote on the bill on Monday.
News From German Papers
The right wing is untouched, only the group’s voters have become more self-conscious - The Spiegel analyses the weakness of CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his party are ready to govern Austria in order to avoid red-black coalition.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article The Bavarian revolution is eating up its parents, published in the Internet publication of the left wing news magazine.
The popular political scientist believes that the erosion of CSU started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over the office.
Christian socialists have been reforming Bavaria for long years - now these modern citizens are the ones who leave.
The start of a new era is a problem for all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The defeat did not surprise CSU but a whole process ended on Sunday, a process that had been likely to occur in the last 10 years: the cessation of the indisputable hegemony of a state party.
Eight years later, in 1998 CSU landed on 47.7 percent, the first time under 50 percent since the fifties.
It happened again 3 years ago, during the Bundestag election 2005, which was the famous Stoiber era.
The reason for it was the constant modernization carried out by CSU in the Province, which eats up its parents.
Sociologists have predicted it for 40 years but concerning its speed they were wrong.
Modernisation is a combination of opportunities and political consequences.
The left wing is untouched, only the group’s voters have become more self-conscious, critical and willful.
The most remarkable thing is that during the last weeks, mainly classical civil groups were leaving CSU; liberal professions, industrial workers, people with secondary school certificate, people with college or university degree.
CSU support here has declined to below 40 percent.
The Press (thepress.com)
"Who, with whom? Party chairmen are reserved on coalition issues" is the title of the article in which the Vienna-based conservative daily newspaper is analysing the confusing domestic political situation after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ is planning to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ to intervene in its internal issues.
BZÖ seems open to negotiate in all directions, the greens do not want to reconcile on coalition yet.
The election has already occurred, now everything is about the coalition; during the public television debate, there was no chance to gain insight into the party leaders' cards.
Werner Faymann confirmed his willingness to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ would like to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - it is present in some of the provinces as well in social partnership.
Faymann left the question of a coalition with Wilhelm Molter as vice-chancellor - currently ÖVP chairman - open.
As he says, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been rejected.
Turning to this direction again is out of question.
Molterer was careful in handling red offers.
According to him, the cooperation will not be successful if Faymann tries to intervene into the internal issues of the ÖVP.
While remaining opposition or joining a coalition is still an open question in the party, this issue is definitely to be discussed in ÖVP.
BZÖ Chairman Jörg Haider repeatedly seemed to be open to all alternatives.
In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility, according to Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty, segregation must be eliminated
The European Equality Summit has been inaugurated today in Paris, organized by France representing the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union.
In her message to the plenum, Lívia Járóka of Fidesz, Representative of the European People's Party called attention to education segregation as it is one of the most serious infringement of Roma children and as a result, it is the most important barrier to their prosperity.
The high level conference was inaugurated by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labor and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunity.
Representatives of the European government, the European social partners and the most important European legal aid and NGOs in the field of equal opportunities were invited to have a seat on the conference.
According to the press office of the Fidesz group in the EP, Roma people are segregated from the work market mainly because of low education.
Most young Roma people do not have secondary school qualification, and due to low quality of the basic education only a small percentage of them can obtain college or university degrees.
Járóka also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Early education of Roma children can contribute to strengthening the European Union Member States.
The representative believes that it is necessary to inform the widest range of people - Roma and non-Roma people as well - about these interrelationships.
The earlier a young Roma student starts school, the better their chances of being productive in the labor market.
According to the European Union citizenship right, quality education must be ensured for Roma people and low quality, segregated education must be eliminated.
The WHO also stressed that in order to instantly accelerate school desegregation, it is essential to ensure objective- and action-oriented cooperation within the European Union.
The cycle of poverty, segregation, unemployment must be eliminated, Roma children must be provided with the opportunities of democratic life so that they can participate in the future of Europe as full citizens with full rights.
In the context of the European Year of Equal Opportunity, the European Equality Summit - first organized in Berlin last year and since then held on annual basis - aims to provide a unique forum to promote equal opportunities and anti-discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: Transition Grace Period
Decision About Defeated Huber-Beckstein Duo At The End Of October
Although headaches have not yet rolled, personal issues are temporarily kept at the CSU summits.
While President, Erwin Huber and State Prime Minister, Günther Beckstein may still remain in their posts, the question is how long grace takes.
The future of the tandem, who have suffered a tragic 17 percent vote loss, will be decided by the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
However, members of the much criticised duo pictured do not insist on their seats by any means.
With this they aimed at appealing the angry members of the fraction and the basis who were claiming personal consequences for having lost clear majority one day after the "Bavarian tsunami".
The Christian Social Union - a true party led by Edmund Stoiber - had obtained 60.7 percent but now, one year after the coup, the party only reached 43.4 percent.
CSU had been "absolute ruler" in Bavaria for 46 years, providing 18 percent of German GDP.
Although conservatives are still considered the most important party in the Southern province, they are definitely forced to form a coalition in the future.
The first signs of restructuring in the party, Huber's potential successor, Party Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, joins the small exploratory team beginning investigative negotiations about a possible Munich-based government with liberal FDP and with Free Voters representing right-wing values.
Fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose intervention against Stoiber was misused as a coup opportunity and later was handled by the Huber-Beckstein duo, becomes a member of the legislative assembly from the party list of Free Voters.
CSU leaders are making efforts to stabilize Beckstein in any way.
According to the former state minister and former CSU president, Herbert Stoiber, who was staying in the background for the past two years, will play an active role in the transition time.
Huber made some bitter comments on CDU on Monday, according to him CSU should have received much more support from its fellow party.
Other CSU politicians think the defeat is a warning to both CDU and Merkel.
After the Bundestag Election due in September 2009, Merkel cannot be chancellor unless CSU, which was a major part of the 2005 national success, is rehabilitated through mutual efforts.
According to the disappointed Merkel, the failure of CSU will not have any impact on the coalition government in Berlin.
Although it is relative, the wounded CSU is not going to be easier to handle and the social democrats are going to continue to crisis.
SPD has achieved its weakest result with 18.6 percent in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko-Opposition: 110-0
No opposition representative was elected to the Belarusian parliament on Sunday.
The reasons for this are the well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, while the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) explains it as vote counting frauds.
OSCE delegating 450 observers from 43 countries refuses to recognise the election.
Although the 100 member legislation of the country of 10 million has been missing opposition for more than a decade, the opposition within the United Democratic Forces (UDF) was seriously expecting that Lukashenko, who renewed his fourth term in 2006 after the controversial elections in 2006, would allow some opposition representatives in the parliament this time.
Based on this, UDF also disappeared from the formerly considered boycott.
The background of the expectations of the opposition was that the increasingly Russia-dependent Belarus - that raised a loan to reduce the more and more expensive Russian gas import and agreed to Beltransgas owning the gas pipelines crossing the country becoming Russian property - wanted to improve its relations with the EU, where visas are not granted for Lukashenko and for many top politicians due to the Belarusian political system, which is considered anti-democratic.
The fact that OSCE when evaluating the election campaign focused on positive changes instead of deficiencies - like banning one third of the opposition candidates from participating in the elections - indicates a former political calma.
However, OESC's Monday minute sheet raised objections to the campaign, during which opposition candidates were practically unable to appear in the media and especially opposition not being permitted to be present at the vote count.
According to the opposition, improvement is still perceptible in the political system: political prisoners have been discharged and Minsk is still inclined to confront Moscow in a minor way by still not recognising South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have secluded from Georgia, but Russia has already considered them independent for a month.
Belarus has taken two steps ahead and one back, but most important is that the EU has started to talk with Belarus and Belarus.
The opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, says that the "power has become afraid of allowing even one opposition member to enter the parliament of no weight".
Viewing the results, the opposition does not plan protesting actions, but rather aims to reach the voters with its message about the importance of economic reforms.
However, we have a lot of difficulty with printing, distribution is hindered by local authorities, but I can still see changes being favoured by more and more people, among the old.
Because of the debt burden and increase of trade deficit, the breakdown of social security 'like dead silence' is a question of time.
Observers described the elections as democratic, in contrast to the opposition politician.
Belarusian political maturity is nothing but evidence of maturity in Belarus.
Brunett: "From now breakfast before work "
It has never been reported in all the history of the Chigi Palace that there were revolving doors at the employee entrance and exit.
The new measure starts against crafty skivers, against those who clock in and then go to the bar for a coffee during working hours.
The novel anti-slackers measure was presented today by the Public Administration Minister, Renato Brunetta, and by the Director General of the Office of the Council President, Mauro Masi.
The revolving doors – says Brunetta – are tools for working better, with higher productivity, higher presence and more services.
Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is reformism, underlines Brunetta.
With the Chigi Palace, the installation of all the building of the Office of the Council President is complete.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic perspective".
The workers have not given any opposition, says the Secretary General: "It has been a common process with the workers and everyone collaborated".
To conclude, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
A word from Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at seven is blessed".
During a conference at the High School of Public Administration, the Secretary of State was present at the Conference of the High School of Public Administration.
Following the minister's announcement, he says that in three months the absences of public employees due to sick have reduced by 50%, which is 60 thousand more people working in a year.
It adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient.
They are Italians, whose wage dynamics have been double with respect to the private sector and far above the inflation rate.
Meantime, thousands of public employees have joined to challenge the provisions of the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by Codacons.
While the Minister for Civil Service today displays figures regarding reduced absenteeism at work due to sick workers – the consumers' association writes – the population of ‘the industrious skivers’ is continuously increasing.
In fact, in Italy there are thousands of honest and productive public administration employees who have united to declare war on the illegitimate provisions in the decree.
In particular, at the TAR the exclusion of additional economic benefits for infirmity incurred during work will be contested; the extension of the hours that a sick employee must make available for control medical visits, and other aspects of the new provisions which are being advocated by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Preventive action is crucial"
Every day, in Italy, 2500 accidents occur, 3 persons die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
In 2007, INAIL data confirm that work-related deaths have been around 1200.
Figures that evidence the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and almost doubles the deaths with homicide.
The importance of giving the attention of institutions, social forces and information media to this dramatic issue, Anmil is celebrating in all the Italian provinces the 58th National Day for Work-related Accidents, which is institutionalised on the second Sunday of October.
The very same tragic news shows how important prevention at work is, says the Republic President Giorgio Napolitano in his message to Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Invalids at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "deep appreciation of the constant associative efforts for prevention at work, care for injured workers, assistance to the families of the casualties, and public opinion".
However, an indignant ‘enough’ has been raised, sincerely shared in front of tragedies that, due to their size, cause outbreaks by the media and public opinion but everyday reality offers dramatic cases, which are even repetitive.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is a resource problem, and training and information is important.
The most important role is assumed by the many initiatives promoted in the schools in raising awareness of younger generation that face the work market.
It is a duty to keep alive the awareness of the phenomenon, not give up to its social alarm, and implement and improve the legal provisions.
The Chamber President Gianfranco Fini has underlined that “accidental deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, that threatens our conscience and requires all institutions to urgently end it”.
Although statistics regarding work injuries seem to signal a small positive trend, it does not take away the fact that the number of accidental deaths is quite significant, according to Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
However, we do not want that this ‘downturn trend' translates into reduced alertness, because it is when attention is reduced that the tragedy explodes.
However, we believe that at a general level little is done to counter the phenomenon of industrial injury and the fight can be carried on through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to have more control and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workforce, and this should start at school.
"More effort is needed – he added – in communication and sensitization of public opinion.
However, a greater sense of responsibility is required on behalf of employers in relation to a social emergency.
Mercandelli then called for "progressive deterioration of the level of care provided for work losses" and the "welfare drift which the system has taken in recent years".
The aim is to restore to the worker the insurance guarantee, so that the fate of those who are injured does not depend on spontaneous political actions or grants that are often set out by legislators.
Mp3 players under accusation, they risk hearing.
Listening to high volume music for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing loss.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a communication released in Brussels cites the advice given by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) of the EU, published today.
According to this scientific advice, 5- 10 % of those who weekly listen to music using portable musical players for more than an hour a day with the device at high volume risk permanent loss of hearing ability.
”I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music players and cellular phones may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way”, says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – carries on the EU spokesperson – a clear risk emerges and we have to respond swiftly.
What is most important, we need to sensitize consumers and make this information available to the public.
Additionally, in light of this scientific advice, we need to re-examine existing control systems to ensure they are completely effective and kept up to date with new technology.
Brussels had asked the independent scientific Committee to investigate the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable music players and the increase in young people exposed to the noise they produce.
Scientists confirm that there are reasons for concern and the European Commission will now look at measures to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise from portable music players and related equipment.
Currently, a European security provision already exists which limits the noise level of portable musical players to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage caused by excessive exposure to such noise sources are increasing.
It is possible to considerably reduce the damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing the level and duration of the noise exposure.
In the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee, if users of portable musical players listen to high volume (>89 dB) for only 5 hours per week, they are already over the permissible maximum noise limits for workplaces.
People who listen to music under such conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period.
This is the case for 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives a go ahead to the Future of the Capital Commission
Today it starts, March it ends, June the conclusions are drawn.
This is the schedule set by the Campoglio for the "Future of the Capital Commission", which has taken up residence at its new premises behind Caracalla Hot Springs.
In six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will set out the guidelines for Rome.
After the project has been completed in March, the Municipal Board and Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, so that in June the strategic plan for Rome can be presented with the official stamp of the Campidoglio and the mayor Gianni Alemanno.
The Commission is absolutely independent and all political opinions, social and cultural opinion are represented.
There is no superposition of roles but only the will to have a place where a big project for Rome can be drawn up.
In March it will do its job and it will dissolve, because this experiment has a specific deadline.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present the strategic plan using work done by the Future of Rome Capital Commission.
The Commission is not binding, since its opinions will not be binding.
If quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure there will be in Rome, it will be fundamental.
Politics are often overwhelmed by everyday administration and by emergencies that manifest themselves occasionally.
The contrary, we want to look further and further ahead, with a deeper perspective, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future.
The mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this commission is not a useless agency nor a huge bureaucratic organisation, it will not cost the city a cent and it will serve to get reasoning and involvement from the best minds that the Capital has to offer".
According to Alemanno, “it is essential to have a strategic reference plan, not closed or inflexible, to allow our city to do an authentic quality leap in quality, which it really needs, thinking with a united spirit of its future.
The future that, says the Mayor of Rome, will not limit itself to the current municipal borders but will look further afield, not only with regard to future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also with regard to the role that Rome can and must play in Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama? The first anti-American President. Here is why?
The famous American politician who would like to pass off as independent, wrote: Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had dealing (as he still does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Obama’s attack increases as the election date approaches.
The woman from Miami has written on the web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is being cheeky: he thinks he can win the highest position in a country with two governors and five senators that were black.
The attacks are nothing but racial attacks, and do not answer the question of a good president.
Even in this case there are those who speak from the heart and not from the head.
The Mississippi newspaper, deep in the South of the United States, wrote an editorial: Once inside the voting cabin we know well enough to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
The side of the United States mentality that has been kept under wraps for the last decade emerges.
"Say what you like, then we'll take care of where to put the cross, Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will go away from America.
The latest facts that have never been said before now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning trump for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people have been asked what have been the errors committed by Bush during his mandate? 89 per cent have answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with its tail between its legs.
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have died and Americans have not been forced to pack up and leave.
However, for most people Iraq has been the weak point of Bush.
Whoever takes up the place of George W. will have a huge task to do.
However, in USA, the economic depression is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the print paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by PEW Research Centre what they think about the state of their profession and mental control in the future.
Today journalists are mostly very sceptics about their future.
The information clerks have not openly declared to be less concerned with credibility.
They do not feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
The cuts in the newsroom, the office where editors work to assemble the newspaper, are a major problem.
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want that traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public is substantially diminished.
The clear but complex optimism now dominates American journalists.
Six out of ten journalists of the print press and senior executives are convinced that journalism at a national level is going down the wrong road.
Within the local field the Executive Group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are opening a passage for themselves to the Internet, often seen as the "assassin" of the paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists have felt has reached up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have acknowledged that they are embracing technology in hopes that it will do some good for their journalism.
The biggest rift in American journalism nowadays is between those who manage the newsrooms – that is the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national managers are confident that their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage drops to 23%.
Some of this has to do with job security.
On a national level, 43% of the manager believe they will lose their jobs within 3 years.
For journalists the figure is 30%.
As for job security at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America it varies on a daily basis.
Only 13% of journalists have a work contract.
In an enormous nation with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journals, magazines, radio, TV, and internet employers offer what they want and thus it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
Directors usually receive huge salaries, while an editor may earn up to 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to the pension and paid insurance.
As for holiday, things get complicated: so many days the first year, so many days after the third to get to a total of 15 days after a certain number of years.
The American journalists, by their own admission, often "ill" during the year.
It is all about climate.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS AT GROTTAFERRATA
The second penal section of the Rome tribunal has decided to reject the petition made by the estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who requested to move from his home town, Grottaferrata, to a home in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy within the scope of the counter-proposal on the Unipol-Bnl takeover.
While on trial, last week, he received the release from house arrest transformed into an obligation to stay in Grottaferrata.
The lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked the agent to travel from the country town within the province to an abode in the capital.
The tribunal believes that such trips (against which the PM has advised) would allow him to influence his company and to have access to the evidence that is used to charge him.
Elite in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a couple days back with the vote in the House of Representatives against the 700 billion American dollar rescue plan approved by the White House: a large proportion of Americans were more interested in fighting Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The confirmation was given yesterday by the New York Times when it reported that the current crisis is causing a split within the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, in favour of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, conservative, in favour of Washington and the financial world, particularly strong in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, to be exact, which has become overbearingly alive with the vote mentioned initially.
The latter is but one example of the changes, of the big changes that the current economic earthquake may herald or allow to be seen, not only in the United States but also in all the West and maybe not only here.
Both in USA and Europe the crisis seems to act as a catalyst for a series of phenomenals that have been incubated for some time and which in the new climate have finally emerged.
The first of these phenomena is the massive re-launch of the twin category state-sovereignty in relation to a sort of nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is a crisis for the financial-banking institutions that have indeed strong links with foreign countries, but which mainly deal with the budgets of individuals or families living in a single nation, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for whoever is in government: and that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families that also form the electorate.
In other words the crisis seems to be global but politically it is almost exclusively national problem.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of play or to have little to say: the clear evidence of this is the European Union, divided as usual between the different interests and the different state strategies, cannot agree on a common political path.
The government of each State must wait for intervention, bailout and re-launching plans, new rules, and especially financial aid, since that when the worst happens it is the States that have the resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to fix things.
They also have the necessary means and legitimate reasons to use them: two resources of incalculable value, which no market or international organisation could ever dispose of in any way.
This new focus on the state-national element is almost perfectly compatible with the ever increasing importance that recent economic developments give to a coefficient that is closely linked to that element: territoriality.
While we were already convinced that we had entered the reign of the web, of a technologically increasingly sophisticated, immaterial technology, we suddenly realized that our future would be focused on things that are very little material, such as water, harvests, oil.
Accidentally, all are items that can be transported from one place to another but are always tied to a well defined space, to a territory.
The person who becomes the sovereign , probably has more cards in his deck than he who happens to live in a place without crops, oil or water.
The second novelty is a very interesting novelty that however predicts split.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, always implies Politics, and consequently Leadership.
In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the other hand the knowledge of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the need for somebody who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand a wave of discredit for existing leadership, an economic sort, revealed to be so inadequate and full of grey areas.
And together something ever deeper and in some way disturbing: discredit, intolerance, inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire leadership class of an ever-increasing number of Western countries.
The latter seems to spread further into a large section of the population the confidence that their actions are the same ideas as the social elite up to now in favor, their way of feeling and being, their culture in all accepted meanings of the word, to have had their day, and to always be more alien to the majority.
The call for leadership feeds underhandedly a broad but massive movement of delegitimization of the managerial class and of the traditional political structure, manifesting itself in sudden electoral revolts or abrupt twists in the collective moods in recent and recent times, from the rise of the conservative rise in Austria – Bavaria to the collapse of the labor consensus in Great Britain, to the revolt of the American Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
The traditional elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, some would say their formats, are finding it always difficult to comprehend, and thus to represent what is taking place in the deepest layers of western societies and which the economic crisis is strengthening, increasing, potentially agitating.
In face of all this, talking about a "rebellion of the masses" as being the order of the day may be a bit exaggerated.
If one's eyes are wide open, it is not sure.
Superglue to be able to walk on walls
The ability to defeat gravity by using a super glue and in future be able to walk up walls like Spiderman.
It is the aim of many American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 cm squared the scientists have succeeded in gluing a 100 kilogram body on a vertical wall.
Studying – The American magazine Science has published some research findings from some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material developed by the team of scientists is an improvement on existing materials that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
The principle of the glue is like a series of tubes arranged like spaghetti, explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspiring by the paws of geckoes, covered with microscopic bristles that ensure a perfect adhesion to the animal.
The tests on various materials such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper have proved that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the paws of this reptile and also "easier to get off from walls".
- "This material can be used as temporary glue" says Liming Dai.
Maybe for walking on walls like Spiderman? Maybe, but the researchers are thinking of a less glamorous use, such as connections between electrical devices, because the carbon nanotubes are heat and electrical current.
Other applications may be in the aerospace industry.
For now no superheroes.
Other research – Even Berkeley University, in California, is dedicated to the research of a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society the California scientists have presented an adhesive composed of microfibers like hair that self-cleans from the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: Never with fruit juices.
Be careful of grapefruit juice, orange juice, and apple juice.
The drinks, especially consumed in summer because they are thirst quenching and rich in vitamins, may alter their absorption, amplifying or diminishing their effectiveness, with consequences that may also be serious for health.
Confirming the risks posed by the consumption of fruit juices whether pre-packaged or fresh, David Bailey, professor at Western Ontario University in London, who from the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia releases a new warning: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange juice, or apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain lifesaving drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and putting patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice has been accused of causing a rise in the effects of some antirhythmic, antibiotic, tranquilising, and neurological medicines.
MEDICATIONS AT RISK – The same Italian Drug Agency had given similar advice in an information bill two years ago, alerting doctors and patients to not underestimate the dangers posed by this mix and to take care about what is taken when drugs are taken such as Diazepam or Methadone.
However, even orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
The list of active principles inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices is very long.
Michele Carruba, Director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan, says: "Usually such discoveries are immediately brought to the attention of the international and national drug agencies that then change the information slips of medicines.
Always read the explanation notes of the medicines taken and if there is something that is not clear, do not hesitate to ask the doctor or chemist for clarification.
The Nobel Prize for Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel for Economy is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on market models and localisation of economic activities.
55 year old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian teacher at Princeton University and is a well-known leader of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the choices made in economy and international policy by the Bush administration.
Then, a few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron was going bankrupt, Krugman had predicted that the second incident would have been more determining than the first in terms of its consequences on the United States history.
The prediction that caused a fair number of disputes and that for years had been thrown in the face of the economist, but now has been revealed to have been exact.
”I am surprised and also annoyed by the speed with which recollections of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from public attention,” Krugman told the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an “economist of great value”, but also an aggressive speaker, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration”.
Open Office, here is the 3rd edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
Today sees the release of Openoffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to gain more users, from domestic to home users, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
The new Open Office is revealed to the general public with several novelties, including native compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2.
Additional attention was also placed on interoperability with Office 2007 suite, Open Office is capable of opening documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
These are interesting functions specific to some modules, such as the one that reduces the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for emailing them, or the possibility of importing a PDF file into the graphics module, maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on the same track, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents, which mix the standard graphics of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or word processor.
Collaboration is one of the features in the applications that has been considerably improved: in the spreadsheet application several users can operate simultaneously, avoiding conflicts on the modifications, and in the word processor, each user is assigned a commenting colour to improve recognition during revision.
Some companies are also working on moving some of OpenOffice’s functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the next few weeks they should release the definitive product.
The Italian version is available for download at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version which has been available on mirror sites since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for Linux operating systems.
On request the installation CD can be sent to your home or office.
If the gimmick of free could drive the diffusion into homes, it is in the business setting that Open Office is trying to play the big role since it has already built several projects in public administration and schools.
There are even institutions that offer training services, consultancy and assistance, ideally small to medium enterprises, which could create more business opportunities.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for onscreen typing equivalent to Word; Calc, the spreadsheet application aiming at substituting Excel; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is the database application; Draw, is the graphic module.
The aim for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that we have almost 3 million 600 thousand downloads, with the release of the new version it is probably that the figure will even exceed it.
Even Kohl tested positive, it is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positive testing in the last Tour of France is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl of Gerolsteiner team, third in classification and winner of the best grimpeur shirt.
Reporting the news is the daily newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26 year old Kohl is the fourth cyclist to test for Cera, the third generation EPO, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner team.
The analysis of the blood samples from Kohl is part of the recent investigations performed in the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counteranalysis confirms the tests as positive to Cera, Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and face the two-year canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl testing positive to the third generation Epo is the French Anti-Doping Agency's head, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified Austrian authorities of the positive test results.
The Austrian was a finalist behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka-dotted shirt of the best grime.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW York is wondering, is Italy RACIST?
Italy, from a country of emigrants, recently changed into a privileged destination for immigrants, reluctantly received.
The question is asked in a long article in the New York Times, which has dedicated a long article to the issue of racism in Italy, starting from the case of Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
The case shows that the northern regions are simultaneously the regions where integration and most work is being achieved but also where the highest anti-immigrant sentiments in the country and the highest support for the Northern League.
As a confirmation of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants the NYT has also cited intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Only.
Even the new legislation from the League that tightens immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is advanced as a paradigm of the change in Italy.
The trend has been highlighted by the Pope as well by the Republic's President "Giorgio Napolitano who meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal has asked that the State and the Church work together to fight racism.
Students are being hit by high rents up to 900 Euro for a room.
The rent market for university students is not known for crises.
According to the latest investigation by SUNIA, the tenants' syndicate, renting a single room can cost up to 900 Euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
The phenomenon has now become very serious, especially in cities where students are excluded from the right to study due to the high cost of living that their families would have to sustain.
In most cases the rent-offers contain a series of violations: freestyle contracts, unregistered, without rent limits, connected subleases.
According to SUNIA special intervention is needed to cool down the prices.
Looking at the details of the investigation, one can see that in Milan, for a bed-space in the Brianza zone, 450 Euro are required; for a single room, the price ranges from 450 (Black Band zone), to an average price of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera), and up to a maximum of 900 (Victoria zone).
In Florence a bed-space costs on average 350/400 Euro, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate themselves in close proximity to the university, 250/280 Euro are required for a bed-space in a double room, and from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in the central area of the university (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) approximately 600 Euro is the asking price for a single room, 450 Euro for a bed-space in a double room.
Cheaper (550 Euro for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Savings are only possible by moving to the suburbs: 300 Euro for a bed-space and 450 for a single in areas such as Prenestrina, Centocelle and similar places.
In Naples 300/450 Euro are required for a bed-space, for a single room one spends 400 to 600 Euro, with the highest prices found in Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed-space 250/350 Euro are required, at least 350 for a single.
Smaller cities have lower prices in absolute terms, but they have a higher impact on the local economy.
In cities where renting to non-EU students is more common, such as Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30 % of the rent price asked from foreign students compared with that asked from Italian students.
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, cities cancel historical theatres
Historical cinematographic theatres close in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinema theatres is a blind city, like a face without eyes".
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in large Italian urban centres but also in provincial towns.
The sidelining process of cinemas, with the birth in the outskirts of large multi-hall theatres and the consequent death by consumption of the single-hall theatres in the central areas of the city, is one of those events that seems unavoidable and incontrovertible and also has all the features of a real cultural crime.
Occasionally, it is historical places full of memories that disappear, a friend who has shared the way and many memories.
The numbers provided by Anec, the main cinema-operators association, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed shop, and the ones to pay the price were above all the main theatres in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna, and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Following Emilia-Romagna, Italy leads with 82 single-hall cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The three Italian regions with the most recent number of new multiplex cinemas registered are the three Italian regions with the most recent number of new multiplex cinemas registered: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
”Italian theatre industry has developed in an irrational way, so new structures are necessary but it is also important that existing ones are kept, because once a theatre closes, not all its patrons may shift to the multiplexes.
Not mention the misuse of funds for operators: the previous debts by the state are about 10 million Euro.
It is disgraceful, from an ethical and moral perspective, that the government does not respect existing laws.
To sustain the sector between 16 and 18 million Euro a year are needed».
The first Italian city to take cover is Bologna, the first Italian city that, being concerned by the closures, has signed a protocol with the municipal administration and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-hall cinemas both in the historic centre and on the outskirts.
The proposed provisions include tax relief for operators and mobility benefits for the public: spectators can enter the traffic-limited zone and have special tariffs for road parking and in some car parks.
It is an initiative I like, says Giuseppe Tornatore.
The fact is that to contrast the excessive power of the multiplex, traditional theatres also need to improve sound and image quality, because the public is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinemas is always important to me, and the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that inspired me to create "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have already thought for for 10 years.
When I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinal in National Street both closed by now, I turn away to not see the posters being blackened by the dust.
Politics and ‘ndrangheta links arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was disposed to conform with the municipal interests of the Piromalli gang".
The accusations that the Calabrese Anti-Mafia Office authorities direct against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli are very serious.
Also arrested is Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration offices, and his nephew - a lawyer, named after the boss, already condemned for mafia-style criminal association, with a debt of 10 million euros.
In contempt of all judicial and moral rules, and common sense, the two local administrations have expressed their willingness to consult with Piromalli.
The gang allowed for the gang to officially penetrate the municipality, easing the already vast possibilities of control and directing public administration.
The Calabrian local council president Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local institutions and organised crime are numerous" in his region: "There are areas where mafia presence is stronger and more intense than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, there are many local politicians who resist the pressure from the 'ndrangheta, heroes who remain clean.
This morning’s arrests follow those in July with which the police announced to have killed the Piromalli gang.
The municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for presumed conditioning between organised crime and local administration, local politicians were relieved from their duties of administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the mayor of UDC at the time of the dissolution, was elected head of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
The council was a scandal when the Prefecture orderd the dissolution of the municipal council.
The judges have explained that the Piromalli gang had even reached at the request for the variation of the A3 project.
The public prosecution says that "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a large group notoriously close to the Piromalli, aligning the public administration with the interests of the gang".
When energy is born from the waves the big plays.
It is an enormous body, that covers 70% of the planet's surface and now the big, international energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources being eyed, and subjected to development by corporates such as Chevron.
The possibility of using water movement energy has been under investigation for hundred years and in the 70s, coinciding with the first oil crisis, research was intensified.
The idea of exploiting marine energy was abandoned around 1980, but now the appeals by the environmentalists and the new increase in oil prices have given a new boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated that in 2007 15 percent of the world's electrical needs could be provided by the use of the seas' uncontrolled motion.
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power stations.
Then there would be the winds and the tides.
Colossi on attack.
The first company to play on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to construct a plant in north Portugal.
The understanding was announced and it looked like a revolutionary step.
Two years on there are more companies betting on marine energy and among these, there are companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy.
"Chevron is researching oceanic energy technology – a spokesman for a company associated with the US oil giant has declared to the economy daily Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of working with us".
The cooperation in question is the obtaining of a permit from the US Energy Commission, necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a significant sign, especially if one considers that right in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has set up a new plan for new drilling.
Following Chevron there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the marine energy path and the amounts invested so far, although they are not known in detail, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to be made ready.
While experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, marine energy does not leave all doubts about its environmental impact.
The plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not appear to have major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, but technologies with higher environmental impact must be implemented.
The choices are diverse: Ocean Power uses a system of buoys connected between themselves.
The thrust of the waves, which makes the buoys move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
The pressure turns a turbine into a turbine, which in turn fuels a generator.
The electricity is sent to shore through underwater cables.
The plants are now waiting for federal approval and part of the energy is used by military installations.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for a commercial centre and parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The water movement when the sea is moving makes the turbines rotate, creating a rotary motion that generates a generator.
Verdant has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to benefit from the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Particular interest, declare the people at the Electrical Energy Research Institute, is now being given by the potential of tides.
The tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and so is more reliable as a source of energy.
The same is the case for tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, together with others that overlook the coast, have already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and are expected to invest up to 35 million for 2009.
