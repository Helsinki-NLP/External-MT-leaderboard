In my view, the literature program was shaped by the ladies of the Balzac era based on their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilyevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote the ballet, of course, from the perspective of the same ladies of the Balzac era.
And the psychology and torture of Tolstoy and Turgenev's heroines is not so interesting to teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Andrei, you've been told that in schools, there are retired women, they won't be working in the command line.
The computer science teacher can't help either, he wasn't taught that, the school is playing Windows games.
So there's no support.
I remember with horror these feasts and guests at my parents' house.
Guests are at the door, and the plates are still cooking, and Mommy is clutching to wash the floor.
Oh, my God, I'm so tired of sitting at the table.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
You're gonna be picking up groceries a week before the holidays, two days of shoveling, a day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They're fine, and they'll have a cake with them.
I've been a little bit off about holidays ever since, guests.
I'm even keeping a table for my family.
And I make them some delicious snacks, and I bake them very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccine is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough to fully protect.
This is what Ulrich Weigeldt, head of the Association of General Practitioners, believes.
This is reported on Saturday, December 11, by Die Welt.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be needed in the summer, at the latest in the fall", the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that a fourth coronavirus vaccination could be carried out "in combination with flu vaccination".
This will help you get the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help fight the spread of the new Omicron strain of coronavirus.
And the new version is particularly dangerous.
So the chances of recovering from the Omicron are three times higher than those of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide adequate protection against infection with the new variant of the Omicron coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that two doses of the vaccine were significantly less effective: "neutralizing potential decreased by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide adequate protection against omicron-stamp infection", BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
That's why we need a third dose.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates shortening the gap between the second and third vaccines.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very convincing", the expert stressed.
The Pontoon21 Wobbler, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
Bet-A-Vib is a special branch of the Bet-A family of companies from Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created for use in under-ice fishing, not just for catching squid.
These vibes have a larger, more specific weight than their closest analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting primates.
Another recognizable feature is the upper floating plate made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional vibration shades when vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a winter vibe, Bet-A-Vib is a fairly aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, which means that the movements of the head up and down are almost without pause.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, crustaceans and other obstacles that can trap.
In addition, a small deviation is important when catching a large oak and a small pike in winter, especially in the middle of winter when it is necessary to give the bait sparingly and aggressively.
Once the extreme point of the trajectory is reached, Bet-A-Vib immediately spins and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used to catch pond trout in winter.
To appeal to its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS  NanoSound) or without it (SL  Silent).
Bet-A-Vib is also said to be able to irritate a passive sting that doesn't even respond to a live animal.
Bet-A-Vib's catch is a measure of distance and accuracy.
This waffle is understandable and not capricious, it fits well with wool and knitted strings of even large diameters.
For fishing, the catch of a stork, a sudak, a herring or an oak is also equally relevant, sometimes with a "swing" along the bottom.
If you're fishing in loaded areas, you can change the front triple to the double, which reduces the likelihood of traps.
Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable and, as a result, one of the most catchy of its class.
It can be used with the same success on relatively small sites as well as on quite deep sites.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young jobless people are sitting on the necks of old parents.

In Libya, 7 thousand Russian mercenaries were reported
There are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company Wagner in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Republic's Supreme State Council, Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are currently more than 7 thousand mercenaries in Libya.
They have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the air bases of Gardiabia (used also as a civilian airport in Sirte) ", Anadolu quotes him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Keeping the presence
According to the magazine's interviewer, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufr, the agency's publication notes.
Russian authorities have officially denied that the Wagner CCP is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else can the mercenaries be?
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to operate in nine African countries - Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technology and military services to these countries", the article says.
According to the media, the "vagneyros" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies or the law enforcement registry, and its fighters are not listed in the formal personnel lists.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
The post-presidents of 27 EU countries have approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Libyan Supreme Council of State is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for a single day of voting for the elections of parliamentary deputies and heads of state to be postponed from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks until the election and the chances of it being held on time are decreasing rapidly", the report said.
Against this background, the Libyan Election Commission postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy in the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in their foreign policy, 29% believe that failure is prevalent.
"Examples of successes are: "We defended Syria, we restored peace there", "the North Stream 2 decision", "the whole world was scared that it was a tough weapon", "We pushed Crimea back".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - says a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
Dubai government has completely abandoned paperwork - all government services have also become digital
The Dubai government has announced a complete abandonment of paperwork and a shift to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively electronically.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitizing all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government", the emirate's crown prince, Dubai Executive Council Chairman, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, said on Saturday.
Now, internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government institutions will be done only digitally through special information platforms.
The innovation has touched all sectors: healthcare, housing, police, municipal bodies, courts, etc. Many commercial organizations have joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalisation of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
In that time, the authorities estimated, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in cash equivalents.
Earlier, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, the dates of birth and the age of the child are a bit of a joke, class and kindergarten class, too.
I can't believe there's such a stretch.
And if they do, they obviously don't care about anything, including their family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandpa and grandma lived on Vladimirskaya 3, was 1 floor without bars.
They knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to do the ceremony, broke the window and walked in, but my grandfather had a baseball bat that they got.
These people knew there was someone in the house...
Turkey's car production and export fell below 2020 levels
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance for the past 11 months was worse than last year's, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkey from factories, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75,9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year.
And if the automotive sector in Turkey showed a positive dynamic compared to last year, at the end of the first 10 months of 2021, the output of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this drop was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November was 29% cheaper than the dollar.
This has led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMBs received a delay on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation in granting concessions to small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of the Kazakh media.
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in execution of the President's order of April 1, 2021, the Agency Chairman's order of April 9, 2021, No. 127 "About approval of the Order of granting deferred payments on loans of small and medium business entities", Alihan Smailov wrote in his reply to the deputy request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and microfinance organizations of deferred payments on loans granted to SME entities, including IPs, until April 1, 2021, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The delay period was 30 to 90 days, depending on the choice of the SME.
The borrower's application could have indicated another deadline for deferring payments.
During the period of delay, the claim-seeking work against the borrower was suspended, the notification of the need to pay the overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor", - said the deputy prime minister.
For 2021, the second-level banks received applications to defer payments on loans from 603 SMB borrowers-subjects, of which 553 SMB subjects received deferrals of 9.7 billion tenge.
In the MFA, 131 SME subjects submitted applications for deferral, of which 95 subjects received a deferral for 105,8 million tenge", - concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryashev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the "okmiron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems could tolerate it more easily than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryassev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "okmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason for this is the virus's origin.
Scientists believe that the "oakmiron" was born in the body of an HIV-infected person or an immunocompromised person.
So, when he mutated, he didn't encounter any resistance from the immune system.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the immune system, he got very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, may be more than it should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - says pulmonologist Sergey Puryassev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems could tolerate oxymoron more easily than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, and old people in their 60s, who are like chickens, carry it.
The young man's immune response is furious, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with a finger, he hits like a gun on sparrows, - concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded us that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is often bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, the second often only covers up the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of body intoxication - fever, weakness, malaise.
Then there are the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain, may also be a sign of an developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the 12 to 18-year-old generation could start getting vaccinated by the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the MFI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from the Covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the most contact.
It is the most socially active class, as are the children of kindergartens, - said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the MFTI.
I'd like to thank the author for this article.
I'm happy to refresh my memory...
Teath-in.
In the late seventies and early eighties, no dance floor was without the melodies of this group.
And at home, we gathered with friends and danced to their music.
Immunologists have proposed a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID
The authors of the paper examined the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue, the macrophages, also became infected, and they showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died from the virus and found particles of coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in the fat tissue, using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid an immune response.
It's likely that SARS-CoV-2 can do that, too.
Biologist told about the causes of dementia
Biological science candidate Semen Golosheikin has named the causes of dementia and told about the ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself in the gradual loss of cognitive functions - with time, a person has difficulty navigating even in familiar situations.
Golocheikin noted that most often, dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role", he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders, and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor", the biologist added.
To prevent disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic.
He was a professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics at the FGAAU.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the department of cognitive impairments of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally taken from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return some 30,000 artifacts smuggled out of the country illegally.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Shaaban Abdel Gaoud.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C"., he said.
Abdul Gaoud said all the smuggled artifacts were registered in the archives.
Now the department is working on bringing them back to Egypt.
In particular, the experts "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social media.
The chief inspector said that when the cultural treasures are returned, they are restored and then put on display in museums.
He said one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, which was sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held auctions on July 4 to sell the 3 thousand-year-old bust for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused a great deal of discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
Tutankhamun's head, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate ancient monuments that were illegally removed from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the antiquities smuggled are the result of archaeological excavations of "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, because Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazans) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse is demanding that its employees give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, the Financial Times reports.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications partner.
Under current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices provided to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote mode, the bank wants to extend the rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline for employees to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse has not commented on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Yessenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet and his "ego" to live on earth.
He's out of any literary association, he's been drawn to imagery, he's himself, but he's known, he's in demand, sometimes he's been badly criticized, even maligned, but the public is willing to carry him around.
Over the course of a year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motives" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegin" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Rus Sovietskaya".
And the main success - at the end of June 25th of the year, the State Department signed a contract with Yesenin to publish his writings in 3 volumes.
No modern Sergey Aleksandrovich poet has ever been so honored, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - the contract fee was 1000 rubles a month for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).
The funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter, Sophie Tolstoy, and had to provide for her family, support her sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as her mother.
Life seems to be getting better, there's something to be happy about, but for him everything is mostly painted in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin) was materializing:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind blowing
On a field of no man,
I'm growing up in September.
Alcohol is killing the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin was very much abandoned, looked bad, clearly ill.
More and more, the bruises, the nervous breakdown.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made by someone to Sergei Alexandrovich, reliable documents are missing.
Let's say that it dates back to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American woman Aysedora Duncan, was improving health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannonushkin (yesenin would be back in Moscow two years later).
But the evidence of the poet's songs, the scandals on this ground, the police's taken away is enough - scattered throughout dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 1920s, the poet's horror novel with the green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yessenin settled for a short time with his friend, the imaginist Ivan Starsev.
Amazingly, with his very good income, Yesenin never had a home in Moscow or Peter, he got it in rented apartments, hotels or acquaintances.
Elders remembers:
"He came only to sleep at night, and in most cases in a state of insanity, intoxicated.
One day, on his way back at 4:00 a.m., Esenin fell down a flight of stairs...
He fell, scratched his face and scratched.
"After he regained consciousness, he coughed up his entire body, splashing blood on it".
Yes, after his trip to Europe and the United States (the United States was a dry law at the time, but Duncan brought a decent supply of alcohol with him)
"I saw nothing there except the cabbages and the streets...
I'm almost done and I can't remember people...
Well, I was drinking, of course.
I drank because I was thirsty".

All his energy is focused on choosing what he wants to do for a living.
He's a lot more responsible than I was in his age or my husband, who had trouble with the law periodically before the wedding.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love".
Why did a girl cry on her exam when she hadn't failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that this wasn't a school?
She'll have a tail.
What's the matter?
He'll give up.
Millions of students know that.

Poland's Foreign Ministry says Belarus uses migrants as "weapons" against the EU
Poland's Foreign Ministry says Belarus uses migrants as "weapons"
Poland's deputy foreign minister, Pavel Jablonski, said Belarus' president Alexander Lukashenko had used refugees as "weapons" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operations" next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made the relevant statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonski, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "suspended Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official also believes that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
As kp.ru website wrote, earlier the European Union had introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe has declared its readiness to extend further restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk has imposed a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that have previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not in the Shadow of the Hat": When a velvet jacket makes a man laugh
The 2021 world events were dominated by velvet jackets.
I think the first person to announce his new fashion line was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "It's Not Time to Die", he appeared in a velvety raspberry jacket and a traditional "bonda" butterfly.
Prince William followed suit twice, first wearing a green velvet jacket that did not match the royal dress code at the Earthshot Prize eco-prize award ceremony, and then picked a more classic version for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple weeks ago, Lionel Messi was on the trend.
The soccer player came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for men's velvet jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, which came to "Gazet.Ru", they began to buy 1,4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a slate and a silhouette, the main colors are dark-purple, boulder, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. Men prefer to buy only jacks - they choose a set of velvet suits less often.
You can't just buy them at online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, barbed-wire jackets are available in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable model is considered Gucci, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared for one of the premieres of the film "Dom Gucci".
When you choose expensive jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology for interwoven threads, dense tissue is produced with a wrinkly exterior and a smooth inner side.
More budgetary options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin of Lamoda warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
"The bar is a nightlight, so it's perfect if you're at a party or a party", explains Vakhoshkin. "It's also suitable for those occasions when the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is on the invitation.
Another important criterion that allows you to choose a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a flea jacket must first and foremost have a proper, advanced, and affluent time", say the writers of the Telegram channel "Beautiful Brammell".
They're just invited to a secular event where they always have a dress code.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a barhat jacket with the same outfits: classic pants with arrows, one-ton shirts, silk ties, lofers with bristles, brushes.
Too simple and everyday things will seem inappropriate.
The fashion experts at Braammel's Beauty and the Beast are convinced that it would be inappropriate for a regular employee to appear in a corporate jacket, but if it is "a manager from among those who run this event, then - yes, he has such a thing about it".
If a low-ranking employee wants to move up in a complex company hierarchy or to beat financial bonuses, it's best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely rate this as the phrase "not by the Shadow of the Hat", - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
It's an unnatural tempo, it's so drawn out.
And it's not associated with a young girl's cute face at all.
I don't understand the admiration of the people around me.

It's all about money. Alternative energy is well-loved, so it pays off.
Billions of dollars in investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not on the table - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
Fuel is in high demand.
The coin is dropping.

Just mediocrity within the average passenger.
Perhaps if these characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, they're not going to fit in.

Immunologist says revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the Omikron coronavirus strain
Revaccination in four to five months could protect against a new strain of the Omikron coronavirus infection.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Krychkov, who called the vaccination after six months, given the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period"
"For the previous strains, this was normal, but now it is best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four", the expert said, urging them to revaccinate in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Krukkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has been given two vaccinations and a booster, or has become ill and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and has become ill, then he has received 'hybrid immunity,' that is, there are many and enough neutralising antibodies", the expert said.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The "Big Seven" countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) have published a statement following the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and cost" Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine", the statement said.
The ministers further urged Russia to "weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and respect its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities", as US President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine", the Foreign Ministers of the "Big Seven" also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited under international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return", they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our overall and comprehensive response", the statement said.
Earlier this afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Trass said Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
She said the meeting showed "the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of global GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia".
Pfizer vaccine is 32 times less effective than the omicron-stamp
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the coronavirus omicron-stamp is 32 times lower than other forms of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant", said Professor Malik Peirce.
At the same time, the scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron-stamp.
The authors concluded that the omicron-stamp could cause a new wave of viral circulation and increased mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the defense ministry of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian defense ministry, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as immortal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons in the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France are involved.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorisation of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany explained its refusal to provide arms to the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbas, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said Kiev was expecting help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, they expect Germany to be "a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense", the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the party of the "greens" of the Federal Republic of Germany Robert Habeck visited the republic, where he spoke for the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 warned Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
Foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the parties said in a final statement.
The meeting also condemned the increase of Russian troops near the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs", the statement said.
The G7 ministers and the EU's top representative noted that they "are united in their condemnation of Russia's armed escalation and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine".
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Trass warned at a press conference in Liverpool of "big consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression against Ukraine", she said (TASS quoted).
Earlier at the Liverpool summit, G7 foreign ministers agreed that the sides must return to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis due to the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
It was a "Norman format" negotiation.
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported the dialogue on Ukraine in the "Norman format".
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that, by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "have resigned themselves to their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

Ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen from online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by experts on information security in a conversation with RBC.
To reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data gets into the hands of attackers, it is recommended to keep the principal funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Some savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend that you set up a separate online shopping card.
If the money was stolen from a store that doesn't use 3D Secure, you can start a refund process.
"Within the framework of the rules established by the payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without using 3D Secure, the responsibility is imposed on the participant in the chain of payments who does not use this service", - said a representative of the Promsvyazbank.
Ecommpay's international payment provider Arthur Zaremba said the buyer has the right to file a claim against the bank no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the funds to the customer if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, the director of the League of Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 applications were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that a single window for online fraud complaints could be an effective solution in the current circumstances.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Germany's newly elected chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "North stream-2".
Although Scholz has stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries have expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose the "North Stream 2" project, which is expected to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
Morawiecki believes Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has said it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the disagreements.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not made a public commitment to stop the work of Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an agreement with Germany to halt the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and the G7 confirmed this position on Sunday.
Dmitry, look closely.
The view from the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
We've removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so you can see the second window partially.
And in general, those who are not familiar with the initial planning are skeptical.
I know these apartments very well and I can see how they've been redesigned.
Let's make sure they're okay.
It's always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, the toilet, the window frames, the faucets.
You wash them once a year at Passover, whatever, you have to wash them straight.
Just don't let it get you in the way.
The Ministry of Numbers wants to give writers residencies
The state will transfer to the Future Russian Literature Support Fund the federal property left to the USSR Writers' Union and the USSR Literature Fund.
Writer residences will be established on its basis, the Ministry of Finance reported to the "Parliamentary Gazette", which will be the founding member of the foundation.

Doctors warned of the danger of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartsieva and Sergey Tokarev warned of the danger of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after contracting COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
Physician-therapist, immunologist Irina Yartseva said that preventing the formation of blood clots after COVID-19 can trigger a stroke.
Yartsova explained that blood thinners are not for everyone, except if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, he had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinning drugs that prevent the formation of blood clots) according to the indications.
She said that there is a gloomy spell - everyone drinks anticoagulants for a long time and gets complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (blood outbreaks in the brain).
The chief profacologist of the UrFO, scientific director of the Society of Experts in Preventive Medicine, doctor of medical sciences Sergei Tokarev, told URA.RU that anticoagulants are often used by Russians before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe in questionable advice on the Internet and start practicing self-medication.
There are people who decide to start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And when they do a preliminary examination before the vaccine, they'll notice blood clots.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without knowing the cause of any symptoms.

The man who found the money in the church wall will be paid $ 20,000 by the plumber .
The plumber who found the money in the wall of a church in the U.S. state of Texas will be paid.
This is reported in a press release from the nonprofit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at the large Lakewood Evangelical Church, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches that godly Christians will have wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley repaired one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bags of cash and checks under heat insulation.
He gave the find to the church and he said he didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done", he said, quoting KPRC-TV.
Looks like the find is connected to a robbery that happened at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks that were stored in the church safe went missing.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no damage.
Nevertheless, a reward of $25,000 was announced for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Coley could not claim the amount because the award was already due to expire.
Despite this, the nonprofit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time awarded the prize $5,000 and later received another $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the cleaners' honesty.
He's going to get $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that police questioned pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.

China has a new case of human avian influenza virus
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic bird flu virus H5N6 has been reported in China.
This was reported by RTHK radio station, citing a notification from the health authorities of Hong Kong, reports TASS.
The 68-year-old resident of Huayzhou City District in southern Guangdong province, who kept a domestic bird, contracted the infection.
His condition is being assessed as critical by the medical community.
The world's first human H5N6 strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, people who enter the country were required to have a passport, a decision made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from the certificate.
Also excluded are those who have arrived from countries where the lack of vaccines is proven.
"The situation is even more serious considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow", said Barroso.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities had obliged unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full protection against COVID-19 scheme unveiled
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, Russian scientist Anatoliy Altstein in a conversation with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
He said this could be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
When used internally, A immunoglobulins form in large quantities. When the vaccine is injected, this does not occur.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus can't get into the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most G-antibodies.
And if you get both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no solution yet for double vaccination", the doctor said.
UrFO chief prophylactologist, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help because in this case, the body's defense should be maximized.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Husseinov said that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new outbreak of COVID-19.
He said that this is the picture seen in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic has come earlier.
I mean, I'm not...
I talked to the cobel (who died a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to trade your warm house, your breastfeeding, your affection, your love and your games for a fluid bitch, go ahead.
But the singer was trained and clever.
I picked my company and went home.

I've stopped many owners from chasing a dog, even though they said there were 200,000 running away, and I've taken them by the hand and taken them to the other side.
The result was that the 200,000 chose the owner, not the dog that was running away.
Mass protests against vaccination in Europe are not ending
In Vienna, Austria, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed their displeasure with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against COVID mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spanish, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some had posters with the words, "This is a false pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
The authorities of several regions of the country have taken the decision to introduce sanitary passports amid a rise in the number of coronavirus cases.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
A group of protesters began throwing stones at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officials used water meters.
Nicholas C., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kasevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.

WHO has detected "omicron" in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the new strain of the coronavirus "omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO report said the strain was spreading rapidly.
The WHO said the strain had been detected in 63 countries, in all six regions, as of December 9.
That's despite the fact that it only started to spread actively in late November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that the new strain could bypass the Delta strain, the Indian variant of the coronavirus that is now the dominant strain in almost every country.
Before that, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus said the omicron-stamp could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also drawn in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the Omicron will repel Delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million, even though the official OCD is now a few hundred people in the Kingdom, and estimates are up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at its peak, more than 2,000 people will be admitted to hospitals every day.
What the British health system won't be able to handle.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower than other forms of the disease.
How the Russian "Sputnik V" will react to the "omicron" is not yet known - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalaia Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.

Israeli Prime Minister Bennett announced the start of vaccination in schools
Israel's health ministry is launching an emergency program to increase vaccination from Sunday.
Starting in the morning of December 12, coronavirus vaccination is being conducted in schools across Israel.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of the Jewish state said at today's Cabinet meeting that the issue of vaccinating at risk-grade citizens with the fourth dose would also be considered.

Russians warned of a new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began looking for new video-messaging fraud tactics.
This is what the news agency Izvestia reports, citing experts.
According to Zaur Abutalyamov, director of product for Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is the depreciation.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real footage of the victim.
This enables the neural network to accurately reproduce the behavior of a person.
Abutalyamov added that using a dipfake, attackers can call the victim's acquaintances via video or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person to send for blackmail.
"These counterfeits can easily provoke bullying, as a con man can put people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios", said the expert.
Alexander Vetkol, a senior systems engineer at Varonis, said that people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could pose specific risks when it comes to video technology.

Five steps to avoid diabetes
Blood sugar problems are among the most common problems in the world.
Some, however, do not take this seriously, and it is in vain.
In time, diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death.
Prevention measures play a major role in preventing disease formation.
For example, doctors recommend changing your drinking regimen - reducing the number of different drinks and switching to regular water can have a positive effect on your metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
So the first step to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying candy and keep it at home.
Not only is poor nutrition but also habits affected by the disease.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise you to eat a low-carb diet.
This diet not only helps you lose weight, but it also protects you from sudden fluctuations in your sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to satiety, digestive juices, and improved food absorption.

Dr. Pavlova told about "weekday migraines" in the work addicts
There are several factors that can cause a worsening of your health on weekends .
The cause of the deterioration of health after working days is often "weekday migraine", said the famous doctor-endocrinologist, medical science candidate, senior research employee of the faculty of fundamental medicine of the M.D.U., scientific head of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in his telegram channel.
She said that it is especially common for workers who have headaches, cramps and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue that has accumulated over the past week, there are many objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changes in conditions.
Our lives are changing dramatically over the weekend.
"We sleep long, lie on the couch all day, eat more, and drink less", the doctor argued.
"Because of over-eating and lack of water, weight and crushing".
The late rise is an additional factor.
So if you get up three hours later than usual, you'll have a reaction called jetlag.
It's caused by travelers crossing several time zones.
To determine which factors play a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended that we look at what changes most strongly on weekends.

South African scientists say Pfizer vaccine against Omikron is not very effective
South Africa has declared low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against OICON
Scientists from the South African Republic conducted a study and reported the low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against the omicron-stamp of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the neutralization level of "omicron") matches the vaccine's efficacy of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which... raises questions about the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, says a study published on MedRxiv.
At the same time, the experts said that the drug could save the disease from a severe course.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the micro-stamp of coronavirus could trigger a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is hidden in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrition.
Excess of the food can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Consumers should note that under an unfamiliar word, a hidden sugar ingredient may be indicated, similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names that essentially denote sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other broken sugars, such as dextrose (corn sugar), levulose (fruit sugar), melasses (black patch), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in a doctor's sausage, in bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce sugar intake, as stated in Roscache, is to consume whole and unprocessed foods, as well as to pay attention to the labels and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be significantly higher than the label indicates.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose its importance for Germany in 25 years
The new chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, said gas imports were losing importance for Germany as the country continued its transition to decarbonisation.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role", the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement that Berlin supported Ukraine's energy transformation.
Earlier, Germany's Foreign Ministry head Anna Anna Anna Berbok said the process of certifying the "North stream-2" gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, in the framework of coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline "does not yet meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers hacked the Twitter of India's prime minister
The hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to post a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked him to ignore the new messages.
The prime minister's representatives said Twitter responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
At the referendum in New Caledonia , the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, most New Caledonians voted against independence during a referendum.
The turnout in this third vote was much lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) voted "in favor" of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75 762) voted "no".
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80 thousand New Caledonians taking part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments, "the outcome of this election left no room for doubt", as independence supporters urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of COVID-19 in the archipelago is preventing a full and "honest" election campaign.
This non-participation thus paved the way for the third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists have said they will not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to address the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has largely revived the last weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have voiced support for the territory to remain part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French", Eric Zemmur repeatedly said.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Peckres, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position "because it's not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Casteux, for his part, expressed a "strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".

Readers of WSJ criticized the article on Russia-US relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article describing his vision of Russia-US relations.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly bringing Ukraine to the victims of Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow and admitted a number of offensive statements to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "act as a united front against Russia".
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the American professor's position.
"There is a lot of false information in this article", one reader commented to RIA Novosti.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine", another said.

This was reported on December 11 by the out-of-state adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president Alexei Arestovich.
I mean, they can take action against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish avionics: the body and the like", - quotes him Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA's aircraft, Arestowicz said that the aircraft were jet-powered, not piston-powered.
He said it was the next generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpassed it "in all respects".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant by the end of next year, Arestowicz concluded.
The ANKA flight apparatus was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff confidentially used Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the United Forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in the Kiev region to train staff, as well as test and service Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions have fled at Singapore's Chang'i airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container containing seven lions that had arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unclear from what country they were brought to Singapore and where they were going.
One of the escaped lions lies on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from him because of the safety net attached.
The fighting ended after the Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singaporean zoos, arrived at the airport.
They've disabled the lions with tranquility drones and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion had fled from its owner and was wandering the streets of the city.
That same day, the beast returned home voluntarily, with no injuries.
Specialists warned of the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies suggest that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express has warned of this.
Experts say there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid have a lower risk of certain cancers, including colorectal cancer.
However, the overdosage, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of nutrition at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Beth Kitchin, advises you to monitor your daily intake of folic acid.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if you deviate significantly from that figure to a greater or lesser extent.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor dosage and avoid milk cereals and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutritionist Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is also found in avocados, Fine recommended that men eat the fruit more often after age 50.
In the UK , by April , about 75 thousand people could die from the omicron stamp .
British scientists predict that up to 75,000 people could die in England over the next five months if restrictions are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the specialists, who are part of the British Cabinet's Emergency Scientific Advisory Group, by April 2022 there will be at least 25 thousand deaths from the omicron strain in the country, and a total of about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent overloads from the National Health Service if the omicron-stamp is more contagious than the delta variant and the existing vaccines cannot rule out infections", said LSHTM mathematician Rosanna Barnard.
The UK Health Safety Agency said that if the rate of spread of the omicron-stamp remains at the current level, there will be about 1 million cases by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the Omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
There are currently 1898 cases of omicron-stamp coronavirus in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On 9 December, the head of the UK's Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, said the figure could reach 10,000 cases.

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter globally
Superyachts are being built this year and orders for next year are breaking world records, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The world register of ships has ordered 1,200 yachts - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money to build a $50 million-pound or more fortress will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, they are increasing.
This year, we ordered 25% more ships than we did last year.
Brokers say there hasn't been a market like this in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet with their business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely and negotiate over the edge.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that the shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
That means customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it", he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The wealthy, sociologists say, don't want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on yachts or flying on their own planes is a public outrage, because the elite don't want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to act and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they realize that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to achieve.
Meanwhile, it's not just the number of superyachts ordered that impresses, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a length of feed greater than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Reckeke is building a 183-meter-long REV Ocean yacht.
When it comes down to the water, it'll be the biggest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed for exploring the sea depths.
The existing superyachts have commonly been helicopter racks, open-air movie theaters, and some, such as the fighter yacht of McGregor, are a platform for single-handed combat. Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is negligible.
But it's symbolic, considering that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is a thousand times greater than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 a year, the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33,9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of the emission trail was on his 162.5 meter long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and have the crew bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't feel sorry for others when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns the largest mine in the continent, complain on YouTube that their giant ships have nowhere to dock.
It's also hard to understand her call to build marinas for ships 50 meters long.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol that leads to bowel cancer is identified.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that drinking four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
The likelihood of developing the disease increases with increased alcohol consumption.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of cancer, but they note that certain factors lead to a process that is harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child .
Many, if not all, dog lovers believe that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't realize how advanced four-legged pets are.
For years, biologists have conducted various experiments to determine the intelligence of animals.
Although dogs do not have as extensive vocabulary as humans, a new study shows that dogs can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't know anything about politics, economics, or art, and they often manage to fool their owners.
Experts believe that some breeds have shown better results in understanding the words of human language, but statistics are not enough to draw accurate conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as Labrador.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and they are no less capable of learning than a two-year-old.

The United States and Russia have prepared for trade in Ukraine
The United States and Russia will "negotiate" Ukraine's NATO membership, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for the publication "Glavred".
He said Washington and Moscow plan to continue talks in the near future about the United States' guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of US leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you're offered something that's not acceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to trade, you're just sending the offer.
And in relation to Ukraine, there is a trade", wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"The training is conducted in secret, quickly and immediately, and they are moving to offensive actions, not waiting for the group to be detected and deployed by the counter-forces", he noted.
China is boosting the development of rail transport
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said company spokesman Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with this technology, which will ensure increased reliability and operational efficiency of the rolling stock.
China has significantly increased its rail transportation exports in the last six months, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-storey high-speed electric trains designed in China for export to Europe were withdrawn from the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began to be tested.
The train will run on the metro line connecting Istanbul's city centre to the city's airport.
The metro line will be open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment industry is one of the most innovative and internationally innovative industries", said Feng Yaoshan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Committee for International Trade Development.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's production of high-end equipment in the global market", said Feng Yaoshan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system with a complete set of auxiliary equipment and large-scale manufacturing activities.
According to Feng Yaoshan, the country is the first country in terms of railway electrification and high-speed and urban railway operation.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Biological science candidate Semen Gološekin in an interview with the radio Sputnik listed early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, to plan, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
There is currently debate that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it, the expert said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that doctors do not know effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, prevention should be started in time.
He said learning foreign languages and active communication would help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various ADDs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community", said Golosheikin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic", Golosheikin said.
Earlier, a UK charity for dementia research said the disease was increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors have named early symptoms of Alzheimer's.
The first sign of alarm is a vision problem that makes it difficult for the patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, as the authors call it, is aphasia, a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the doctors' council set up by the Georgia Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
The stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, change of character", - said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-nerve rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia", said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotage of medical care after the prison service staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
Georgian politicians quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore themselves to their former rights.

Protests against COVID passports in Spain
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate have been held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, reports Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was about 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
With their banners, they accused the state of totalitarianism and urged citizens to respect their choices.
Vaccination passports will also be required in Valencia to enter enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been identified since the pandemic began, more than 88 thousand patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people.
The government introduced a draft law on a single system of QR codes in the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, public food and retail facilities with either a certificate of vaccination or a disease transferred, or a vaccination medicine.
The same rules will be applied to travel by train and plane.

The Rise of the Curve: How the Chinese Are Turning into Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million people to winter sports, which will raise the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but will also contribute to the economic development of the backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiazhou, located near the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction, the region is also being greenered: workers plant trees.
There are over 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiazhou, there are snow problems.
The main long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become full-time.
But that is a long way off.
Games adviser Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, China's ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, Downs believes.
Many of the resorts are located in rural and mining areas.
These regions still have to be actively developed and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, Beijing built a high-speed railway from Chongli to Chongqing, and now no local is without a job.
More and more shops are opening in the country selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, they open up a food court with national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is committed to building a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and facilities must reach world-class status.
More than 500 million people worldwide could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO said
More than 500 million people worldwide could be thrown into extreme poverty by the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed human progress on universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and the World Health Organization (WHO) published two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic caused a breakdown in health services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
For the first time in 10 years, the number of people vaccinated has decreased, and the number of deaths from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
WHO and the World Health Organization stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people have become more difficult to pay for treatment".
This situation puts more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic has driven more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people virtually without social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister suspended from broadcasting at the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
Taiwan's digital technology minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Democracy Summit" was translated into video-free mode, according to a YouTube video recording of the summit.
Reuters, citing sources, claims the image was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map that marked Taiwan in a separate color from the PRC, which considered the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tang was compiled by the South African NGO CIVICUS and ranks the countries of the world by their degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was green as "free", and China, the DPRK, Laos and Vietnam as "closed" and red.
After the minister showed the map, a picture of her side was taken on a screenshot, noting that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
The PRC was not invited to the "Great Democracy Summit".
Reuters sources say the map, which the Taiwanese minister has demonstrated, could go against Washington's "one China" policy.
One agency source said that after the map was shown, the U.S. National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, chief editor of "New Gazette", Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money raised through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

The New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board has made a suborbital flight.
Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11.
The trip, which was broadcast on the company's website, lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the passenger capsule landed on Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the carrier rocket was conducted from the spaceport near the American city of Van Horn (Texas).
The ship climbed to a height of just over 100 km, leaving space tourists unable to lift.
The rocket-carrier itself landed on the spaceport site.
Blue Origin successfully completed the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard on July 20 with passengers on board.

I guess it's just in education that...
The chosen (and self-selected) parents dictate their own rules, without regard for the existing ones.
What if it goes into other areas of life, court proceedings, and so on?
The laws aren't written for them.
What if Dad still introduced his own method of upbringing and education?
Chewing on someone and setting an example is bad.

The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the PRC has issued a circular ordering to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land-based checkpoints are located, in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result within 48 hours of departure.
Those who come to cities with land-based transit points must take at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids upon arrival.
The document says that these requirements will be in effect from the day the relevant provincial level administrative units define and publish the zones of the cities, until March 15, 2022.
It is also noted that cities with land-based pass points and which meet certain conditions may consider creating buffer zones for COVID-19 prevention and control within their jurisdiction.

Foreign Ministry reported on "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Foreign Ministry Deputy Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia evaluated the prospects of Moscow and Washington's relations.
He noted that the long road of cooperation has led to sad conclusions and that the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There's a negative predictability, but in some ways, the prospect of improving relationships is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey we've made with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday", the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's desire to impose approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about prospects for improvement of relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, except for areas like strategic stability and cybersecurity, there is no progress.
Russia is urging the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, said Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned of the danger of nasal vaccination against COVID outside hospitals
People who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 can become allergic and need medical attention, so the first places to get vaccinated should not be in airports or shopping malls.
This was reported by the TASS virologist, member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the bionatechnology, microbiology and virology laboratory of the Novosibirsk state university Sergey Netesov.
It's easier to set up nasal vaccination centers at airports and malls, but I would do it in the first place only in medical facilities.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable that the person then sits next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work in a minute or two, which sometimes is very necessary", said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping malls once you have experience with the drug.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets into the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person is screened after injection.

In the UK, 1239 cases of new coronavirus omicron-stamp have been detected in a single day.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the Omicron strain have been recorded in England, 38 people have been infected with the new strain in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia and not suffer", the Kremlin's official spokesman said on the "Russia 1" television channel.
Peskov claims that it is "understood by everyone in the world".
Earlier, it was reported that the United States considers the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
The head of the Federal Reserve, Herman Greff, is convinced that this is impossible.

New Caledonia residents rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of the voters voted against independence.
They supported independence from France by 3.51% of the population of the archipelago in the southern Pacific.
They canceled 2.99% of the ballots.
The voting rate was very low: about 55% of the island's residents came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to the separatists' calls to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France.
In 2018, the region had already held a referendum on independence.
Most residents supported the archipelago's location in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
The archipelago is home to about 270 thousand people, and the territory is granted a special administrative and territorial status.
An agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration was signed in 1998, according to which the region can hold a vote on its independence twice, with a difference of two years.

WHO has previously considered Omicron to be less dangerous than Delta.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said that the omicron is less dangerous than the delta-stamp of the coronavirus.
There are also data on vaccine effectiveness decreases in the new COVID-19 variant.
As of December 9, Omicron is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigen profile of the Omicron strain protein suggest a decrease in vaccine effectiveness against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than in "delta"", says the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all recorded cases of OIC infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain is reportedly spreading faster than the Delta.
In Russia, two cases of omicron-stamp infection have been recorded.
They were "previously immunized", reported the Gamalaia Center.
The head of the Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, said that there are no reliable data yet that the new variant of coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky were named
Former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denysenko listed four options for the development of events for Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also compromise on Donbass.
This was reported on Sunday, December 12, by Denisenko in a post on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm", suggests that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine by reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
This development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"Parallel to this is the decline in prices for key goods that we traditionally export, internal protests and opposition from the government to key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.) ", - added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will be made in the event of high turbulence in world politics, where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership may compromise on the Donbas, which could lead to a confrontation within the country.
By the end of summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, is 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of population groups disagreeing with Zelensky and the president, which is likely to lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In the course of this crisis, Zelensky will begin to "reform the government", Denizenko added.
Another scenario is that Zelensky will become the "father of the nation".
This could be the result of an event that will cause a major social upheaval.
"The event should be large enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine", Denizenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of "attacks" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that were increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the data of a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation where in the case of the upcoming presidential elections, only 21.8% of voters would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for former President Petro Poroshenko.
Yet, among all those surveyed, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Arrested for the action on Red Square, the poet: "For a quote from Yvtshenko, 10 days is given, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A high school student was arrested on Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetrussiyaborshechemper.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtshenko.
Alexander was charged with repeatedly violating the order of holding a public action.
He was first arrested on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, but now interest in it has been lost, unfortunately, to the decline of the culture in Russia and there is little hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag", explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to reveal more details of the message.
How did the police treat you when you were arrested this time and before?
What did the department ask you about, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the staff was more correct, the most detained, polite, as ridiculous as that sounds in some context of the word.
Pushkin's got the Omon's and they got the hard ones.
They asked me the usual, the motive.
When you hear, you look, if not appreciatively, then understandingly.
Except for the four-sided monkey, everything was perfectly fine, but I knew what I was getting at.
And if after the campaign, a few people start writing their own poems under that hashtag, I'm gonna spend the next 10 days sitting there.

Researchers have shown how potatoes help with age-related disorders
Research has shown that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol.
The root fruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantotene acids.
All of these elements help the body's systems function.
Potatoes also help to combat age-related disorders.
Because of its high clitoral content, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and when consumed regularly, it can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root crop is best to be dried or cooked rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as could other high-glycemic foods.
These are carbohydrate-rich foods that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction in its production in private subsidiary farms and the increase in processing capacities.
Market participants believe that the current product shortage will only replace imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the Yandex release.
Candidates for the flight
In 2015, rights holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director general of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive, including regularly changing their domain names, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in both Yandex and Google search, you can view pirated copies of Netflix's "Game of the Dove" and "Tenderness" by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (included in AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can watch the animated feature Encanto, but judging by the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen (a pirated copy of the movie made in a movie theater).
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, has a TV channel TNT's "University 10 years later" series (which is part of Gazprom-media).

The "Micropakets" are the most high-frequency of the DiMax spring blocks, so they have a distinct orthopedic effect and are considered premium.
Fillers: above and below the springs are combinations of layers of coira and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut bark.
This kind of filling tandem has long held the status of a classic, since it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coira provides proper back support, the latex adapts the surface to the human body.
The model comes in a simple Aloe Vera knitted jacket.
It can be rented or used in a stationary location.
The total height of the product is  27 cm, the recommended load for the bed is  170 kg.

The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is certified CertiPUR.
Estonian scientists will be looking for life on Venus
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year launch mission is to assess the viability of Venus' clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, the Tarut scientists offered tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
It was previously thought that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
During the third mission, a probe from Venus is due to arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to earthly life or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life originated on Earth", said Mikkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonia-based Venus Life Finder project.

The meta-universe will change Russian business
The topic of meta-population became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was turning into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the biggest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, businesses in Russia, like the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metatarsals and monetizing them.
Metauniverse should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards distance interaction in a pandemic environment is that people are tired of being separated and restricted.
On the other hand, it's the result of businesses' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
And third, they're a logical continuation of the digital asset trend, where any rights, securities, artwork, and even money are being digitized.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too fat or harmful.
Of course, we'll have a traditional olive and a saddle under the skirt for the party, but no one's forcing me to eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try it, and that's it.
After all, there are really ten days ahead, and you can cook any delicious and nutritious dishes.
And how much hell of a job, time, and resources it took her to train.
And after five quarter-jumps, she ran out of gold.
And she also understands that she won't last four years until the next Olympics, that is, she'll never be an Olympic champion.
And if you've never been in a sport or you can't imagine all the hellholes you've been through, don't go down with a shock.
British economist failed to give forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 because he believed such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is second, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in commodity prices was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless central bank generosity has already recovered" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking inflation into account, will correlate with the expected growth rates of GDP.
O'Neill noted that amid the pandemic, the continuation of overly soft economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, productivity growth, poverty and climate change are also to be addressed, O'Neill summed up.
Earlier, the head of the Global Studies Department of Opening Investments, Mikhail Schulgin, said that the positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar's exchange rate, Schulgin named the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears over the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But the good news is that, if you compare yourself to yourself, there were fewer containers five years ago.
It's better now.
Progress is slow.
There's another problem: cities have a lot of environmental initiatives, but people don't know about them.

Russians gave auto dealers about 4,5% of the country 's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI) show.
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is the leading company in Russia in terms of revenue.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The related brand Kia Hyundai has a significant growth of more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279,3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions this brand and by the increase in the average weighted price of the car - in a year with Hyundai it has grown by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the stronger dynamics of the increase in price was only with Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands have not increased so much: according to statistics of the Committee of Car Manufacturers of the European Business Association in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
Toyota is the third largest car manufacturer in terms of sales in terms of money - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles in 10 months on cars of this brand, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has also increased sales volume (by 37%), and the average weighted price of the car (by almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is seeing a good increase in sales and an average price - more than, for example, BMW - hence a greater increase in financial capacity", said NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabadji.
The growth rate of sales is fantastic, with Chinese brands also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year".
Russian Lada shows average market performance (plus 28%) for cars of this brand Russians spent 229,4 billion rubles in 10 months.
Last year's financial capacity was lower than that of companies that dropped their sales in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
The U.A.A.Z. and the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups for 10 months against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of the problems with the supply of auto components and the disruptions in production, which have encompassed the entire world auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AutoVAZ" increased the price of Lada models seven times a year, the last increase in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly rewrite price tags for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volume of the Russian automobile market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car shortage, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of auto companies to make up for past losses, experts say.
In the context of the car shortage, I think many car companies have even been able to transfer to the consumer in part the costs of past periods that they could not have put into the price of cars before,
According to VTB Capital analyst for the automotive industry, Vladimir Bespalov.
I think the carmakers are feeling very good financially right now, keeping a high margin of sales".
The side-effect indicator of this is the growth rate of the value of cars that is observed during 2021, with new car prices rising faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long run, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and money, but mainly due to inflation and the complication of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As the supply increases, the opportunity to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian auto market will continue to grow and in the coming year, even if the growth of the value of cars slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income through volumes, says independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergei Burgasliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are seeking to get the most profit from each car sold, Burgasliev notes.
The increase in the production of cars is not expected in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is heating up by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
The expert says that in the market situation, cars are a good investment vehicle - a car bought a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold at a higher price than the original price.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US military to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
This is the statement made by President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans", the White House chief said, answering a reporter's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
He also stressed that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for Ukraine's defense is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would transfer its forces to the NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We're going to have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect from any Russian attack", Biden said.
Earlier, Russian President Dmitry Peskov's spokesman stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukraine.
He also pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the military use of the Turkish-supplied drones by Kiev, as well as the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I'm gonna drop this interview right now.
If I'm being asked to scream, wait for hours, drink a bottle of wine and wash a glass, it's scary to imagine what's going to happen at work.

If a fraudster calls from a number like an "Inland Affairs employee" or another law enforcement agency, it's not very effective to immediately drop it, and blacklisting it is unlikely to be successful.
Because to prove his lie about being involved in the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and persuade.
