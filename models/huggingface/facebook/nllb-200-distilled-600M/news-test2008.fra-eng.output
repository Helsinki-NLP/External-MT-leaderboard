Inflation in Europe has been driven by a drop in food prices
The accelerated inflation rate in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, prices in the 13 euro area countries rose more than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent, the European Community Statistics Office in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts have only shown 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the key interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, together with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to a spiraling inflation.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to 2%.
One analyst said that this was the catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be discouraged" so that it would not have to be addressed later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record over the past 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to rapidly rising food and energy prices.
The future market shares of cereals increased by 88 per cent and the price of soybeans also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world's oil price has increased by 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 in 2008 to 2.5% this year but will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, but the next three to four months the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup points to a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the Fidesz (Young Democratic Alliance) supporters increased significantly in early December, and it now has the largest number of supporters since 2002, compared to a previous low 13 percent of the Socialist support from Gallup (Survey Institute).
For loyal voters, the difference would be, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, support of more than two thirds (71%) against support of a fifth (20%) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent of the population.
Among the loyal voters who were certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been higher, rising to 41% and 46% further say the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of the past spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening situation and only one tenth expects an improvement.
Last December, 71 percent of respondents - a majority that has never been seen in previous Gallup polls - felt that the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
Thirteen percent of the respondents trust or have a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent have no confidence in the Prime Minister and 27 percent in the Fidesz chairman.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society who think that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the October riots 35 percent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, the current rate is only 20 percent.
When asked about voting intentions, 60 percent of respondents said they would definitely vote and the other 20 percent said they would probably.
In comparison, for a "parliamentary election next Sunday", only 55% of the respondents would certainly participate and an additional 15% would probably.
74 percent of people would say no to higher education tuition fees, 79 percent would say no to counseling fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital stays.
If we look only at the same proportions of people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital accommodation fees, respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent.
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs business triangle maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, while this year the VAT rate did not increase.
The article by Napi Gazdaság (Economy of Everyday Life)
This year, in the Budaörs business triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also grew by an average of 16 percent, with a value increase of well over a thousand forints being seen in all supermarkets.
Prices, which had already skyrocketed in the grocery store in December, have not risen sharply from the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below 9,000 forints last year now cost more than 10,000 forints.
The daily shopping basket in the supermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of at least 91, 000 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 this was HUF 6,800.)
Prices of unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices of turkey, walnut and duck have risen sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Statistical Institute) but in Auchan, bread weighed only one kilogram at 139 forins.
Competition did not bring the price of the product below HUF 200.
It was surprising that, even in this supermarket, the price of the bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was less than FIR 200 and therefore the bottle included only FIR 257.
But this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora raised the price of her daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan raised them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing the most expensive shopping cart last year with the cheapest shopping cart this year, we see a 12 percent gap whereas the difference between the cheapest and the most expensive shopping cart last year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1 480 forints.
Last year prices increased by an average of 1 206 forints, although the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticeable in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has made trade confusing, hypermarkets being unable to clearly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price changes on consumers.
(If a trader miscalculated the rotation of a product, he could lose a large profit on the margin adjusted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the daily basket has been so excessive that the most expensive basket was HUF 1 720 above the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was HUF 844 only.
This year the difference was not so great, as the value of the most expensive basket was HUF 1 630 higher than last year and the prices of the least expensive basket also increased HUF 1 284.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic rise in prices, with prices of everyday consumer goods rising by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some basic foods, the Statistical Institute has seen prices rise by more than 30% in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the latter's daily basket, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, which was already very expensive last year, has risen by just over 10% compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the brutal price increase to be accepted by multinational companies as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they are constantly recording good years.
In our experience, most customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets they visit.
They buy everything in bulk, they take the long-term food in palette.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the three supermarkets' boxes as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, we have heard that the turnover is less important in the province, and many multinationals complain to survey companies that they are not even reaching the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mostly caused by the misuse of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the lack of beds, and the overworking of medical staff do not help to prevent infections, says the chief physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save money on disinfectants
A few years ago, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected in a man hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
Earlier this year, a similar infection occurred at the same location.
The man who was seriously injured in a car accident was released from the hospital but soon afterwards had to return because of an MRSA infection and since then doctors have been unable to perform any major surgery on him because of the bacteria in his body.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Hospital Monitoring System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Which is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as angina, amygdala, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used in an excessive or inappropriate manner, the bacteria, which respond well to antibiotics, will develop a resistant bacteria that will quickly proliferate in bad hospital conditions.
If the immune system temporarily or for a long time fails to function properly, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly, underweight or weakened patients.
According to the hospital's chief physician János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of everyday life in hospitals.
The most important thing is not to confuse infection with epidemic, because MRSA is not only found in the area or not looked for, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The A.S. is resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff are wearing rubber gloves and protective masks, and we have antibiotics to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients who are hospitalized are examined in advance for MRSA, but infection cannot always be prevented.
The sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is mainly seen in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not the trend in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases only emerge if MRSA infection is detectable in the patient, said the chief medical officer of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts are needed to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, that is, microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs spread from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the health of the patients is not affected by the disease.
MRSAs spread through infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and contact, but due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, while in the case of epidemics, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in financial difficulty, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the number of patients is high, so the risk of contamination is even higher, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the spread of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why the fight against this infection is everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this programme is effective and MRSA infections are showing a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identifies among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs as well) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was involved in a fatal accident, was not drunk.
The official statement on the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It is possible that the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has since resigned from his post, who crushed a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, was driving drunk or dizzy, said Attila Morvai, spokesman for the capital's public ministry, on Friday after the findings were made.
The findings confirmed the first result of the investigation which already found that the former Commissioner had not drunk alcohol before he started driving.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the 22nd District police station crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself facing him when he was driving his own car through Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd District.
(After all, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, as the Road Code states that a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
The Commissioner resigned from his post following the accident and asked to retire because, according to the police report, the accident had left him very upset.
The investigation of this case is being carried out by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner had cooperated from the outset with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
The Commission will also be able to provide a detailed report on the implementation of the programme.
Hungary's Finance Minister János Veres and the European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday for a credit line totalling EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, a credit agreement of EUR 100 million having already been signed by the parties.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a €50 million contract for innovation, which will be used primarily by the State budget for the research and development project at the University of Debrecen.
The project for line 4 of the subway was also discussed during the negotiations.
The parties agreed that they would renegotiate the possible amendment of the initial contract once Hungary has finalized the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for financing 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitments.
Bulgaria, the EU real estate market paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of all Europe has turned to this country in the Balkans, which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market which is still the cheapest but which will soon become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular destination in Eastern Europe for real estate with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sables", the "Sunshine Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but there are increasing numbers looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik areas as well.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also attract investors and they are also increasingly buying in the cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf destinations in Europe and thus a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time trying to change their lives, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly Romania.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures taken are not distorted.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to move in buy renovated buildings, which cost between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old houses that are in disrepair, which cost between 5 and 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication, proximity to a large city, shops and in general the proximity of the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary home buyers (Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany since last December).
The third group is comprised of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium or long-term value added.
The price of buildings in the capital is rising constantly as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but they have increased by 21 percent each year over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the press release from Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the professional meetings will end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the ministers' negotiations on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is expected to define efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol's emission reduction period until 2012.
At present, there is a lively discussion on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that at the moment it did not wish to discuss exact figures, but was willing to sign an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, apart from reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors likely within the framework of the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), said Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as a flagship in global climate protection efforts and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by 2020 irrespective of whether the Agreement was successfully signed after 2012, and was ready to reduce them to 30% if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also willing to make commitments appropriate to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries had all set a target of reducing emissions by 5.2 per cent and that all 15 EU members at the time had committed to an 8% reduction.
Hungary has committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the 1985-87 period.
The challenge is high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the agreement's entry into force would certainly be postponed beyond 2012. In this case, commitments to reduce below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body that won the UN Nobel Peace Prize for its work on climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
The British Army units report on the video sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in an attempt to make themselves popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: Special Operations Units in Afghanistan have been uploading video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These recordings, taken using miniature headset cameras, are monitored at the Air Force Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London or uploaded to the Internet by the compatriots.
The political message is essential
The Air Force has already posted 139 footage on the network and their "chain" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The UK Ministry of Defence joined the group as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and it is releasing videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Keeping Force in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the Air Force's initial objective, the videos were posted online for recruitment and, according to the Ministry of Defense, were also used to inform the general public about the actual objectives of the military's presence abroad.
Propaganda published by this means costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, said defence consultant Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC.
The Americans played a game.
The army is upset because, apart from the videos that are carefully composed and censored, amateur videos have been posted on the sharing site that also show, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in the propaganda films official, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the battle.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the Internet showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on real missions, but the British military has only recently been packing up for the upload of these videos.
The Americans recruit a little differently using the free-to-download America's Army shooter game, in which the player can directly take the place of the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas towels and cookies in the ministry
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with cookies and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, another will charm the officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, this is how power is entertained.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence but not the Ministry's employees will be invited.
At Christmas, orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, at Missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere of the end of the year.
Compared to other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4 320 000 forints and, out of the 600 wholesale employees, 350 are expected to attend.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (NJC) with concerts and a dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million forints, the rest being spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, the tender management company.
The building of the Theatre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt as we have not been able to contact the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building was not only home to the NFÜ but also to the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on St. Luca's Day on 7 December.
The OIT did not charge them for the use of its halls.
The ball was attended by five hundred people.
The party began with the minister's greeting and dinner was followed by a live music dance.
Answer to [origo's] question: The evening dress was not at all mandatory at this ball.
The health, labour and local authorities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will host a show and party for its employees on its walls for 400,000 forints.
However, Mónika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her colleagues to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
Around 180 people are expected to be invited to a coffee and cake, the press service said, and the cost of the party will be 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large hall, which is expected to attract 436 employees.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since János Veres arrived, the PM's employees have been celebrating Christmas in the same way every year.
The official nature of the party is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the time of the party in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organise a reception on 20 January to celebrate the New Year, there will be no Christmas celebration.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the town centre, and according to the ministry's statement, 1,000 for each person is calculated for each hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The cocktails, held annually, begin with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services told [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the official Christmas price.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the celebration at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee on Friday, which will coordinate the strike on Monday.
A general protest meeting will be held on Saturday and the strike will begin on Monday, the day of the final vote on the health funds bill.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The union's unions will announce the details of their strike on Monday, organised with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike committee of LIGA-MOSZ will also be set up, and will be the coordinator of Monday's actions.
A general protest meeting will be held on Saturday and, starting Monday, the organisations joining the strike will suspend work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Insurance Act, is not set.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what to do next.
The agenda of the National Assembly on Monday suggests that the vote on the health funds bill will likely take place late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the planned strike on Monday, traffic is expected to be heavily blocked: railways will stop working indefinitely and in the morning some public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies may be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half the road will be blocked as well.
Many unions and civil organisations joined the call for the strike, and the list is updated on the League's website.
Some organisations report an indefinite strike, others have declared a temporary stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railways (VDSZSZ) had not been able to reach an agreement on minimum services, but as Christmas approaches, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Electricity and Thermal Energy Industry Unions of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for two hours and two hours to eight hours respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike nationwide in alternating stages, and the SZEF-affiliated Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ) will strike for two hours.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new design to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating pensions to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim is a guarantee of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the system to carry out the functions it deserves before 2010.
The fourth ground for action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railways (VDSZSZ), affiliated to the League's trade unions, of the proposal from the Ministry of Economy and Transport on secondary railways and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was established in August last year with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
In its  Risk Warning , the company notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that  in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur following the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary .
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors:  public actors have shifted the public debate on the Roma issue to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based their political strategy on the dispute between the Roma and the Hungarians 
The problem is getting worse, normal dialogue is becoming impossible, extremists are being strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
According to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard's activity has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, particularly in terms of confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity.
They recall that following increased publicity given to the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 under the name of National Self-Defense Association.
 The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their members for defence missions (disaster, national defence, law enforcement), armed if necessary, and, moreover, citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state , they added.
They reported that everything was done according to a method which, based on the resentment of the political and party society, seeks to disguise different political ambitions as a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil status and the status of associations thus serves not only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering such associations in court but also to constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a factor that increases the risk compared to neighbourly relations.
 In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This is affecting the political stability of the region, they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not unique to Central and Eastern Europe, as political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma riots that broke out in a neighbourhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) were the cause of the establishment of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UN decided to set up a guard, saying that the organisation's objective is  national self-defense .
They say that over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have terrorized Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked a lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some organizations of Bulgarian Roma about the constitution of their own guard as a form of resistance signals an increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard, which is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, does not exclude the possibility that Hungarian Roma respond to the threat in the same way by organising their own self-defense, as stated in the Risk Warning of Political Capital.
At the request for information from the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could impact the change in risk, they inform the public about it, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party's not marked red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law defines the exact dates of the holidays, and around the holidays it has become common to reorganize the number of working days that will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
The holiday is often associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that those who wake up can rest in peace.
In addition, in one year we have a total of eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as is October 23 which is the anniversary of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the state's constitution, May 1st is Labor Day, and November 1st and 2nd, we remember our deceased family members and friends.
We also have two days for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Our national and religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, but according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the red-marked holiday.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has laid down specific rules on the days to replace the days before or after the holidays.
The law applies to all employers and all their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not apply to service companies, however, as institutions are continuously running and in service, by their vocation, and also for the rest days.
This year, the working days will only be changed around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December onwards, life will almost cease throughout the country because experience shows that most people work overtime or take vacations that they have saved up for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around Labour Day to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day, with a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
But next year, the end of the year is marked by holidays, because from December 24th, everyone will be on a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can be terribly annoying to colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, voicemails we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost the most: these are things that make everyday workplace beauty.
The question is whether you get used to these problems or you take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing others trouble.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department", a colleague told you.
That you missed an appointment?
At best, he's sorry and tries to make things right by calling the marketing department to tell them he forgot to pass the message (that's the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before you give a hard explanation, it is helpful to consider how you can cause unpleasant moments for your coworkers and to make an effort to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, a desk tool or a phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the handkerchief on the desk and it disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your pen you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your coworkers without asking, or they'll be right to be angry at you for taking their property.
Don't bring back envelopes, put them in your pocket because it can be annoying that they're gone and you need them right away.
You're talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the spread of poison.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information about your colleagues' privacy.
If a coworker shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust.
Keep the shared information inside of you and do not discuss it with your colleagues when he is not there, even if your colleagues are aware of it too.
You're declaring yourself sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself ill under the guise of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your futures must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your coworkers!
If you know in advance that you will not be working the next day or that something may happen that will force you to stay home, remember to tell your boss and colleagues so that they may not be surprised by your absence the next day.
He was a man of many talents.
You get into your work, but the ridicule of your coworkers just takes you away?
You unwittingly witnessed a phone conversation that you would have better not listened to?
Do not disturb your fellow workers by whining, singing, talking out loud (which you are leading over their heads), clapping, or expressing your displeasure out loud.
They can be disturbing even if your colleagues are not involved in a project (writing, designing, organizing).
You blame others for a mistake?
If your work is not done by the time you have set, you forget to send a letter or an important message, don't blame anyone for that forgetfulness.
Don't think of it as a result of the chaos in the office or your noisy coworkers.
If you have done something wrong and it has caused others to stumble, admit it and make amends.
Ask how you could fix your mistake, fix your negligence!
Do you feel too much at home at the office?
Running and running shoes are comfortable at home but they're not suitable for the office!
Don't wear comfortable jogging, even if your job allows it!
Don't be neglected, but honor yourself and your colleagues by dressing yourself properly, and if your job requires you to wear decent and elegant clothes when you go to work.
If you want to live up to expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We're moving slowly into the usual morning clutch.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio - the sound of a violin with electronic effects.
I'll turn up the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the early notes, then a female choir comes to join it like a real jewel.
Mr2 is playing Zagar's Wings of Love.
Hungarian music life didn't spoil us for long with high-quality electronic pop.
Now, I hear the plug is getting different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall picture and, despite the new garage rock style tearing the guitar apart, Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Beijing and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he started on his own path, perhaps because there is no room for two feet in the same shoe.
His project (Zagar) and music, a mixture of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to gain recognition when he was commissioned to compose soundtracks for films (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The band's early club career began to gain wider exposure when wan2 magazine named their 2002 debut album among the top 50 albums in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would be as competitive in the West.
Zagar and his team have undoubtedly become trendy but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted well, they released a new and better record.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new avenues for them, although the title is intended to represent a continuation of their years in Beijing.
It's that it was a line from the old Pécs group of Balázs Zságer.
We're right there with the reference to the flight but next to the aerial music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the album's premiere at Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real radio tube, Mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began introducing the Wings of Love tunes recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So, is everything okay?
H.V.G.hu has asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
Hvg.hu: This new tube makes me ask a question: has your music really remained music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music for a certain layer doesn't mean much to me.
For me, there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be poor and made only to sell and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The receptive attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
ZSB: Overseas, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not just young people in their teens or twenties but also older people.
They are watching the changes in light music much more closely because they think it's also part of contemporary culture.
What is the role of the public in your work?
Do you care who, or how many people, listen to your music?
ZSB: I'm obviously glad to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made for a purpose but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or the mutual influence is already working but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
But I've noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you wouldn't be interesting anymore.
Are you going to follow Yonderboi's lead?
He works alone and has a career in the west.
ZSB: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi's because many of us were leaving his band and taking a different path.
In Mr. Petõfi's chart, Wings of Love is number one.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
ZSB: We didn't plan on making a record so we could sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try and soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes covered throughout the record.
How did you choose the six singers?
Why did they - what was the guideline?
ZSB: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The six-member choir was composed of Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who later became known as Underground Divas.
HW: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a little bit?
ZSB: This song was already in an instrumental version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing in this song.
The sequence of chords attracted the song's voice.
I sang the song that the girls later learned that night.
I got it almost immediately and it was all terribly spontaneous.
I remember it got me excited at the time but I'm pretty sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
HG: On the record and at the concert too, it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There's no solo (except for a short Judy Jay solo), they don't have a solo role, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than the music, so the music just goes along with their singing.
They were back on stage, too.
Is that what you want?
ZSB: The fact that they were in the background is due to technical problems only.
But what we did was volunteer, we didn't want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says we have to forget a little bit about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted others to feel the same euphoria that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs did you most work on?
ZSB: To be honest, no, no, no, no, no, no. We didn't have any more difficult pieces in the mixing process.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, it all got set up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
ZSB: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already released this record.
Right now, it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A fraudulent con man.
This is the name of the former employee of the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost five billion euros because of him.
It seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
"He's fragile", his superiors implied, reporting him to the police.
However, according to Kerviel's statement reported by French media, including Le Monde, his transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis is beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he said in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to make half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that subprime loans, which were granted to low-income customers or those who had had previously had difficulty repaying them, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet.
At the end of the year, the company's profits were EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I had earned my first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it", Kerviel confides, adding that he had, of course, kept nothing for himself".
During the whole interrogation, he admitted to having distorted reports so as not to be examined.
He managed to trick his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Whoever doesn 't risk anything has nothing .
Did he want to be discovered?
I'm not sure.
"I thought that just getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them".
What's the big risk he's willing to take?
He only got to his post gradually.
He started working for Société Générale in 2000 right after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader, and in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
But he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was far less respected than others.
In view of my university studies and my professional and personal journey", Kerviel told investigators.
But soon after his inauguration, he had his first major success.
Allianz's shares earned him half a billion euros by betting on the loss of that title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered -- he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone.
"It was like a snowball effect", he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As I won, they pretended to close their eyes".
But then comes the start of the year.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious because of his vacation.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another", concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
The Czech government's ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could contribute 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion kroner from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the financial resources available to the Czech Republic under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to raise financial means to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Businesses should be able to obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
The Czech Republic has so far been among the least successful recipients of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal has confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
Nicaragua's Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence of former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of defrauding the country of $100 million.
But he was later released and sent to live in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be re-arrested is unclear at this time, according to the AP.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals Ileana Pérez, it will all now depend on the prison guards, either they let Aleman finish his sentence at home or he goes back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved that Alemán regularly transferred government money to foreign corporate accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies, and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Some of that money went to the funds that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
We have adopted the budget
That's right.
The State budget has been adopted.
What is the exceptional nature of this budget?
This is the first budget that this government has designed and accepted by the majority of the government without the support of the opposition.
The current one was completed a year ago with the support of the Czech Socialist Party - the ČSSD, since it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford to refuse.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote on the government's motion of no confidence, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House passed this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually overlooked.
That's a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and the end of any government.
Budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media, which is why it gets more media attention.
The political controversies are much more of an interest to opinion than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the previous socialist governments suffered from three ills which the current budget cannot solve at once:
The first is the large share of the legal mandate costs, which consist not only of pensions but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, the deficit in the State budget is not the biggest area.
This is public and relatively controlled.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds, stunned, and overly indebted their municipalities in order to obtain new sources of investment, apart from tax, tax and bank credits.
In previous years, they were able to repay these debts by selling in bulk the shares in the distribution systems, particularly those in the energy sector, obtained from the State through privatisations.
Today, they no longer have that source.
If we only follow the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been in a growth phase for several years now, as has the rest of the world, and the DRC is keen to see it.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania and Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame that is largely due to previous governments.
We are among the countries that are the least threatened by poverty globally.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, unfortunately, become unnecessarily inflated in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been removed, if a change in the retirement age and pension reforms are not coming soon, then all politics will cease to exist in this country and anyone in power will only be running.
It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats who will mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenditure to be pushed back by mandate expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not wasted all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and taxation.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.
The Commission has decided to extend the period of validity of the decision.
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will be put on the money markets through auctions.
The banks will be able to sell the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money by means of an auction system.
For example, the US Fed will auction out $40 billion and will also provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual States have decided on such concerted action to prevent or even lessen the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend", writes Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
"The concerted action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent", Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more to be lost.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what may still follow", says ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after the London Interbank Rate, called LIBOR, which was used to borrow on the interbank market, failed to be lowered.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and England had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates", says Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will help to address the crisis, as it does not address the main problem of the fall in the US housing market.
President Klaus: The debate by environmentalists is incredible
Global climate change is expected to affect developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has fallen on the UN's international climate conference ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not Green, he said that the environmentalists' debates were incredible.
Klaus said that not only the structure of the conference, which is made up of a curious mix of government and non-governmental organizations, was unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that accompanied it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, a substitute for solutions to current problems", said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, at the presentation of his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinions".
Now interested persons can read his views without distorting them.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climate scientist, he still feels he has enough resources to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific papers, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, he says, the following theses: climate is constantly changing, climate change is therefore normal, there is not a shared view of global warming by all researchers, the effects of current changes are neither too great nor too serious, they therefore pose no danger, and finally efforts to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
He has also been a victim of totalitarian regimes and he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but an environmentalist environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between costs and profits".
Klaus talked about this in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people have failed to renew their driving licence on time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still apply for a renewal so that the authorities can issue a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid driving licences will take the road.
Authorities say they have not renewed their driving licence, especially for those who no longer wish to drive.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of renewal applications, authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of renewal applications has increased this week.
The town hall caters to about 2,000 customers a day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140,000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
It takes 20 days to get a new permit.
However, it is possible to request release within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to complete the mandatory renewal of their driving licence by the end of the year and who take the road without a valid licence will face fines from January.
The guilty party will be required to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine is increased to 2500 kroner.
According to old reports, even a person who was not allowed to travel could be fined.
By doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
But according to the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of tens of thousands of fines.
He said that a driver's license is a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like with an identity card that it must be valid without exception.
Those who no longer wish to drive should return their driving licence.
You can simply bring it or send it to the municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also required to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Those with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to renew.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court has reduced the sentences of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych's gang, will each serve 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague High Court thus sentenced them to a final sentence of one and two years respectively.
Initially, detectives in the Organized Crime Department faced sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment given today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already received sentences of more than 16 years in prison in other trials.
He can't get more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found 19 people guilty of holding ups, and the High Court was now hearing the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the accusation, saying that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, following an agreement with Berdych, among others, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered up the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang was paying off 30 percent of the theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment covers the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
The main reasons for this are armed robberies, in which the victims have, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of power by a public official and the prohibited use of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, shells with a steel core, a laser target or a machine gun.
The allegations suggest that the gang has made tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from the nearly 20 men involved in the case, the courts have already convicted Berdych and a host of others of other robberies.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still in the process of appearing in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has for the time being avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are currently detained in Ireland, where they are awaiting final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The cost of substituting children: 12 million
The lawyer for the disaster victims, Igor Veleba, wants to obtain compensation of 12 million crowns from the Třebíč hospital plus expenses.
Three million for each mother, two million for the father and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, it is very, very high", Dostál said at the hearing.
'In order to be able to reach an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party has ordered to be written.
We'll see if this has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands", Dostál stressed.
The amount should be between Kč 100 000 and Kč 200 000 for each of the four parents, he said.
At the beginning of the case, Jablonov's family demanded a million crowns for each month she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress on varying scales and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by men, although they were faced with regrets that they could not prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, are less at ease with the trauma in the news and with what is happening right now, the Veleba report summarized.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák family in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil awarded each family 100,000 crowns at the end of October to reimburse the costs incurred by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital run by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have liability insurance.
In the event of failure, they must draw from the reserve, exceptionally they may ask the manager for help.
So far, the courts have recognized relatively small compensation, the amounts calculated on the tables being in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost the Valašské Království (Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolekívka lost the dispute over the Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko) trademark.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he was the first to use the title of King of Valašsko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the actor's former collaborator.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
But according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Polívka", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
He said the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone this actor and comedian.
Harabiš agrees with me.
"There's a job behind us that's been going on for almost ten years.
It's about finding money and setting events up", he said.
He thinks money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They want to parasitize our work", he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, Polívka used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in her television show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
But at the time, this had nothing to do with the plan to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing passports for the Valašské Království.
From a humorous action to a lucrative business and commercial activity, Harabiš created the Valašské království company.
In 1997 Polívka accepted his name and signature to be mentioned in the passport and even offered the holders of the balance on the price of visiting his farm and his theater shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the nude idea, published by Polívka in the manéž show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project", the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who were intensely dedicated to the project.
The collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organised an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to build up between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I forever elected".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under Harabiš' inspiration, taken over by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, demanding that the court reject it today.
What could clear up the matter is the planned tournament for the throne and half of the princess.
There should be a new king out of it.
He didn't want to give out the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to rush into business.
It would be something like the King's Parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course sign up", Harabiš added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: the end of prejudice
To be honest, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling characteristics were not unusual, and the quality of the change of speed, of the handling and also of the manufacture could in many respects be considered to be below average.
The current market is dominated by the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
Especially since the SW combi goes one step further, I just have to think it over.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback I complained about, for example, the head space in the back seats.
While there is no complaining because the combined body means that even the great demons will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's see what happens.
I'll talk about the inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, and my only comment is on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
I would have liked a more inventive design, given the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days when you could complain about seats or too short files are over.
The lateral guidance was also significantly improved compared to the Model 206.
As for space, the increase in body size is also noticeable here.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head mentioned disappear.
A box in the box
So the most important thing about this vehicle is its trunk.
I have to assess this as very accessible (also thanks to the rotating back ice) and rather easy to arrange.
Blind spaces are fitted with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not overwhelming and can be stretched while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's just stick to the volume.
The figures in the table show that the basic configuration is 428 l, which is a rather average figure compared to competition.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle of this category in the Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW to the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, it is clear that the Peugeot is very much behind, with a difference of 52 litres.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But if I were to point out the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the trunk left after the rear seat folders were flipped perfectly straight, or a very low pedestal.
120 horses on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 litres and a power output of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like when it comes to running a family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's not eating much, and most importantly, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pitch clogged by a sprinkler, then I can only be excited about it.
Looking at the prices
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, one must be aware that we have tested a car that is quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a 1.4 litre Otto engine at 329 900 Kč is still affordable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The premium equipment, which has also been tested, raises the price by Kč 80,000.
We also have airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic window wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531,900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try adding the extra equipment to the Fabia price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So all we have to do is choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is failing
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which raises concerns among the remaining population about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of indigenous people turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where conflicts between Slovak immigrants and Slovak residents are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The quarrels, the quarrels and the quarrels between the students have translated into the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was beating a ten-year-old student with a iron rod.
The defendant claims that the boy insulted her with racist words.
Police also had to intervene after two teenage girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly had racially remarked on the man and had stoned him.
"As we were walking home, a young man climbed onto the bus stop and began spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he uncovered his ass", another unpleasant adventure was described by a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between indigenous and immigrant residents is beginning to be tense.
70 000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can come true if you make the right choice.
Gold and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palm trees and everything with waiters offering you a pizza, ice cream or a cocktail on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find this list not only in full but also in rich form.
But there is only one island where you will find much more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
In the days of the Spanish, Cuba had been the stronghold of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the depository and transshipment point of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was allowed and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, and all that.
In Havana, tall buildings have been built and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950's, have been circulating on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he owned his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America were leaving their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you can enjoy the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still run in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats that were once imported have long since, in such a salty and wet climate, become rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is considerably decayed, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money when needed, its development is in the green light.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had been returned from the extensive sugar plantations on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been updated for decades, and so you can see small locomotives running on them, whose contemporary locomotives are not found elsewhere except in museums.
Where to direct his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in the property of Hemingway, mentioned earlier, there is a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
A lush vegetation grows on a limestone soil.
Candlelight, limestone balloons, and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has seized their guts, and even its rotten rocks are covered with a dense vegetation mat.
The valley is probably where the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone might find it equally interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was filmed.
The following is a list of the countries of the European Union:
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty and the showcase of this small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, which was later developed by the French, was almost completely destroyed.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that until the 1950's there was no road connecting the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
They were not building anything, so they were not demolishing anything, but they were just having a roof over their heads.
If Trinidad has more than one afternoon, then it is also worth visiting interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is lit up after sunset and where the music is only heard early in the morning.
Other
Some call this village in the far east of Cuba the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path leading there.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo have to cross high, rugged mountains and through a landscape almost without signs of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the eastern part of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
It is the best chocolate made in the world, the church has the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after Columbus's voyage) and from the hill where the former fortress and the present El Castillo Hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba, Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of former slaves, all these could be filled with a number of pages.
But, as they say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, the Americans say
The lack of troops and equipment is affecting the operation in Afghanistan, the United States says.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
Alongside the growing protest from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week called for more action on NATO troops through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Britain has prioritized strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and increasing development aid.
"The developments in Afghanistan are noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves", British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to US military data, the most intense in the last five years.
Violence increased by 27 percent from last year to 60 percent in Helmand province, in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, including nearly a quarter in the southern part.
The United States says the Allies have reached their absolute limits in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the coming period, as well as ways to achieve them", said Gates.
The NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The last few months have also seen conflicts between countries over whether all allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as strict as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate", said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan sloths discovered: Germans playing, while ours fighting", wrote Sun in a document supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild counterattacked by posting a photo of a British squad during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The government debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding CHK 84,000 is on each Czech.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
The government's budgetary adjustment has reduced the budget to 152.8 billion crowns.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
But from June onwards, it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the government debt as of early October.
The amount of the debt exceeding RON 84,000 is the responsibility of each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has borrowed more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that, with a smaller deficit expected for next year, the one trillion crown deficit could be exceeded only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and 1 trillion crowns", said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor predicted similarly: "We could surpass the trillion by the end of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget which is not yet known.
If the political situation appears to be changing, and policies are ready to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I do not expect this change", he said.
Debt Growing
The state debt is formed by central government debts and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The State's debt is financed by bonds, bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The national debt has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The State's external debt has increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached KK 803.3 billion at the end of September and from June it decreased by KK 13.7 billion.
The average debt liability of the State has been 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased year on year by 13 per cent from the first to the third half of the year, which is far too high given the current sound economic situation.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly driven by the rate of interest rates, which are 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be negotiable when pension reform comes", commented Pikora.
Better than we expected
It follows from the 2007 State debt financing and management strategy that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, the Ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns, thanks to a better-than-expected change in the state budget savings.
The amount is mainly the deficit in the State budget which will obviously reach CK76 billion this year, instead of the CK91.3 billion originally planned.
The maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency are CZK 13.3 billion, the reserve of CZK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state-owned debt securities for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of the loans of the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
She was on trial today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-olds name a teddy bear Muhammad when any depiction of the Islamic prophet is illegal.
She was punishable by a fine of whipping.
The 54-year-old British teacher from Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition under Section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her six- and seven-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear in the classroom.
Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, says the school's principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the legend My name is Mohamed.
The bear itself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that the representation of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never do anything that would be insulting to a religious faith, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, he said it was just an innocent mistake.
The opinion was shared by many of the teacher's students who described her as being very attentive to her students and never speaking about religion in class.
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most common name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name is often chosen by Muslim families as a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules for using that name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
It is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They failed to reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded a sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach agreement on the status, European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was at stake, his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to maintain peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
We do not expect violence immediately but we are entering a very difficult period, he added, noting that there are obvious tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their final visit to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian, could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last round of negotiations since the troika was given a new mandate by the UN in August.
The United States and Europe are expecting their mediation to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo by the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution, said Bosan-Kharchenko.
The declaration of independence unilaterally?
After eight years of UN administration, the West believes that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in her favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
Unfortunately, no agreement was reached, the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the Baden Hotel where these last-ditch talks had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade was a past that led to murder and deportation.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was always possible, warning the majority of Kosovo's Albanians against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about a domino effect in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that compromise is impossible.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the final say
Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: at the Security Council.
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be made in consultation with the West.
Bush pulls out an Israeli-Palestinian agreement
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he convened in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the "roadmap" for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, chaired by Abbas, would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including the central issues".
This designation covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and thorough" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
In his turn, Olmert pledged to ensure that the forthcoming talks are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them by the course of 2008".
Bush set a deadline for the implementation of his "two-state vision" of coexisting Palestinian and Israeli states at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was the originator of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saud said in an interview with the Arabic-speaking daily in Saudi Arabia.
The prosecutor's office says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As with every time in this type of fact, official versions and rumors contradict each other.
What were the circumstances of the accident?
According to the preliminary evidence from the National Police Inspection General (IGPN) investigation, a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
She was not on duty but on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophore, a police source explains.
A green Kawazaki-branded motorcycle, not approved, therefore not allowed on public roads, driven by two young people without helmets, was travelling at very high speed.
She hit the police car on her left, after a right-handed refusal to give priority, a police officer said.
Blood alcohol controls on the occupants of the vehicle were negative.
The condition of the car (front of the car, windshield with stars, bumper removed) is evidence of the violence of the shock.
Very soon yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontus, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation into the incidents of involuntary manslaughter and non-assistance to anyone in danger to the IGPN, in consultation with the departmental public safety department of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation at this stage excluded the police from responsibility.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the police's version, namely that the mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footstools on the floor, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly spread in Villiers-le-Bel that the police would have left the scene very soon, thus not providing the two young people with help.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out any serious error in this regard.
This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, and one that needs to be very careful, a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness of those moments following the accident.
One of his windows looking exactly at the stage.
"We went down immediately with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them", the witness said.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a policeman who was completely lame.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the youngsters, the fourth was talking on the phone.
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They also did heart massages, but to no avail.
I will not say that the police services have not provided assistance to the young people.
These young people were rescued.
The fire department came right away.
All efforts were made to save them, the prosecutor said.
Tensions in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first protests since General Musharraf imposed the state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting the emergency measures were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter retaliated by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police have charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other protests were reportedly held in Multan (central) and Peshawar (northwest).
The law movement on Monday gathered support from the religious parties in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president 'exhorted the people to send flowers to judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency and garbage to those who have taken oaths before Musharraf.'
'Musharraf's Promise is No Longer True'
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced Saturday night.
It was to be decided in the coming days on the legality of the presidential re-election on 6 October, by indirect vote of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
'Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court,' the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president 'no longer holds' after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was assigned to residence by his deputy chief of army staff.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Population Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile pill still have a failure rate of 5 to 6 percent, according to the Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed for better control of fertility, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has fallen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
And eight out of every ten births would be well planned today.
Or, for one couple out of every five, it's a monthly count, and if possible, it's springtime, which is considered the most pleasant time to have a baby.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of space work to complete the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, how quickly it was imagined, tools used by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical unit that was soon to house European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of pointing dock for the lab modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a 17.5 tonne solar panel power module already present on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the solar panels of the module, which are 76 meters wide.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged by a cable that stuck about a meter away.
The deployment was stopped so as not to damage the panel further.
The astronauts, who were originally to perform a control exit on the Discovery shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel with a faulty rotation system, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to go scooting the 30 meter long remote control arm of the shuttle added to the station arm to perform the repair.
He's one of the best spacewalkers at NASA.
He's tall, tough, very smart, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained physician was therefore tasked with operating on the injured solar panel.
After inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty cable and installed some kind of -tails  on the damaged area.
He was aided by a second spacewalker who remained near the S.A.S. and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulation to prevent electrical shock to the solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and braided by the astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS securities listed on the stock exchange
EADS is currently in sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aviation and defence group announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to deal with the delays in the A400M.
EADS is currently losing 4% at EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating result forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost of the delay in delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is 'between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, including more than €1 billion for Airbus'", said the European manufacturer EADS's parent company.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established the financial statements of the EADS.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS's operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the burdens of the delays in another programme, the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the ballot box: Russians will vote massively for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming their desire for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a televised message to voters on public channels, already recorded but with content kept secret.
He is doing so as head of the list of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president made no such point in receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
 We know the price of true democracy and we want elections that are fair, transparent and open, elections that are free of hunger , he added.
The opposition is far from counting.
She's denouncing a campaign that's been plagued with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganow says there have never been such dirty elections, even under Yeltsin.
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
 The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus 
The two most obvious questions lie behind these unexpected legislative proposals:
- Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
 The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel in control of their destiny , says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada Centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society in this Christian country fell behind five centuries after Europe; the well-known community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s,  Putin re-emerged with the model of a paternalistic state, which was perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror but by some economic ease, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians are willingly renouncing the personal responsibility they had briefly shown after the breakup of the USSR.
What is there to think about?
This is a phenomenon affecting all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
The conclusion of 54-year-old professor Tamara Tcherednitchenko:  What is it worth thinking about?
Those in power aren't too bad, why change them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives at Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are now open to the public.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on a 27 km line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far available only for humanitarian purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his rightful owners.
The eleven governments - Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all the States has been completed, and the opening-up has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research  to be carried out, including on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced labour , says Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the public disclosure of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or forced labourers and, if necessary, to provide proof of their internment, in order to make way for compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 full-time employees handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some scientists, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
 There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents , said in 2006 Prof Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin.
EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between India and Europe is already close to 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's leading trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's leading trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its leading foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly dop both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe is the first or second market for each of India's top ten exports, the European Commissioner said.The Asian and European giants trade annually for '€47 billion in goods' and '€10 billion in services', said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has 'not yet reached its potential'.

The Bank of England is aware of the concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about alleviating the current return of concerns about credit conditions and announced a £10 billion offer at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual offer.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its reserves during the expected maintenance period starting on 6 December as a five-week open market operation", it said in a statement.
The bank said 10 billion pounds ($14 billion) would be put on the market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT at the base rate and until 10 January.
It seems that this is the first time the BoE has put five-week liquidity on the open market.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it was "ready to take further measures to maintain rates" of interbank loans on a daily basis in line with its base rate.
The interbank rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England's marketed funds had been subject to a high penalty rate which had deterred banks from using it.
According to some rumours, supported by the change in the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC reject the consideration of PS's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and the New Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was included in a socialist "niche" (a parliamentary group meeting), outlined about a dozen measures adopted by the PS national office on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the rental framework.
UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), and the session was called off following the general discussion which resulted in a sometimes lively majority-to-majority exchange and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill to be considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming
Following many rumors about C3 Presents creating a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announced the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
For our company, it is an honor to work with someone who has, more or less, inspired the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 is producing the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10, at a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Republic Festival director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the reader's board of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now can accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the most inspiring event he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as our marketplace and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have become involved in political intrigue because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
Thankfully, we've been able to talk to Melvin Benn and we're preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after making a name for itself in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, whereas ours takes place in urban green spaces, says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to combine the two formulas in one way or another to give a feeling of both a European and an American urban festival.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the event, says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life.
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is very large, like the 80,000-capacity Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were issued to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed at the time of the press release.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators", says Charlie Jones.
His partners in C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie theaters to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A politically difficult mandate because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the runway productions.
Is it hard to play in the legs of the Governor?
 Be careful, the industry decides where it goes.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are good, she'll go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge to be the best, he said.
The Race to the Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote cinema here.
The Oscars race is on.
All the festivals on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about showing Quebec films, highlighting them and making sure the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a great showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It's going to be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is showing in Santa Monica and will be shown at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a stock market rally at the end of the year?
Less than five weeks into the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in the hope of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market is generally positive.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, since, in the current context, uncertainties are looming in the markets, at least in the short term.'
Although they are not in favour of a boost in the stock market during the last weeks of the year, the experts note that "the stock market is fuelled by liquidity, willing to invest in the absence of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leakage to high quality values in both the long and short term".
In this respect, they believe that the stock market will behave rather sideways, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is unknown, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, BPI's head of sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing", the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index, the Ibex, has lost almost 4 percent since November 8, when it closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance is that things will be a little different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution Day (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we are close to technical levels and "this is why we could see a rebound in the index that could be caused by information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the credit crisis".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to select the values that will be responsible for driving Ibex to new maximum cuts.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the big values are back for him".
The expert said the portfolio included the two major banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date is approaching, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
In the meantime, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco says that the increase will be due to the banking and industrial sectors.
The rally will also be open to women builders if they participate.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path", explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the main factor in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do just as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month only on two occasions.
The real end-of-year rally took place in 2003, a year in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 has recovered 28.17%, the month of December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the time being the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will be successful in computer-based rallying at the end of the year.
The People's Bank will open 200 offices open at 12 noon Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renovate much of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
The rest of the Spanish agencies, too, have decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 8:30 p.m. and to open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has repeatedly said that it would like to expand its branch schedules, BBVA, although it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He's about to make a deal with the unions to close 75 percent of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for other bodies to join or not this initiative which coincides with the business hours.
This is precisely the objective pursued by the People's Bank.
To attract self-employed customers who move to these areas to shop in the SMEs and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new agencies but about renovating existing ones.
The organisation will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedule is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more up-to-date design with brighter colors.
The bank's commercial manager, Ángel Rivera, says that this renovation does not involve large investments but rather the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others operate under the brand of Mundocredit, which specializes in immigrant cases, also with very extensive hours, which are open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our customers", says Rivero.
So far, they've reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with outside staff at the bank.
Telecinco for the first time double the market value of its rival Antena 3
We got it.
This is the expression of Paolo Vasile, a delegate adviser to Telecinco, who expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the close of the stock market when he found that the channel he runs was twice the value of its rival, Antena 3.
One aspect of his joy was that 'what hurts me is not that we have increased more but that we have decreased less,' he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, we 'have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54 percent increase.
That gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66 percent a year ago.
The company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (an increase of 13%) is now valued at EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which sold 1.52% yesterday and has been down 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other publicly traded communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
Vasile said the comparison with Antenna 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues this year, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the deputy adviser of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising subsidiary.
For the announcement to be true, the TV channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in its advertising turnover for the current financial year compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
Net revenue of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net revenues of television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the annalists point out for the relative improvement of Telecinco's stock exchange is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is too early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol and in combination with Mediaset.
'We have a formal commitment to give at least 50 percent, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we can satisfy our shareholders, who we have already given securities with the 33 percent of Endemol'.
Analysts say the market is showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5 to 5.1% in 2009.
This same company reduced the forecast of Antenna's gains from 3 to 4,5 per cent in 2008 and to 7,5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1. the Commission
Ibersecurities recommends buying both securities based mainly on its high dividend yield and long-term sustainability potential.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
The Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulating) as better than Antenna 3 (maintenance) for the 'multiple attractions' and the rise in business.
3. The Commission
JPMorgan: It recommends that both cases be considered because it has had 'similar threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
The Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
Alongside its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress on the amendments to the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of it coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to guarantee investor protection and to regulate the activities of bodies in detail for markets to function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, enhancing the powers of the heads of the National Securities Market Commission (NVC) and promoting cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialised social and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FAs), which will merge securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
It also increases the number of systems for executing transactions on financial instruments, so that multilateral trading and order internationalization systems can be added to regulated secondary markets, which are in competition with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services firms to disclose to the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a register of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
Several amendments have been added through the Congressional Budget Committee, one of which highlights that debt held will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, as has been demonstrated by what has happened with the US subprime mortgage debt.
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management has taken advantage of to legally limit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977 was approved, the Royal Decree that limits the professional functions reserved for economists.
The Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, which does not require the authorisation of the CNMV and which can provide its services of marketing products and attracting new clients to different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices increases by five tenths in November to 4.1%.
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a snapshot of the price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as the one used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data to be revealed on 14 December.
'IPC will continue at relatively high levels'
Second Vice-President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November was a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes stated in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%", the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to raise 42 billion euros over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50 per cent to £12,000 million since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time he had amassed a record few deposits of over £25,000 million, a figure that has been gradually dropping in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee that the government has offered and will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would name the organisation with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the UK banks' income that will be deposited in the next three years to get those 18 billion pounds left over until the 30,000 million target is reached.
The wealthy Richard Branson group, known for its blatant advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the offer from the Virgin Association, which has three other companies participating, including its favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana has been arrested for allegedly plotting urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) early this morning because of his alleged connection to the urban corruption plot uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the city council secretaries and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current right-wing MP and until then the city councillor, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by SER, could be the 'leader' of this plot.
Officers are continuing to search the town hall and the town hall and there is no denying that there will be further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the prime suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As the SER Channel reported yesterday to the lawyer of the 'people's party' member Juan Morales, he was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
Moreover, according to the sources of the investigation, the investigation is concerned with the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's bid for Toledo and to chair the Congress if they win the election
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer from the President of the Government and the Socialist Secretary General, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's list for Toledo for the next general election and to be President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general election.
The organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting with Zapatero at the party's federal headquarters this afternoon.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also stressed that "yes it seems" that the Manche politician will be the candidate of the Socialist group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono will replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, which on November 15 announced its decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon its political career to focus on combating climate change in academia.
The former minister acknowledged that the head of the Government has been pressing for his return to the political front since he left two years ago.
He also noted that while citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will be the president of the Congress in an "act of transparency".
If he gets to the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insults or screams" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times".
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín, and "his skill at doing" and he did not want to pretend he was already in office so as not to fall, as he noted, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
A climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to relentless persecution of both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it must demonstrate a consistent iron grip.
This is especially true of a leader of the movement who is the head of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a new contract for the planet.
This approach requires him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leadership of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-enforcement, in what sectors it occurred and why his government, the one of the contract with the planet, did not prevent it.
He must also explain to the Spanish people clearly what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced upon us, what economic consequences will this have.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and pay to save the planet.
But there has been no explanation and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even a hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he was quick to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of no real consequence.
With phrases that have an impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who doesn't speak, doesn't denounce and doesn't demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is only a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we are cycling or cooling off with the range.
The mayor and the head of the Totana Police Department arrested for allegedly plotting urban corruption
Spanish police arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the town's secretary and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, sources in the investigation said today.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where many officers were present at the time, who also presented themselves to the City Council Office for Urban Planning and the municipal Land and Housing Management Company.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid in an operation to redevelop more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land for urbanisation so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after paying illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which Totana Court No 1 is investigating.
The first six inmates have been sent to a courtroom today.
According to the sources, the former city councillor of Totana and currently an autonomous MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the target of the investigation.
In addition, the former wife, who is the owner of a registered real estate agency in Totana, was charged, as was the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. of Vigo (Galicia), was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), along with Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, the Nuaria Group's agency, through which the bribes were allegedly carried out.
The investigation is being carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in firms linked to detainees located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was therefore arrested in Totana, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the area, who may have been the intermediary.
Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of reclassified land in Totana and its project is expected to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo's parking lots in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things That Happen
1. the Commission
If they like, we'll leave the Book of the Month alone, see if we can think of any other ideas during that time.
I'm already thinking of something.
Life is change.
Of course, you're welcome to propose inventions.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (which is certainly in the PISA news headline above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that, curiously, Blackburn's book review appeared there:
"The content of the Philosophy course challenged public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit, a bachelor's student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Education Counselor in Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that professors adopt a critical attitude toward Plato over what was written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he asserted that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic philosophy course in high schools".
3. The Commission
A colleague is passing information on the introduction of criminal offences into the Penal Code through internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by a sentence of six months to one year.
Theft from a CD shop for less than EUR 400 is, however, only considered a crime (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than the penalty for downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty for downloading it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to engage in a fight than to engage in the trafficking of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight would carry a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and trafficking in CDs would carry a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to Article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real world then someone is exaggerating.
Four.
My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money activates the brain, especially when others receive less.'
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using MRI scans at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the neurocognitive imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, "the most intense activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and the partner failed".
The researchers observed that when both people suspected they were getting the same salary, the activation was moderate, but if one of them was getting twice as much, the activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been pursuing war criminals in the Balkans for eight years, working tirelessly in the public ministry of the former Yugoslavia Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on this list, which is the subject of the Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach's documentary, 'Carla's List' (2006, not shown exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade, New York, who pursues runaway criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of an accident, involves a significant expense which will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
The fact is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of vehicle.
And it's that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is made through an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, age of the driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the premium to pay.
This is why people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower accident rate than they should.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
Increasing the frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
The driver must therefore carefully consider the situation in order to choose the best car insurance for his or her profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the insurer's characteristics, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 have to face various disadvantages when entering into a contract with an insurance at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and old driving licence.
Although the ideal insurance is a high-risk insurance, there are other, more economical options.
The most prudent drivers can opt for risk-free insurance so that they can get the coverage of risk-free insurance at a more affordable price.
This type of agreement involves the customer paying part of the amount of the loss.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined by the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", says Luis Noguera, the manager in Spain of First Europa, online insurance intermediary.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer provides protection for damage caused to third parties, but by those caused to his own car.
It would also be protected from theft, fire, and vehicle loss.
I'll give you some advice.
If you are under 25, try to be cautious and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the premium, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic fare.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses", explains Noguera.
Over 25 years of age makes it easier for drivers to sign an insurance contract, since the accumulated experience reduces the accident rate.
For this reason, it is best to choose a risk-free insurance policy with frankness.
"Usually young people cannot benefit from the prior experience gained after an accident", assures the European company's manager in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, after the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is best to negotiate a risk-free insurance policy, as long as his economic situation allows.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the ones with the lowest accident rates, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a non-discriminatory insurance policy (which can be up to EUR 300) or extended third party insurance from the third year of the vehicle's life when the insured person has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed way of driving and they have more purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchisees", says judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a risk-free insurance with a deduction is preferable (i.e. 150 euros) or an extended third-party insurance where the insurer has a high level of premium.
It is important to consider the insurance policy that is most appropriate for our individual circumstances.
Celtic will try to score a point in Milan to reach the eighth round of the final
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will play each other next Tuesday at the San Siro in search of the missing points to reach their respective goals in the Champions League closure, as it is for the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have a total of 10 points and they have already qualified on the fifth day with a draw against Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but they still need another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and receives Benfica who has four, does not pass them.
The two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan AC will play the semi-finals of the World Cup in Japan on 13 December in search of a place for the final on 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow know that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth round.
A defeat by Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but they cannot calculate that alone since with nine points the game goes to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
The Milanese will try to poison the evening with the Scots, who have high hopes of reaching the Champions League final for the second time after being beaten in the last edition by a goal from Kaka in extra time (1-0).
Until the Rossoneri win, the victory would only go to Shakhtar, in case Celtic lose, to qualify for the eighth round of the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a win.
20,000 people in Vancouver for the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls opened their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, before an estimated 20,000 spectators since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before their start at GM Place in Vancouver that the band's reunion was "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out tickets to the concert, which was the subject of a video that told the story of the band's fury in the late 1990's.
The reunion and world tour coincided with the release of a new album that re-launched their major hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI released in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took the stage showing off the bracelets that 'Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham, had given them.
The athlete was in the crowd that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he'll think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' who left the band in 1998 "because of differences between us" and caused the band to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings for Spice Girls changed.
And I thought, why not, I'm glad I made a decision", Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have worked out and we really like each other".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
First, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines flight.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
She had five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (on December 4) and Los Angeles (on December 5 and 7).
They will be on display in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is alarming.
A dispute over gas prices is heating up between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of impacts on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are carried by pipelines, and each pipeline is closely monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, a dispute between the two countries had caused a decline in supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Russia's gas-supply monopoly company Gazprom tried unsuccessfully to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as planned, given that it agreed to pay for 2008 up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would mean a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
 It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, reminding us that we are a country through which most of the gas passes, the Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
 The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine 
The last major clash between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 resulted in the disruption of Gazprom's supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, which led to higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas reserves, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Union nations in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must monitor its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Health Ministry should improve the checks it carries out on its extra-Community employees to check whether they have criminal records, the control committee said.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Health Ministry has no precise data on the number of overseas workers it employs.
The report nevertheless highlighted other crucial checks, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on extra-Community staff following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving his jeep into the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, suspected of being involved in various car bombing attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to ensure the validity of their qualifications, experience and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Service uses Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal background checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside the UK.
Among the many warnings, the auditor general's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Record Control, thus allowing employers to undertake controls on various countries.
 Although we have found that certain information about staff has been verified, this is not always the case.  The report states.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks it would itself, but he also added:  Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
It stated that 'the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value.'
The Scottish health authorities have reported 1161 overseas workers, mostly doctors and nurses, employed.
But the Auditor General stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems of identifying permanent contract staff who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation showed that the current procedures for health authorities' checks in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment checks for overseas health service staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport. 
She added that the Scottish Government allied with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report, which is due to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better enforcement of the recently updated pre-employment checks, which are valid for all employees, including overseas workers.
Joy Division is the winner of the Oscars.
Control, the biopic on Joy Division's latest singer Ian Curts, won five awards, including best picture, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was cast as Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Ms. Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to international attention.
The awards were handed out at the London Round House ceremony.
Control tells the story of Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, whose soundtrack was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of barely 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first for best director and the second for best debut director.
Le Rock was also awarded the Best Documentary award for Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mob boss in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his bold character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has directed films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of star Harris, the protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to access the cinema, he said.
I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.
I was admiring this great actor of today, I was extremely honored
The Independent Film Oscars, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Among the fans and bosses of Bifa are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it has arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells for an imminent attack on an oil field, as well as attacks on clergy and the armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smugglers cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
An eight-member cell led by a foreign resident was planning an attack on an oil refinery in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper reported.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a 35,000-strong military group to protect the sites following a failed Al Qaeda attack on the largest oil site in Abqaiq in 2006.
The newspaper cited a statement from the interior minister, saying 18 of the people arrested belonged to a cell led by a missile launching expert who infiltrated the country.
It's said that the militants were planning the counter-range of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 of the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergy and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against the Saudi-led Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the allied Shiite Muslim government in the United States, which is seen as heretical by the hardline Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergy have collaborated with the authorities to support the government-dominated policy of the royal family.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and power supply sites.
The armed forces have made considerable efforts in the last five months, the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized in a  media cell  aimed at promoting  takfiri thought , the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate on Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit has shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to previous belief.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation combined with slower rotation, has led Venus to a completely different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is without water, ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms, and has a surface temperature warm enough to melt lead.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford's Department of Physics, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We're beginning to understand why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth's, even though the planets themselves are pretty much the same.
 Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface. 
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would be worth $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he wasn't up to the task of running for president, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters recorded their questions and submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, the candidate for the next election.
It is not clear on what criteria the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, chose the YouTube clips to show to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-sided debate, focused on immigration.
This is one of the strongest issues for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The board saw an increase in approval when candidates spoke out in a rude way.
The most difficult and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr. Romney, who is leading the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodative about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
Both fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote  amnesia" (giving illegal immigrants regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, have been able to dig deeper into this topic.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they started fighting immigration before and more decisively than the others.
In general, the candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This, coupled with concerns about the toxic toys made in China, and other fears about the outside world, are encouraging the Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked if the candidates believed the Bible as a whole.
This led Giuliani to venture to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he was not sure he believed the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
We did not expect Mike Huckabee, who was elected in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism, to declare that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When the question was asked whether Jesus would be favored, he laughed and said that Jesus was too elegant to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to anything.
Mr. Huckabee's ascent to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious grants search led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistling in Wednesday's debate.
These two have emerged from the void, thanks to the fact that the two party proteges cannot agree on who is the most popular and traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly through a successful message about American greatness bringing leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The pains of the workers
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole to dive into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
The British scandal is not particularly juicy.
No decoration sold, no Paris hotel bills from politicians, no extra-marital toe sucked.
But here is a revelation that a wealthy businessman has for four years, under false names, hidden his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to over £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: Another battle that Gordon Brown would have won.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his election plan, foolishly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said, the terrifying Mr. Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble on the brink of bankruptcy, has shown a lack of guidance and poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for a change in the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals revolted among the Lords, protesting the reduction in military spending: they proclaimed that being Minister of Defence was for them a part-time job.
At present, suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams and Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and his former head of vigilance) has led to their resignation.
None of this means Mr. Brown is bound to head for the exit.
However, governments may reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for long, when he is at risk of being suspended: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers are doing the audit; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to dismiss Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to the decisions Mr Brown made when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party's funds  of cash for members of the House of Lords , voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the Tories think.
Like Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to implement Mr Brown's longstanding Stalinist tendencies for a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special person, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of the big political backers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr Watt, who said he was aware of Mr Abrahams' programmes, but did not know that they were illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the head of the fundraising committee who spoke about the questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made after he came to government in June.
So far the prime minister has done half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he failed to draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, to resort to a committee of inquiry on the matter composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been broken, it's up to the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr Brown has to do, such as find a permanent chairman for the Independent Standards of Public Life Committee, which has been without a leader for six months, and prepare a good reform on the finances of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr Brown.
But he should face some biased facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good lead in the election; it has two years to win back the electorate, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card fraud.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see the wings twirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of fees and insolvencies, which measure the non-recoverable or non-recoverable shares of the balance sheet more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken $1.4 billion in its consumer loans, partly because of weak cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
The costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody's, a tax agency, the third quarter's 3.89% insolvency rate is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in 2005 in the United States regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions worsened.
The industry also advertises fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt consumers have to pay.
The Commission has also taken a number of measures to ensure that the credit card sector is not affected by the financial crisis.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct contagious links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair housing loans have disappeared.
But credit card issuers pay more attention to cash flow than to the value of assets, and so the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily change the credibility of borrowers.
They could even benefit credit card issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the property costs less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority for repaying the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgage lenders and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of stocks.
 We're not going to wake up one morning and reevaluate all loans.  said Gary Perlin, the CEO of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a sharp decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market are leading America into recession, the industry will certainly face a dire future.
Watch out for the dorsal fins.
The British bankers have pleaded guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify about their role in a fraud committed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of conspiracy to commit fraud in 2000, allegedly committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to get rich despite their employees.
They should appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Justice Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC Group, became famous throughout Britain as a result of two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue in the investigation that began after the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of government investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the "Natwest Three", claim they came to Houston in 2000 to set up a fraud scenario with Fastow and his former right-hander, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the setup of many fraud scenarios, which helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated that its interest in the branch was zero, but in fact the three British banks already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought interest in the branch bank for £1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest on this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow allegedly falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the truth is that these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in a Texas prison.
The three Britons were released following a $1 million bail each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest national company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, and could no longer hide its billions in debt or even offer its junk speculation as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in market value loss and more than $2 billion in pension loss.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Charges against Lay of conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were dropped because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Not in Moscow. Not out of Moscow.
The cost of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But it's only a small change for some Russians.
 It can carry up to 18 passengers  said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
Although no one really needs that many seats as it is more of a family-owned aircraft or for the president of a company 
Mr. Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Show, a four-day consumer-incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
Outside Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to attract the interest of newly wealthy Russians for their variety of products, from acajou yachts to diamond-filled cars like 50 Cent's.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his booth.
 it's a nice car, but nothing like our product  he said.
 Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft after the United States 
 Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in the black gold, like Dallas 
 We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists  said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University 
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for a place in the Klondike.
This week, at another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to sell luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to Forbes' list of richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are Russian billionaires, who are worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study of personal wealth developments in the former Soviet Union by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
 There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, which is why we are all here  said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She was at the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, The Jewelry Group of Soho.
Women are all well-prepared and men are worth a fortune.
Walking through the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said Ms. Yumatova, who was holding her high-fashion dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers who are willing to queue in the closets to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum daggers, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund stuffed bears are on display.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
 the Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands  said Mr Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch porcelain factory stand in Delf, in front of a painting by Raimbrant on blue, handmade tiles.
 it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling 
Indeed, the sellers here said that Russians with old capital (which is too much by Russian standards) have already gone from glossy logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the fair.
Despite this, thousands of people - millionaires, millionaire emissaries, and tourists - visit the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, CEO of King Koil Beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton embroidered in gold thread.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager of A1 Motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car customization company, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars to Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive on such tyres  said Mr. Karapetian.
He's definitely gonna keep it in his garage with 30 or 40 vehicles already.
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the expression  Russian millionaire  is not on the agenda given the rising real estate prices here.
 if you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in kind  he said.
There's more than you might think.
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of the Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company has built four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire show.
People who are arrested for throwing lots of bills ask their friends to take pictures of them on their mobile phone amid this fake wealth or picking up a few million.
 you see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire , said Mr. Karyev.
Unapproved surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving Eve when Ronald Livingston was looking out of the window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and watching an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another one.
Then I saw the medical vehicle stop. Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities would later learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of her death was a gesture by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the cause of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confident that the results of toxicological tests will take time, but that should allow us to solve this mysterious death that has saddened the highest ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant to the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious, Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
She was like a pit bull.
 she would have done anything to protect me 
Mr. McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for the Union County Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
 This is a possibility to consider. 
 the investigation is ongoing. 
Authorities said they arrived at her house around 3:00 p.m.
And found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was pronounced dead.
A little over a week has passed since then, and the authorities have said little about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was interviewed by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's house where a faded rose tree rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barks in the back.
A blue can called  Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hanging from the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"You must be careful of this", she said.
She was there when I got here, and she was there when I left.
It was embarrassing.
Everyone hopes the Federal Reserve will lower rates linked to the global stock market boom.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, later lowering the interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the US central bank's vice president.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that decision makers must be flexible and pragmatic in their actions in the volatile financial markets.
In an apparent effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit tensions, Mr Kohn said that recent turbulence had in part reversed some improvements in market performance in late September and October.
If this severe turmoil were to continue, it would increase the likelihood of further rigid financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further interest rate declines could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed down Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was exacerbated by Bear Stearns' statement that it would lay off 650 people, or 4% of its staff, to cut costs to offset heavy losses due to losing real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13,289.40 while the largest index, the S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of UK companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6%, while the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the high demand for a monthly auction of classified funds by the European Central Bank, which cut loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to inject further funds into London financial markets, causing credit tensions, have caused monthly borrowing rates by the UK banks to grow at their highest level since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since 12 November.
England faces an appeal against the criticism of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number six batsman for England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more importantly in such a broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will decide?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the head coach of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make their decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the president and CEO of England, is starting to fill out the application forms to become a national selector, at least part-time.
The one who fails to win the No. 6 backstroke will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to destroy what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the bottom, sometimes more by lack of luck than by lack of ability.
It's not just cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgement remains subjective.
Is this the right time to bring Bopara out?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which one to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee  tubby ?; both, new executives with good qualifications, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
Figures are important in decisions, but they also matter in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye, at the same time he has to take the door and a batsman has to be lucky to hit the cricketer of one day.
But catching the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain of playing the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself fit and continued to train for service.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer more.
Whether it's Shah or Bopara playing at Asgiriya Stadium is just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every Test and did well in the first, with five goals and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the leading cricketer in the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double century against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
They both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start in the 88th Test innings at Bombay, 32 first-class centuries against six for Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah scored just ten runs in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord's, his home town of Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan was back in shape, claiming his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his obvious lust in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy.
He's not scared of anything on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently bounced on a 4x4 at a showcase for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He only got minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from afar, to ask him if he'd seen this?
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his fast pace allows him to do his best, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection?
I'd be more than willing to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean Shah shouldn't apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he's the one who's playing this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, sending those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping the city will return to normal.
Some returned to fight the militants who drove them away from home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people were transported to Damascus by convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned on their own.
 I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad  said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the papers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.
"They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shiite militia of the clergyman Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his men to leave for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that the US-backed militia had allowed Al Qaeda to flee the western capital, and invited him home.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad due to a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.
"That's why I'm coming home today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the growing calm in the capital since the arrival of American troops, and to the continued training of  groups of citizens involved  well armed and collaborating with the US military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decay of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three, expressed suspicion about the exile visas that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return home.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country because of the death squads.
 we had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq  said the Sunni pensioner.
I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.
The decline in violence can be explained in part by the fact that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There is a fear that a sudden influx of refugees may further increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, you're well trained.
The smallest federal state leads the way in vocational education and training, and even stands out for the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
In one area only, the Sarrois are in a similar deficit to the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarois, that we are not French" - that is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by its own decision, is displaying for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is ranked fifth in the Cologne Institute of Economics' training monitor.
Higher education institutions have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the option of completing their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Saarland also brings more than average number of children to higher education - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"The vocational training system is being used in the Saarland", says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain a degree in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In terms of population, the double curriculum panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
This is why the Saros Ministry of Education has forced higher education institutions to launch a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative testing throughout the state.
To help children start early, the last year of kindergarten is free of legal fees - a pattern that has since been copied by other states.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not improve as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And despite the Saros, foreign language skills are not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could earn points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in the high schools - even if the Saros are not French.
Chávez is setting the clocks.
In Venezuela, clocks will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will set the half-hour time in the South American country.
Chavez is becoming a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, clocks will be set within four and a half hours of Universal Time.
This gives the South American country a time zone that is unlike any other country in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position by, among other things, the fact that the United States would have imposed the world's time zones being separated at full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) that he would cease relations with neighboring Colombia over a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have any relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't, already only because of my dignity", said Chávez, who is urging a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe is said to have "cracked the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Chávez had criticised on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chavez is in the mouths of everyone.
A new cell phone ringing is making a big splash in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already been downloaded by over half a million people on the Internet.
It was delivered by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at the most recent Ibero-American summit was upset by the constant interrogations of left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, a real wage decline is forecast to threaten German workers this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the poor development of wages, the increase in Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomic and Conjunctival Research, to Bild.
New costs could also be incurred in the case of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned 3.3 percent reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency has no longer the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices have increased by 3.0 percent year over year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus resembles Earth more than previously thought: the European space probe Venus Express has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and windstorms at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning strikes on Venus.
The European probe Venus Express has now proved this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus is bursting at a height of about 35 miles [56 km] from the cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles in the scientific journal Nature.
According to the famous cypress theory, lightning would have produced life on Earth. The storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
"If life existed there, it must have been at a very early date in history", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be little life on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of Earth, but she remains a twin", said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit with such a different evolution is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was an important milestone in Venus research, as no more probes had been en route to explore the planet since the 1980s.
The researchers believe that the latest research results, now presented in several articles in Nature, not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with our neighboring planet Earth are more numerous than originally thought.
So, in addition to the windstorms already known at the north pole, the researchers found a cloud storm at the south pole, which is turning much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents in the earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics and Cosmic Physics.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet, called the evening or morning star, orbits the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, is hardly like Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth as carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr Köhler, demands an end to the party dispute over the Dalai Lama's admission to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and calls on the Grand Coalition to settle the dispute over the Dalai Lama's welcome.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler expressed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I respect differences between cultures", said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensible foreign policy balance, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against accusations that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional one-China policy.
"China knows that too", said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and was attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, of the CDU's "leading policy" in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery, there was a vicious irritation in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel reports, also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese government leader Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to accept the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official positions, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, gunfire, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
All must be done to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not spread through violence in the streets, the German Interior Minister demanded.
Burning barricades, breakers firing on police with hunting rifles: After the severe riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not form in our own homes and become violent.
We must take this seriously", he told the New Press in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid changes in social reality.
The Federal, State and local authorities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its early successes".
But it would be too early for an end to the warning.
Schäuble also points out that in the German suburbs there are no problems in terms of sociology or urban planning as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had been involved in serious street battles with police in the last nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings were burned.
The German government's greater integration efforts were demanded by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat stresses that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 who have immigrated would be above average.
The first thing that should be done is to provide more training space.
"We must give young people a perspective", insisted Kolat.
The President of the Turkish Communities added, however, that social control in families was more common in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
"But we must be careful", Colat urged.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of unemployment and the need to ensure that the young people are able to participate in work and training should be adopted.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything was very quiet during the night.
Police units were on the ground, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
Police said three arrests and burned cars and garbage cans.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the turmoil was overwhelming in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first evidence from the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the reign of Angela Merkel.
The Chancellor's utopian entry into the scene shows that the coalition is done with the bottom line - and that there is nothing to expect from her.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After its dismal intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which were chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be ruled by it.
The criticism of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It is provincial, she said, and only showed by this that she does not want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to all how accurate this reproach was.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a little feeling in the problems of the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, fleeing into foreign policy and even there staying in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it has repeatedly praised the Heiligendam agreements, but has not said how the climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even self-congratulation - having such little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now she's sticking to all the formulae that growth would affect people.
It destroys its image of pragmatism, which solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few extra sentences left for that.
In this respect, the number of times it makes lapses in the family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to say a half-precise sentence.
It's shaking in unknown territory, starting the moment it becomes concrete.
The Branch Attack
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tensions among candidates are already building on the first issue.
He would have made New York a "hideout for underground people", Mitt Romney blames his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He, for his part, countered with heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants", Giuliani replies, and reproaches the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates are on the rise: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have posted via YouTube are barely more than a breath of fresh air.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power", McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a strong lesson from Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the Iraq war and the torture debate is reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg City Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are rejected, applause is heard in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites once again reveal themselves.
"I made a mistake back then", says Romney contrit, apologizing to the base and the television audience for still being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is very confused when asked what he thinks about literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian form.
The day after he retired as army chief, Pakistani power man Musharraf was inaugurated as president.
Eight years of military rule thus ended.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was inaugurated on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus succumbed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless coup, the former general is now reigning for the first time as head of state.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had declared on November 3.
Shortly after his inauguration, Musharraf suspended the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thus fulfilling another Western requirement.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had held after the state of emergency was imposed with his lawyers, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The Krautrock fathers are back.
The German supergroups of the 1970s are playing again: the three Harmonia members took their console again at a concert in Berlin.
They returned with recordings of their big hit "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much more well known abroad.
The intended sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable, and most importantly, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sitting in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked on the left by 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, in front of the entire audience, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes it's inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
It does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, yes, the name resonates in pop's collective memory, but in no way so sustainable that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German have the right to celebrate its living legends of the 1970s?
Especially since what is mistakenly called "Krautrock" has always rained more in England and America than in its native country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the audience saw German pop faces questioning.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the pan-German praise, the surprise was beyond limit.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother would jump on the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in oneself and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and that during this period the impact power felt was much weaker than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the basements below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a church-subsidized label, for financial reasons.
Rother had worked briefly at Kraftwerk and eventually made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother accompanied Cluster's musicians into exile in the forests of the Weserbergland.
There, in a former Weser farmhouse, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as community members fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Commune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
It's more of an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
The garbage can was said to contain a harmonica Ottenstein chorus flagpole and also a name for art.
Many keep Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next was "De Luxe".
As quiet and low as the music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood was not his only self-search.
The newly released "Live 1974" CD was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record-breaking audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother issued at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this was an immoral requirement.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric realms and ensured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (Flaming Hearts).
Cluster came to life in the 1980s and has since achieved more success than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the live album by Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of preserving Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been excavated on this occasion as Roedelius' personal work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British punk former author of the book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the man who invented the Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be encircled with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's line floats through the room amidst the singular sounds: "The only true music is you listen to the future".
There are pictures showing the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photographs of bazaar wired tools serve to form the legend.
In front of them, the three veterans are busy improvising again.
But more by gluing microphones to the organ and drums, to make the instruments sound unheard of by the self-made effects instruments.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
The three of them are tech-savvy.
Even the choir of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the leakage of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is not now getting annoyed by it any more.
But what's most obvious will be covered thoroughly on stage.
Where does music begin and end?
This can be a shock to someone (?) or a momentary joy.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murder Peace", two films again deal with the Balkan War.
But neither of them convinces.
Either the projects are too much action and too much senseless exchange of fire, or they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is here, in the most grim backdrop of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many gentle, futile roles in women's sentimental films and too many Buddhist-themed press conferences made him want to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for watching "The Hunting Party" anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's films have to be as long and confusing as collective convention of locomotive drivers?)
He gives a beautiful, blinking picture: basically, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere might have become if the fate and film industry had not been so kind: a man who has had his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remnants of his former charm.
But despite this, "The Hunting Party" continues alongside the German production "Murder Peace", which also releases this week, the endless series of failed films about the Balkan War.
The film tells the story of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serb from Kosovo snipers, and one of the two quickly falls in love with him.
Although it is welcome that here Serbs are not once again presented as the sole cause of all evil, this flat-bottomed film is lost far too quickly in action and senseless exchange of fire.
It's still kind of a Cobra 11 Alarm without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party" why there was never a really good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track down the high-profile war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in small teams into the forest, to accomplish something the military can't do, and for both males, it becomes a journey of madness.
One of the reasons "The Hunting Party" failed is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the heartless, deserted cynic, as he was introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute him to a romantic affair with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, achieves what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a just vengeance against the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so bad that we should go to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for crimes against film logic.
In this case, the film has a human concern too deep.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects that the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) are not conducting the hunt intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But this time the good-intentioned and the bad-intentioned are so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He says of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumultuous heads, but that imply how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war films.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were huge flops.
We can add that there have never been good films about South Africa before.
That's always true: when a star hangs out on a crisis home or a minefield, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, it's always been decades before Hollywood can make a good Holocaust movie with "Schindler's List".
Some films still have to mature - those that today are worth classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" - were by no means universally celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But maybe we know too much about the conflicts of the world today, where every hecatomb comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that made the writers happy that they didn't have the scruples they needed to tell great stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Dictator" actually became so good too because Lubtisch and Chaplin didn't yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we should have the sarcastic, distant artistic look of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change".
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in horrifying ways and war will always reign in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust has been criticized for cancelling the Olympics.
The mayor's withdrawal from the Hamburg bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with fierce criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to keep fighting for the waterfront Games.
But von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chance.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a drop in the market on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has had as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures".
Mr Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the bill but to find a new, longerterm starting point, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday remained true to his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation", Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sporting Federation in early December, regarding the Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means that in the time frame we have foreseen until 2028 we will have no chance".
However, the dream is not definitely a thing of the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's comments.
This would give the impression that Hamburg will no longer be seeking to run for the Olympic Games within the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying projects already now", said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
The rejection of the nomination would be further contradicted by the statements made by the President of the Senate at the German Higher Education Association's plenary meeting.
There, Von Beust reportedly described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Hamburg Olympics.
The Federation of Higher Education Sports had in recent weeks first named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD faction of the mayor blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded housing construction", said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan for the Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU has reportedly relied exclusively on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have sparked a lot of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' boxes.
The one who connects the Swedish concept to the wooden box is thinking about IKEA, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast a shadow over Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the 80 "Type Stockholm" Brillo-Boxs listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, internal research at Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now led to a disappointing result: the six Brillo-Boxes, which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave to Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - as well as many of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate in the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York City, painted wooden boxes, which were based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet featured in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not on display at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak of about fifteen wooden boxes that would have gone down in history at the time as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes, with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of these have reached auction sales of over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and displayed in Sweden in 1968 and that Warhol would later sell them to him.
In fact, the 105 cases of Hultén were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined three other Swedish private collections, including two made in Stockholm in 1968: their layered panels were first printed and stamped, then applied with a white oil paint brush.
The texture of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly without a layer of background to the laminated panels, using a roll of paint - and it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", suggests Moderna Museet Director Lars Nittve: "Unless the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York makes another decision, Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material".
In July the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" raised in the case of the soap powder cases.
But since then, we've been in a constant silence.
The rebel soldiers in Manila are surrendering
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers are abandoning, the same soldiers who had stopped at a hotel in Manila and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer any bloodshed.
Loyalist soldiers had just stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been locked in the building for hours.
About half of them were brought to court on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly slip away with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were normally supposed to guard them, apparently had deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyalist forces surrounded the area around the respectable hotel.
The President has convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People are fed up", Trillanes said.
"We're calling on people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, who was the former commander of the elite Scout Rangers unit, said that other units of the army were about to join the march.
Critics of the regime called for a major protest against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila has been the scene of an attempted mutiny by about 200 army members against Arroyo since 2003.
The uprising broke down almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet has secured a 20 per cent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We've speculated about a ransom before.
The option to increase the participation in Versatel would remain open.
This step is aimed at accelerating the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, the market says.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch listed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", said a spokesman for United Internet.
Both companies founded the MSP joint venture to absorb competitor Freenet.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not to exercise their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
However, both companies would leave all options open, in particular to increase their participation in SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The still unpredictable poker on Freenet, which has been going on for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions at the end of the third quarter.
The holding company United Internet and Drillisch previously held a direct 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49% stake in Vatas had already been decided in August.
