Welsh Assembly Members are worried that it will look like the Muppets.
Some Assembly Members (AM) were baffled by the suggestion that they could in future be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans to rename the House of Lords the Welsh Parliament.
House members from across the political spectrum are concerned that they could become the subject of a message.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp means asshole.
A parliamentary representative from the Welsh party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative has stated that his group is "open" to a name change, but that the MWP in speech can quickly turn into the Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee currently preparing the law to introduce the name change has announced the following: Of course, the final decision on how parliamentary deputies will be titled will be up to them.
A 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals which found broad support for changing the name of the House to the Welsh Parliament.
As for how the MPs in the assembly would be called, the Committee preferred the term 'Members of the Welsh Parliament' or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
House members are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring headaches to House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill of amendments within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the House operates, including rules on the disqualification of House Members and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the bill, the members of the House of Representatives will have a decisive voice on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a centuries-old dispute with neighboring Greece, in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents an appropriation of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the initiation of its EU and NATO accession process.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, has said he will not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's have fallen as Harlem's churches struggle to survive.
"The elderly people I spoke to said that in the past, you could find a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
There is no one today.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly stay.
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the church leaders think and will sooner or later be returned to the beginning.
He added that the churches could replace the apartment buildings with apartments for people who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "so the day will come sooner when these churches are completely closed because the residents who move into these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that had been holding services nearby took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but as the parishioners of the Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they commissioned a set of bells, the so-called carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to the St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the poor man's bells".
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: cultural treasure and irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the world's first carillon played by a black musician named Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing the major carillon in a Riverside church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What's been going on at St. Martin's over the last few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish made up of laymen, wrote to the diocese in July over concerns that the diocese would "try to shift costs" to the sacristy, even though the sacristy was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the page of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's distress call, and then he and the group rode to the scene of the attack to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then he realized it was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone had been shattered.
"I've been telling myself to get everybody out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water,'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined to be a non-threatened species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablado to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and to ensure the safety of the beachgoers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's becomes a competitor to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department store-style beauty countertops and hiring specialist salespeople.
As part of a £2.8 billion UK beauty market expansion, which continues to grow alongside declining sales in the clothing and home furnishings market, larger cosmetic countertops will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in cosmetics is one way that supermarkets are trying to take advantage of the shelf space that was once reserved for televisions, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it will double the size of its cosmetics lineup to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique decorative cosmetics line, so most of the products will be vegan-friendly, which is what younger shoppers are increasingly asking for.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will trial concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second which opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the return to the everyday purchase of small amounts of food at local grocery stores means that supermarkets must work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fend off big-ticket stores like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos to hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted grocery sales and made those acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by a supermarket to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments had not been successful.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy followed Sainsbury's's sale of its pharmaceutical business in 281 stores to Celsi, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago for £125 million.
Claims Lloyds will have a role in the plan by putting a range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: 'We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We've also invested in a specialised team of colleagues who will be at the customer's side and give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive surroundings and accessible locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics, leading to a change in old shopping habits.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby walked away from a £11 million deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones left to "cry in anger" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his brand to focus on his new deals with the Marks & Spencer chain and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home furnishings and accessories brand Truly.
Their trademark has been compared to Goop's Gwyneth Paltrow trademark.
The host of This Morning (37) has announced on Instagram that she's leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones to cook with rage by pulling out of a mutually lucrative business at the last minute to focus on her own new glitzy contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the golden girl of television during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million mean she no longer has enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The deal was comparable to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune to an estimated £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of her vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to back out has stunned everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on a Tuesday so close to the launch of the entire line.
Marlow's headquarters is stocked with a lot of goods that are ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of dollars in losses because of large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible additional delays in the launch of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were for ten years close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined as chairman in March.
The couples are spending their holidays together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities".
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would get in the newspaper for comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and for having such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump made so many concessions?
said Trump, imitating the voice of a news anchor.
I didn't make any concessions.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not seen a "commensurate response" from the US to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead the US still had not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump, in his speech at the rally, took a much more optimistic stance.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
He threatened us with war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results - the halting of missile launches, the release of hostages and the return of the remaining American troops home.
He also defended his unconventional approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like the president, but instead of having 10,000 people waiting outside this packed arena for the entrance, we would have about 200 people there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomba is displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for using international aid resources.
Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear about not seeking international help, so it's all a bit problematic, Ms Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Pala, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Office, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to get involved in the relief efforts.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country is still woefully unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common in other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was in effect, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of weather, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is on its way to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure was the cornerstone of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the government under Joko is struggling with a lack of funds, and new elections are held the following year.
Joko is also facing the pressure of remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League match against Chelsea on Saturday with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal in the 1-0 win for Chelsea.
He passed the ball to his left foot before he kicked it into the opposing half.
The ball flew high over the goal towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally escaped Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and entered the net.
"It was demanding to get in that position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once, I didn't think too much about it and I just fired.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic during that game before turning somewhere in the middle of the field and crashing into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a fast pass to the center of the field.
Then he threw a beautiful pass that led Hazard to a goal.
Hazard went around the back and hit the ball into the net with his left foot on the opposite pitch to Liverpool goalkeeper Allison Becker.
Liverpool play a club competition game against Napoli in the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are set to host Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster management office announced early Sunday morning.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference that a large number of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of the building after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that was felt on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is littered with the ruins of buildings that collapsed.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hogan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would like to have everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead, and saw or heard anything suspicious, contact us".
I would also like to invite anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway, and police have stated that the process of informing the next of kin of the victim is underway.
A cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the officers told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now being told it will be several hours before they can return to their apartments.
A police officer allegedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman showed up at the crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans in the area, and another one was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers stood within the fenced-off area and monitored the block of flats.
Anyone with any information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, referring to the minutes 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to emerge amidst the debate over "rewrite history".
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupid" and "an attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmit, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become a subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not something that Cromwell ordered or implemented.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautifully rendered Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th century mind and a piece of historiography for a man many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament from outside pressure.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is the single most recognizable figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are still worthy of homage and commemoration.
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by his surname Yuan was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a stall at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, forensic examination confirmed that the 300-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
The Guiyang Evening News quoted a relative who goes by the name Wu as saying: My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market management are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, pig attacks on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor while his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate farmers in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "knocker".
They're just playing.
They're gnawing, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
They just need to show respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwestern United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes over the colder waters of northern Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rains to areas of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
At 0500 Eastern time, Rosa was blowing at 85 miles per hour, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure area is forming over the Pacific and moving towards the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern United States.
The rains will bring up to 250mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching low pressure area to cause heavy precipitation across much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause rainfall of approximately 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in some places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 millimeters of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Extreme flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the sparse nature of the tropical rain.
It is not advisable to go into the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rainfall could turn canyons into wild rivers, and downpours with thunderstorms will bring local gusty winds and a dust storm.
The approach of the low-pressure area will bring localized heavy rain to portions of the Southern California coast.
The road surface is a natural area, with a minimum of two paved surfaces.
It will be the first rainfall of the wet season in this region.
Scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday night and early Monday morning before covering a wider area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah state lines on Tuesday and continue all day Wednesday.
In October, large temperature swings are possible across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will continue to rise and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern United States are expected to be warm in early October with temperatures of 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 90 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast points to a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's six-nation television network's tense testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with reporters interrupting regular programming to announce a last-minute twist on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-sided investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, in a drunken stupor, had groped her and tried to strip her of her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh testified in a fiery deposition that he was absolutely certain it didn't happen.
Friday's hearing was probably watched by more than 20.4 million people, the number cited in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership numbers were not immediately available for other networks that carried the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring the number of people who watch content in the office.
To put it simply, this is a crowd that is similar in size to the one that watches the football playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership with an average of 5.69 million during the full day of the hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN was viewed by 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in the drama that played out on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught him being yelled at by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes downcast as he was booed by the protesters live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?
They told him, "You have the power while so many women are helpless".
Flake said his office had put out a statement before the elevator doors closed that he would say more at the board hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were watching live as the Judiciary Committee was to vote on referring Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the candidate within the next week, as Democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake was persuaded in part by his talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and then a few other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her Brexit plan of playing politics with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in a second interview in the same issue with her on the cover went on to criticise her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that the UK and EU should charge each other customs duties was "total nonsense".
The Wayde Sims murder: police have arrested Dython Simpson suspected of killing LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in custody on a charge of manslaughter, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video footage of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reported WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
Bail is set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "abstinence and the pursuit of truth".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6'2" winger grew up in Baton Rouge where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're always worried about", Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
The ash spewing from the Popocatapetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after intensified activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center has been tracking multiple humming and shaking.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have been noticing increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles southeast of the capital since a 2017 magnitude 7.1 quake shook central Mexico.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and after thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to mark Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists, who were intercepted by the riot police, began throwing eggs and paint powder at the police, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
Fights broke out later in the day when police used batons to quell the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", while unionists chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people have been admitted to hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local media reported.
Tensions in the region seeking independence have not abated a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal and which Catalan separatists celebrate.
A large majority of voters opted for independence, although turnout was low as those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop the holding of voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups spent Friday night in the streets to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations were held, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
"I watched my parents crying for the joy of being able to vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite winning a crucial, albeit narrow, victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties are having a tough time this year keeping momentum going as their most prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film demonstrations in support of the police, said that the clashes were fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
Candidating for the European elections is the best way we can make known the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government, he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car-ramming into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after driving their car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7:30pm BST at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the backyard door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point, a crossbow was fired at the car.
A shot from Mengi gave Livingstone a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston was the winner.
The new Scottish Premiership club Livingston have taken Rangers by surprise and forced Steven Gerrard to concede his second defeat in 18 games at Ibrox.
Dolly Meng's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team equalized Iberian in seconds.
Gerrard's side are still unbeaten away in the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play Hearts, the leading club in the league, trailing by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to suffer a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed his chance against the undead guests.
Holt's team should have been leading before they scored that goal, considering their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but it was too late on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only drive the ball wide after he slipped to intercept Craig Halkett's head shot to the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for the guests.
And that's exactly how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers missed a free-throw, and Livingston devised an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson both assisting Mengi, who hit the center of the goal.
Up until that point, the Rangers had control of the ball for the most part, but they faced an unassailable home defense, so goalie Liam Kelly was mostly out of a job.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs were intercepted by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow delivered a wide-field shot from another well-organized Livingstone attack.
The long-range passes failed to cross the goal line at Livingston, and two eleven-balls were not awarded after Halkett's clash with substitute Glen Middleton and one for handball.
♪ Great ♪ ♪ By livingston ♪ ♪ The analysis is ♪
Alasdar Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A great game and a great score by Livingston.
Each one of them was excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this entry path.
Their playing style and personnel have hardly changed since their return to the big clubs, but much of the credit goes to Holt and the way he's unified the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the head of a well-organized defense, and Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall from getting any respite throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standard they set by playing well under Gerrard.
They've only made a hole in the home team once and it's a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan greeted with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) all smiles were lit under the bright sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany... aimed at repairing relations between the NATO allies.
They differed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
It is the city with the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of the president's supporters appeared nearby to see him.
And hundreds of Erdogan's opponents - many of them Kurds - have raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The clashing demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor who is hailed by some Germans as a hero and attacked by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist fatally injured in collision with car
A cyclist was fatally injured in a car crash in London.
The crash happened near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist was fatally injured after crashing and fleeing the scene of an accident on Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash.
City police said officers are trying to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
The accident has closed roads and diverted bus traffic, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six police officers injured in riots
Prison officials say six police officers were injured in the riot at the men's prison.
Riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special Tornado units have been brought in to suppress riots involving eight inmates and are limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: Special trained prison staff have been engaged to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin prison.
Six members of the staff were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer time behind bars.
Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden ended up in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the SWAT team was called to the prison to resolve a serious situation involving a pool ball attack on the staff.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (possible benefit to dry areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but there's a chance that's exactly what will happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa passes with its remaining strength over the Desert Southwest and brings the threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a severe flood warning for Monday and Tuesday across an area from western Arizona, through southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should approach Phoenix late on Monday in the rain and cross it straight on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts 50 to 100 millimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 150 millimeters on the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the Rocks and the Great Basin are likely to have precipitation of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated totals of up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of torrential flooding, Rosa could come to the rescue as the region is suffering from drought.
Although flooding is a major hazard, some of these landslides could be beneficial because the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
"According to the U.S. Dry Land Map, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second-highest category", reports weather.com.
The path of the hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour and was located 300 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered the cooler waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
So it is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
The rains in parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to northwestern Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, with a possible maximum of 250 mm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main hazards expected from Rose or its remnants are very heavy rainfall in the Baja California Peninsula, northwest Sonora and the U.S. desert southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
At approximately 0400 BST on Saturday in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton an injured teenager was found.
He's been taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officials have asked anyone with a recording of the event to come forward.
Trump claims Kavanaugh has endured the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party during the nomination process".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual assault over decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the arraignment hearing on the charges she made.
The president said Saturday that on that day, the American people saw the brilliance, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service", he told supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republicans running for office mid-term.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I am, in fact, a candidate, he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere.
Trump claimed that the Democrats' mission was to "create resistance and obstruction".
A Republican leadership aide told CNN that the first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and the number keeps growing
Authorities said Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many by the huge waves that washed ashore as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high hit the shore at dusk, sweeping many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run and were injured", said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 500 miles per hour before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived", he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and businesses, crooked and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's tremendous earthquake was equivalent to twice the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It suggests that the city's geographical location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have increased the force of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroho, the number of casualties and damage may be higher along the coastline 200 miles north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications are completely down and we have no information from Donggal.
"More than 300,000 people live in the area", said a Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers were sent to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse", the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a barrage of criticism for not providing information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials claimed the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building, panic-stricken, warning people down the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a blackout that caused a communications blackout around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for humanitarian activities only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"While World Vision staff from Donggale successfully reached the city of Palu, where the staff were sheltered in tarpaulin tents set up in the backyard of their offices, they relayed scenes of destruction on the way", Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although relief groups have set in motion the wheels of disaster relief, some have argued that foreign aid workers with great expertise are being prevented from coming to Palau.
The Commission has also received comments from the Indonesian authorities regarding the use of the 'Region's' name in the 'Region's' and 'Region's' names.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says OK, it's a national disaster  we can receive international help, but such a state has not yet been declared. 
As the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis fell on Pala on Friday, friends and families of those still listed as missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate the dark scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Saturday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesia national paragliding team, was training two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
"Given the many years I've spent paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon recalled how, after news of the Roa Roa hotel demolition spread through the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palua who were participating in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a grey square instead of two blue squares.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during an ATM charge in downtown Newport on the Levee.
Thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee who filled an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement said the driver of the car emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with new money.
While he was busy with it, another man came running up behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was to be put into the ATM.
Witnesses have noted multiple suspects fleeing the scene of the robbery, but police have not disclosed the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In a Saturday tweet announcing the change, he wrote: "The living entity is officially known as Kanye West".
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes on the eve of his Saturday Night Live guest appearance, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
The show's creators said he replaced Ariana Grande, who was cancelled due to "emotional reasons".
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'", West said earlier this year in an interview with radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
So, I am you, I am we, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means "the one", to just Ye. It's a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, all of us.
The album itself is really a reflection of who we are.
He's one of a string of famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, JAY-Z, has been playing with versions of his name without the dash and with the dash and written in capital letters.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use the military against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against the students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday in the Plaza Tlatelolco promised that he would never use the army against the Mexican people.
Military units opened fire during peaceful demonstrations in that square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements began to spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly stipends to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it invests in AI research", said AI investor and AI expert Kai Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans for AI, even though the US lacks a formal strategy for AI in principle.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan to become the number one AI innovation country by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for the next big AI discovery", Lee said.
"Doubling the investment could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence will come to the United States", Lee said this week on CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Great Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that beat America's best Othello player, and later was the director of research at Microsoft and the president of Google's China business.
Lee praised previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
Lee says that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that's taking out academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been recruiting the brightest minds from universities to work on artificial intelligence research over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards", he said.
The Chinese State Council released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to individuals in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an AI committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of two billion dollars in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over 100 million US dollars a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the American legislature, which wanted to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Saturday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked the opening of negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
There is a province in Greece called Macedonia, and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the sovereignty of its territory, and it has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote has cast doubt on whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot paper was: "Are you for membership of NATO and the EU while accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the post-Yugoslav countries, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect it to be considered decisive.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that there were no irregularities reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
'I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe', said 62-year-old Gjos Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, in Strumice, on 30 September 2018, participated in a referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for joining the NATO alliance and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of the parliament in Skopje set up a small stage and received chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not as servants", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, a country with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
'I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after the vote.
He said that a positive result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will go to the referendum, which is below the required response.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support a referendum.
For the referendum to be successful, the exit must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would represent the first serious blow to the politics of a pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday, and led Manchester City to a 2-0 victory.
Aguero made the victory insanely simple, scoring a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the center of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through three of Brighton's defending players and then made his way onto the open pitch.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposing players in green jerseys.
He bypassed one of the defenders, then overtook a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he threw the ball to the left of Sterling.
The England striker from the first try returned the ball to Aguero who hit a right-handed kick into the right side of the net and beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot problems", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We planned to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the starting lead in the Premier League tie.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's court during that game.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left flank.
San pushed the ball a few times before he guided Sterling to the tripod.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net before it slid into the net.
Manchester City will take on Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to stop the Rockies from advancing.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was little reason to insist on a fresh start.
But the always competitive Scherzer is hoping for a win against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, make the playoffs.
The Rockies, with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, have at least secured a spot in the wild-card playoffs, but they're still hoping to win their first title.
Even if we're playing for nothing, we can at least throw knowing what the atmosphere is like here in Denver with the crowd, and the other team would be playing at the highest level I've witnessed this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
The Nationals have yet to announce their Sunday starter, but it's rumored that in that case, they're willing to offer Scherzer a chance to play.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, was warming up in the pitching room Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-hander from Washington has posted an 18-7 record this season, a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 innings.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The president, in his speech on the importance of Republican voters' turnout in the general election, commented vaguely on his selection of Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court Justice.
Everything we've done will be on the test in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones. I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates.
Trump continues: "Look at this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
Their intention is to take back power by any means; you see the evil, the corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to trample over to take power and control; that's why they want power and control.
The Democrats, as he puts it, have a mission to "resist and interfere".
"You've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, corrupt and lying".
He addressed Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you released the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the documentary. It was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer respects differences of opinion.
Does not tolerate the display of personal attitudes
I wasn't too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I'm the last in a long line of Labour MPs to be told they're not welcome - all because we said what we had in mind.
According to my congressional colleague, Joan Ryan, she was treated similarly for her strong opposition to anti-Semitism.
I was criticised in the censorship motion for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, similar issues on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I've been working as a local Labour Party councillor, the Friday night meetings of the main council have been like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are held in a different tone, and the promise of "more loving, more gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues who I thought shared similar political views began to demand that I drastically change my mind and take positions I would otherwise never have agreed with - whether it was about national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a barrage of insulting words on social media calling for my removal, renouncing the centre's policies and telling me that I shouldn't be a Labour Party member.
It's not just my experience.
I do know that I have had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that have been directed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily avalanche of sexist or racist comments, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me the most is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn last week said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every motion of no confidence or change of electoral rules we become a narrower party.
Many times in the last two years they have advised me to keep my head down, to keep my voice down, and they told me that it would be all right.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, spurred by the neglect of Margaret Thatcher's government which left my school's high-end classroom in tatters, I have wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most - either as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one at the Nottingham East branch could be misled as to my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I'd say to those who voted in favour of the motion on Friday is that, at a time when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will negatively affect households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But really, the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political gain will deter me from acting in the way that I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr  Melrose: 38:17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have had some impact on the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this highly exciting match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
Now they've reached the top of the charts and are the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, the superior defense and the better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said, "Thanks to Ayra, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did".
A goal from Grant Anderson in the 14th minute by Frazier Climo put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, who was sent off by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to improve the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unsuccessful attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by eleven points before, at halftime, he scored a goal and made a solo attempt to change the score to 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and a shot from Patrick Anderson, who executed Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
Then a long break occurred because of a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott who was carried away on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr continued his good game with a Stafford McDowall shot by Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again made the extra player pay, with a missed shot by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The winger was, however, back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for demolishing Clima who had no ball; with the line for a penalty, MacPherson performed the passing behind Ayra in a full-on penetration.
The Clima realize how he's done almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took a high-kicking shot from David Armstrong and sent out flanker Gregor Henry in the home team's fifth try.
The star of Still Game seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business.
Ford Kiernan, star of Still Game, seems poised to resume his service activities after it was revealed he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favourite sitcom, which he writes and stars alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to be shown, and it seems that Kiernan plans to dedicate it to life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun has hinted that Kiernan is looking to get involved in the "growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
"The Sea is Ours": Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, hopes the court will grant it an outlet to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are patrolling the busy shipping yard at La Paz.
The flag of the ocean is reported on public buildings.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are crying out: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to return it.
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost seacoast to Chile during the 19th-century resource wars is still alive  as is the longing to sail the Pacific again.
As Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's verdict expected on October 1 after five years of proceedings, these hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The crowds of Bolivians across the country will be watching the International Court of Justice's ruling on big screens and hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of arduous negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the ceding of a sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's ruling.
"We're hoping to bring back the Pacific Ocean", he promised by the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final hearings means the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have set them back.
"The issue of access to the sea is currently the focus of the Bolivian leadership", said Zárate.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has buried all goodwill in Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the dialogue, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed with the statement that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an unprecedented opportunity to begin a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  still one of the most favored presidents in Latin America  used the maritime issue as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to get over the past.
North Korea has said it will not disarm unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never disarm if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of these two rival countries in Singapore.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be keen to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, coming more than three months after his Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the sanctions were continued because of "empty imaginations" and that the US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will not bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to back the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's serious intention to give up the arsenal it likely sees as its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion magazines reveal that the latest line of large-scale headgear is on its way to the luxury department store in your neighborhood.
If you want to enhance your hat collection or completely shield yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the runway unveiled a line of fancy golem head coverings for their spring and summer 2019 collection and delighted style fans at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats, this summer, Instagram took over, and these designers have been putting their attention-grabbing creations on the runway.
The example that stood out was Valentino's large beige hat with a large feather-like border that completely took over the model's head.
Other great accessories included a decorated watermelon, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but these accessories were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One of the creations resembled a diving suit with a breathing tube and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow the great fashion saying  luck is on your side.
Stylists predict that the giant hoods may be coming to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly with the La Bomba, a straw hat with a circumference of about two feet wide that has been worn by many celebrities and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that swept social media onto the fashion runway has sent another big creation - the straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The bright orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia stripes and a white leather handkerchief, was a showpiece in Jacquemus' La Riviera's 2019 summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm expecting big hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer. Since the designer has made such a strong impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories".
John Edward: The language skills that citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, and is further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the careers they want to pursue and to become citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement the aforementioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the favourite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English alone to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results from this year's final exams show that the highest grades in languages were achieved by the students of the independent schools.
In total, 68% of the students who studied foreign languages received excellent marks.
Data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils received an excellent grade in Mandarin, while 72% of pupils learning German, 69% of pupils learning French and 63% of pupils learning Spanish also received the highest possible grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as electives are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of a workforce with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming imperative to prepare young people for careers.
With the increasing demand for language skills in jobs, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, those who have learned to speak a foreign language will feel the benefits of such a long-term skill in the future.
A person who speaks more than one language can communicate directly with foreigners, and this gives him an advantage over his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents, or 15%.
So investing in language learning is very important for kids today.
If children learn more languages, especially those spoken in developing economies, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will opt for languages that are considered to be the most important in the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scotland's independent schools provide an environment for children to learn, prepare and equip themselves with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
There is no denying that in today's global business environment, language skills are so important to the future of every country that they must be reflected in education.
So, knowing modern languages really should be seen as an 'international communication skill'.
Independent schools will continue to offer choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It's got to be done right.
John Edward is the headmaster of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron is gonna play his first Laker game Sunday in San Diego.
Fans are about to welcome the first appearance of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I really don't need pre-season games", he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off his campaign with a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned rallies Trump will hold next week, including brief visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for a new Supreme Court justice and plans to increase support for the upcoming election because there is a risk that Republicans will lose their majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time is tonight's rally in West Virginia starting, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse, pending a Senate confirmation vote for a week now until the FBI investigation is completed.
But the primary purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans gain a head start for the November election.
So Trump's campaign headquarters is reporting that five rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", reports Reuters.
"Congressional majorities are so important to the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter a turbulent campaign", an anonymous spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, reports the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the past month, the state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrissey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve his polling rank", political scientist Simon Haedar of West Virginia University told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA left their hearts on the field before Sunday's singles match
After three one-sided sessions, a Sunday afternoon couples' brawl may be just what was needed to turn the Ryder Cup around.
"Luck is the enemy of the good" is a saying that is especially true in sports and believed by athletes, especially in competitions like this.
Whose wheel of fortune is now in favour?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they have four, so I think luck is on our side at the moment", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans lead by four points with 12 points left in the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their sails and encouragement from his pair with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after a day of play.
Spieth played a killer tee to the green and can serve as an example to the others.
The cheers of the fans grew louder as Spieth and Thomas were two points behind, culminating in a crucial run by Spieth to a draw.
The journey he took to win the 15-hole playoff was followed by a similar cheerful roar that recognized the hope and faith that Americans can turn things around.
"You just have to concentrate and think about your game", Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
Europe's odd but irresistible pair has a maximum score and cannot go wrong.
The Mollywoods are the only pair to not lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided both the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari, shows that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than these two to seal the victory for the Europeans as the sun sets over Le Golf National in Paris.
Maybe both of them win at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's doubles match.
One bogey and two double bogeyes on the first nine holes of the course buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't dig out of.
However, on Sunday there will be no one to help individuals dig themselves out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch pair games up close because you can see the interactions of the pair players, hear the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and study the strategy that can change in the moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team, and they're coming in with a significant lead on the final day, but this paired game also showed that the U.S. team has the necessary fighting spirit, which some, especially the Stateside, have questioned.
The Europeans enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead.
The Europeans after Saturday's match play in the final day of the Ryder Cup are coming in with a significant lead over the USA of 10:6.
The dynamic duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods leads by four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in their quest to win the trophy they missed out on at Hazeltine two years ago, were superior to the American team in the morning's doubles match, scoring 3-1.
The U.S. team showed more fighting in the doubles, winning two games, but the points gap was already huge.
To win the trophy, Jim Furyk's team must collect eight points in 12 individual games played on Sundays.
Fleetwood is the first European team debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", are only the second pair to score four points in a paired game in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they proved themselves superior to the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by a 5-4 victory.
Woods, who had not shown the best performance in two Saturday games, had made some brilliant moves, but now has 19 losses out of 29 games in fourballs and pairs and seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose paused his morning fourballs to return with partner Henrik Stenson to the match play and suffer a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepke, the first and third best players in the world.
But for the Europeans, things were not going smoothly on a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and set the record high for their American team.
They first defeated Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, teams that were four points behind have made it back to the singles, even though Furyk's team only needs a tie to keep the trophy.
After two days of delay, it looks like their Sunday counterattack is going to be a tough sell.
North Korea has announced that there is no chance for unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions are increasing mistrust of the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea took "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and deciding to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States of America", he added.
"If we don't have faith in the United States, we don't have faith in our national security, and there's no way we're going to be the first to disarm unilaterally under these circumstances".
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization that would see sanctions on North Korea gradually lifted, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever meeting between the current US president and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim gave a promise to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the U.S. has made it a condition that Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also ignored calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearisation first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to force its way to its goal, even opposing the declaration of an end to the war, Ri added.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that continuing sanctions increases mistrust.
Ri did not mention whether there were any plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting that the US president had talked about earlier in the week at the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in have held as many as three meetings in the last five months and added: "If South Korea, not the US, had sought denuclearisation, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill".
Regardless, Secretary Ri's tone of speech was vastly different from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and declared that a missile strike on the continental United States was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim a "human missile" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, this year at the United Nations praised Kim for his courage in disarmament, but added that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearises.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearization and added: "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must strictly continue until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Riyadh at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea summoned him after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has arranged a meeting with Moon this month to discuss the dismantling of the missile site and nuclear complex that will take place if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim had revealed to him that these "appropriate measures" relate to the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on how to get good rest
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat the increasingly prevalent culture of caffeinated learning and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's best universities often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed what he believes is the first course of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea for the course after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of the lecture, this girl came up to me and said, "Why did I only find out about this in my senior year of college?"
She said that no one had told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The first class this year will teach students how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance and overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, says that the university decided to introduce the course after students were observed to have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks involves a picture of a student's dorm room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how lack of sleep affects performance, and the importance of a sleep routine.
During the class, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus is displayed with interactive icons that encourage students to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that student behavior won't change overnight.
But we feel that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect your health", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in studying all night before exams still exists, says the professor, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students prove that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Sleep also helps to combat obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, putting it in a state of starvation and causing constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his classes at Harvard freshman year.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, it plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar course of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm both at bedtime and at waking hours, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted from electronic display screens, as well as LED lights that can disrupt circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston and the Rangers 1-0 with a goal by Mengin, beating Gerrard's boys.
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Mage's goal cut into Steven Gerrard's poor defense and ended the game with a 1-0 win over Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to claim their first away win after a 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his side are now eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership-leading Hearts.
With seven minutes to go in the second half, the Rangers seemed to run out of inspiration and didn't seem to be able to even the score.
With the Rangers now down to sixth, Livingston has moved up to third by just one shot behind the Hibernians.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence sustained a head injury when a remote object was dropped.
Gerrard made eight changes to his flanks and so he drove past Ayre to the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, was going with the same Livingston lineup that took the Hearts to a draw last week and would have been delighted that his well-designed lineup would have stifled any attempt by the opposition.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston had more with it.
They had a chance to score two minutes after the first pitch by Menga, giving Scott Pittman a free kick to Allen McGregor's goal, but the passer missed the opportunity.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass a blunt kick to the back row.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game, they seemed to be playing with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have sentenced him to eleven at the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not heed the Colombian's request.
The Rangers managed to put two balls in the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hit by a head shot from Lassan Coulibaly and a subtle shot from Ovie Ejeria, which did not pose a major problem.
Although Livingstone's 34-minute play slowed the game, no one can deny their effort.
The Rangers again failed to take advantage of Jacobs' deep return.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his composure and chose Mengu for the single-seater finish.
Gerrard reacted during the halftime break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, the substitution almost having an instant impact as the winger added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his own line.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors into the exact game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long shot after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the closing moments, but McGregor was effectively disabling Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide shot from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton was late again for the 11th as he clashed with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way this time.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the following page from our Almanac in the Sunday Morning show: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago ...the day of the birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention, a device later known as the Geiger counter was developed.
A mainstay of science from that time, the Geiger counter became a mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Bells of Colorado, starring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in God's name is that?"
It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms reacting to the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "I can hear you, I can hear you!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
 The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of the treatment
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory
The cells are treated to be able to 'recognize' a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then they are injected back into the patient
An experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer was in remission for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to ' identify' a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from a patient and 'learning' them to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, has joined the debate about Trump and has supported him, wearing a cap that says "Make America Great Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West is whistled into a studio during Saturday Night Live after a break-out performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night called Ghost Town during which he wore a cap with the words "Make America Great Again", he continued to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so much, and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist.'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
Saturday Night Live opened with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual abuse allegations.
Although it was not broadcast, a recording of West's speech was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the article was Rock's attempt to out West.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was thrown offstage because of the hat he was wearing.
They were harassing me backstage.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat".
They bullied me!
They said I was sunk, reports the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "You want to see the bottom?" and said he'd put on his Superman cloak because it means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love.
Variety magazine wrote that his comments caused at least twice public displeasure, and Saturday Night Live members seemed embarrassed, with one person for the magazine stating, "The whole studio has gone silent".
West was brought in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle of mineral water, stunned many.
West backed Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU for standing up to the Mafia".
But the show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "did his thing and it was absolutely wonderful".
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music, clothes or supporting their artistic) who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
And we are, "she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name to follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His partner, rapper Snoop Dogg, was Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to the symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder with a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with the attempted murder of a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police are reporting an incident at Ballyhackamore.
The accused is due to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been hooked on toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the sword-wielding character in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has dealt with the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such TV roles often make boys feel that they must be tough to earn respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he wants to "face this problem very decisively".
"I personally feel very determined at this moment. Where did we go wrong with manliness?" he asked.
What did we teach men, as they grew up, in relation to the problem we see now?
Keith believes that television, thanks to its very masculine characters on the screens, may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He continued: "What is innate and what is learned?
What is it that's being taught on TV and on the streets that makes boys feel like they have to have these certain traits of a man?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong with the boys.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not shoot Game of Thrones sequels after its conclusion the following summer and said that he was "finished with the battlegrounds and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he feels that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him while filming The Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the set of that show, which gave me a family and a future", he revealed.
Rose was in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series playing Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
China reports a 14 percent increase in new HIV/AIDS cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are infected.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections are sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of contaminated blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities stated that there are almost no people who get infected with HIV this way.
Yet, each year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is increasing by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a persistent problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is high.
Studies estimate that because of conservative values in the country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of disease in such relationships occur because of inadequate protection during sex.
As part of an effort to address this problem, in 2003 the Chinese government promised free access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked information to the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
A Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles says that these claims are being spread by individuals on the "ultra-right wing" as well as websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters said on Twitter.
The leaked data allegedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information surfaced online Thursday, and was released by an unknown Capitol Hill source during a Senate committee hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have revealed that the IP address revealing the source of the data leak belongs to Congresswoman Waters' office, as well as information about a member of Congresswoman Waters' staff, The Hill newspaper reported.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
 A member of my staff  whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations  shall not be held responsible in any way for the leaking of such data.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and absolutely false.
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism online, including from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is a furious denial", Fleischer wrote.
It shows that Waters doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He must not be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
It has to be calm and steady.
It was felt that Fleischer was comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of acting too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running against Waters in the general election, also took to Twitter.
"It matters if it's true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed 'the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies' about these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed and that they bear the legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet", she continued.
The film review Johnny English: Back on the job  not enough interesting Rowan Atkinson fights the spy
It is now commonplace to seek out Brexit messages in every new British film, and it seems to be the case in the new screen adaptation of the action series Johnny English, whose first sequel, Johnny English, premiered in 2003 and returned to the big screen in 2011 with Johnny English Rides Again.
Will our own twisted satire on how apparently worthless we are become the new national export opportunity?
The inept Johnny English with his gouged eyes and rubbery face again has permission to complicate matters, while his name more than anything says that this is a comic creation for a broad audience designed for countries where cinematography is not in English.
He is, of course, a deranged secret agent who despite his bizarre claims of "dull" glamour resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr. Bean and somewhat resembles the guy who sang the opening notes of "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious worldly man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials and who is the embodiment of chaos.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie titles like "007" and "Mission Impossible" themselves offer elements of comedy.
In my opinion, Johnny English's wacky antics are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's mute gags embodied in Mr Bean.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
A hacker has broken into Britain's most secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents, much to the horror of the agent in charge, unfortunately played by Kevin Eldon in a brief appearance.
It was the end of the patience of the Prime Minister, a proud and war-loving figure who is experiencing the complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully portray the character that should represent Theresa May, but she has not really gotten the material to do anything with.
Her intelligence advisors reveal that all active spies have been compromised and therefore she will have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And that person will be the careless Johnny English with the head and the beard who is currently employed as the head of some fancy school, but in the background he teaches how to be a secret agent: here are some handsome gigs because English teaches rock-and-roll espionage.
The English are quickly brought to the government offices for an emergency meeting, where he is reunited with Bough, his former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely squandered.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything completely wrong are back in action and encounter the beautiful and fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, who is played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems, the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their thrilling journey with absurd and hilarious coincidences: disguised as waiters, they torch a fancy French restaurant, cause a huge mess by smuggling in Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headsets to find out what the inside of Volta's house looks like.
Everything is done right for this final sequel, but as engaging and as outrageous as the movie is, it still contains a subtle element of childishness.
A rather mediocre achievement.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I again wondered, could the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party is refusing to elaborate on a plan to make the British work four days a week and be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan whereby British workers would work four days a week and be paid for five days' work.
The party allegedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers and give them an extra day off.
That would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could "fit" into the party's economic program and plans to make the country more worker-friendly.
The trade union congress supported the move to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but it represents an aspiration that fits into the approach this party has towards balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to lend its support to such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not fully embrace this aspiration.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to elaborate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take power from the "personal managers" and "profit-makers" in the utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not be able to recover their full stake because the Labour government could make "discounts" based on perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 per cent of private companies' capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are speaking to "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency's conclusion could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any chance the FBI might discover something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more forthcoming than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I said I was coming to the hearing, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after those allegations were made, and asked: "Did you do it?"
He was determined, unwavering, unmistakable.
Graham's voice, however, is as if it were carved in stone.
"I'm determined on Brett Kavanaugh and it would really take a strong indictment to change that", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has been adamantly denying it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people she named could corroborate her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see that anything has changed.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will be hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive roster of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert goers had to complete a number of tasks or "activities" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making phone calls, or any other meaningful way of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, given that it has 12 years left to achieve its goals?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of "clicktivism" where people feel that by signing online petitions or tweeting, they are actually making a difference?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million actions by its followers who have sought to achieve a range of different goals.
It claims that these actions have encouraged world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than $37 billion impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Commission has also received a number of complaints from the GOC concerning the use of the term 'competent authority' in the context of the investigation.
The group estimates that the funds provided have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based investor and facilitator partnership that advocates for "helping children develop to their full potential", with a pledge to provide $35 million in aid to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past", said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Foundation, to an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the project The Power of Nutrition which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, which reads: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responds: "It's going to be a long and hard road - sometimes we'll fail.
But we will succeed, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us succeeded, because we are stronger together.
Performances by Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the acts at this year's New York event hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the navy as a 'blockade' to prevent Russian energy exports.
Washington can, "if necessary", use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, according to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is acting at the behest of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in the Middle East as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe", he says.
But in his view, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the opening of sea lanes and blockades, if necessary, to make sure that their energy doesn't reach the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which bills itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and substitute fuels", he said, and for Russia, he said, "the same trick is used in fossil fuel-dependent economies".
The announcement comes as the Trump administration plans to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia as a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "a captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic considerations and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a lever and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts state senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a live-streamed meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she's considering running for office herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the helm", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren has expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that he is "leading our country in the wrong direction".
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been openly critical of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of the voters supported the nomination.
The poll showed stronger support for former Gov. Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent voting for a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats discussed in connection with the potential 2020 presidential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make a formal decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the PTSP track Palina at the meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he reported for duty in September.
He's been arrested and charged in connection with a domestic violence incident that occurred Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he returns, is comparable to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers come back with", she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a common problem that is silenced and for her son and other war veterans she said they "come back a little different, come back hardened, come back wondering if they have any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the military, have given for this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a female, obstruction of a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a friendly report Friday in Washington to support the asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and violent members of his gang abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who backed Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new U.S. asylum policy has overturned an Immigration Board decision in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such an impediment violates that principle, the Friends of the Court report said.
Lawyers further argued that policies that deny entry to immigrants harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as casualties double in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly difficult.
"The situation is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her boy who was shivering with fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Emergency vehicles are bringing in bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through flooded things, trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwyane Harris, who suffered fractures to his back and shoulders, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors for the continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the feeling of a powerful earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
"I think I was trapped inside the ruins of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" through "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily promoting mutually beneficial trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday took aim at the paid supplement of the China Daily in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials in a statement to Reuters described as a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to put up ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, China's top agricultural exporter, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China is now "doubling down on this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a newsstand on the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will see no true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubling economic path because the media is under the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "some of the most prominent Chinese newspapers have rejected the offer to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Kavanaugh's debacle has alienated Republicans ahead of the midterm elections, analysts warn.
With many Republicans siding with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defending him over several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were very heated, and most Republicans had already shown that they still wanted to cast their ballots.
"Things like that can't come back", said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flack's latest insistence that the FBI investigate would be enough to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate hallway as the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrat will be beyond all expectations", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news.
People say they're already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among suburban women and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court Justice candidate, analysts are hinting that there could be a backlash if the Republicans continue with their confirmation.
"It's a real mess for the Big Old Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the bench, but the way the Republicans approached it and treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided over who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more inclined to him.
A new poll released by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony is true, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and the people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said, referring to the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal networked data storage" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique about personal online data storage is that the decision about who can access what information is entirely up to the users.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, the processes and the appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, a few engineers who signed on to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world have been able to build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they're going to make a complete change where all their business models are completely turned around overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new grid built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the award of the Victoria Cross to priests from World War I
A ceremony to honour the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a World War I veteran is being held in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel the Honorable Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military honor.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's quest earned him the accolade.
According to a report in the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front lines and with "incredible courage" led the troop forward before he single-handedly charged the Polish cannon and killed three of the troopers.
Lieutenant Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's deeds were "something I know I could never achieve, and that inspires humility".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that many people will give".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Piglet Peppu
Imagine this: you stay up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches only to end up unable to follow the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 matches, including six on the main card, and in the UK, it was shown live at night on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their match, the UK audience was left in shock when the broadcast was interrupted by the Pringle of Peppa.
Many were not impressed after being up until the early hours of the morning for the sake of fighting.
One fan described the interruption of the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
♪ I'm the one who's scared of Peppa ♪
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would be adjusting their schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I consider replaying, I think we can probably work something out", Coker said.
But the broadcast is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to get anything done until Sunday comes on for us, when it'll be Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was cut, there were many letters circulating that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. lt's a state-wide problem.
I can promise you that next time it won't be.
We're gonna hold five fights instead of the six we usually do, and we tried to give our fans more, but we went too far.
It's an unfortunate circumstance.
Tom Daley felt "inferior" when it came to sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that it was not until he entered high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he's speaking out on gay rights to give others a "reward".
He also said that winning the Olympics was less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a renegade on the first Laverne's Show, Daley said that during his childhood he felt "less than" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said, "Until now, those feelings of inferiority and difference from others were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed".
He says he wanted to prove he was "something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT advocate and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others a "gift".
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem for him.
When you're so young you go through so much  ̶ he looked back at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later ̶ he said it's hard to find someone his age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
In June they became parents to a son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, all the talk would have been about 'I have to win the gold medal,'" he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had got tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not gonna be here long enough to be in the front row,'" he said.
"I held his hand as he passed out, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I knew was that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
It was also the inspiration for the choice of the first song ̶ Proud by singer Heather Small ̶ which echoed in it during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which is always booed at.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to recover completely to avoid an unfortunate turn of events.
Mickelson, who is playing in this two-year-old event for a record-breaking 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and refining his game in the gym in hopes of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding course of Le Golf National, where the long, rough terrain routinely punishes inaccurate shots.
And if the field isn't scary enough, Mickelson's ninth match on Sunday is against the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who, with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are down by four points in 12 straight games, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man ̶ more than he could say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence.
He's famous and he's contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there would be more, but it turned out that way, and we felt that we had to do it.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else.
Mickelson will be beating Nick Fald's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
That could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence has also brought certain intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and is a great guy for the team", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European Fleet knows that a great advantage can soon be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead on the final day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The Dane made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, where captain Seve Ballesteros' team had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended in their victory by a narrow margin of 141⁄2 ̶ 131⁄2.
"You're constantly reminded that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a narrow margin", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 team that won 5-3 on Friday and led 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play with all your might.
Get out there and do it right.
Nothing's over until the floors are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who is standing against us - the greatest players in the world.
Thrilled by the performance of his players on the hard course, Bjorn added: "I would never run in front of a hole in this.
Tomorrow, he's going to face a different beast.
Tomorrow is the main single, and that's something else entirely.
It's great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're there as an individual, your golf skills are ultimately tested.
That's the message you need to get across to the players, and that's that they have to do their best tomorrow.
Now leave your teammate alone because he has to give his best.
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will require his players to play better individually than they did with their teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those big turning points of the last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up as the loser after Europa performed the "miracle" at Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to get excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, like what you saw in Medina.
When that bayou goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-flight swords.
"So we organized our lineup and we put the guys in positions like we were going to, you know, try to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahma, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter face the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
"I decided to put this group of guys in this order because I think it's inclusive", Bjorn said of the players he's picked for the individual fights.
A German new warship put on hold again
The German Navy's latest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reports, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling post-delivery issues have affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, it will have a powerful gun, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period ̶ it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for a period of up to two years without returning to home ports.
However, persistent delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships - which are said to enable Germany to show off its power abroad - will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were especially important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the number of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also proved that the ship was dramatically overweight, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - up from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the newest frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, acknowledged that the navy actually "lacks ships capable of deployment".
The official said that the problem had grown over time, as the old ships were put out of commission and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates can join the navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
New research at a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), will follow common and swamp dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and river bats in the gardens of Inverweather in Wester Ross.
Special cameras will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile handheld scans.
An expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the bat's voting frequency and what species do.
Then a habitat map and report will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
The Commission will continue to monitor the implementation of the measures and the implementation of the measures referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development works affecting shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can mold and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and pet attacks by cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained professionals, who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve on Threave's estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species native to Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a huge space for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitat.
However, there is still much we don't know about bats, so the work we are doing here and at other facilities will help us to better understand what they need to thrive".
It emphasises the importance of checking for bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, as the accidental destruction of one bat colony can kill up to 400 females and young, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is against the law to kill, torture or harass them or to destroy their habitats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Bat Conservation Society, urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are progressing".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has characterized the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people want to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers will be suing the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In a live video he posted to his 142 million Instagram followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to the hospital.
What they said today is fake news, says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous so they can say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", added the footballer with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
It is alleged that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly anal-rape her, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 percent" "good guy" who had been let down by that "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to call off the settlement because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: the UK will forever regret the loss of its car manufacturers
The UK will "regret forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Trade Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of waiting at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal, we will experience production bottlenecks at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager at Burnaston.
The UK authorities have not provided any evidence that the Commission has taken into account the fact that the UK is a member of the EU.
BMW, for example, says it's closing its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of "just in time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars that are made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota at its factory in Derbyshire could not hold more than a day's worth of stock, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that the 'Chequers' plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was 'precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks'.
"We have to make a deal, we want to make the best deal possible, which will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the success we have now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers shows that we absolutely must be able to continue this very successful chain of supply.
Toyota could not say how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite union, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs go, they never come back".
A government spokesman says: 'We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
A key meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed for another week as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the election, ties between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, has been a rumour in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied these claims.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amidst the announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
On questions about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press.
Some journalists would dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to a dislike of the "theatrical" behavior of television reporters, though she said, "I'm not going to stand in the way of the fact that they're messing around".
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more question-and-answer meetings than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've analyzed the numbers".
Briefings will continue to happen, Sanders said, but if journalists have the opportunity to ask a question directly to the president of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to make that happen a lot, and you've seen that in the last few weeks, and it's that you can talk to the president of the United States, and it's going to replace brief press conferences.
Trump regularly gives answers to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a casual and sometimes bizarre performance in front of a packed press conference.
The Minister for Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland over Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and wish for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to reimburse the cost of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I would like to emphasize again how much I appreciate the contribution of each of our staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He got to the line and just collapsed", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and sending him for further tests.
A spokesman for Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there are "no details on the type/scale of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, is playing his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being taken out of the game on Saturday, bringing his total to 18 for the season.
The UK authorities have also provided evidence that the UK authorities have not provided any evidence that the UK authorities have taken any action to prevent the UK authorities from granting the right to sell the property to the UK.
Under the Conservatives' new plans, foreign buyers will be charged higher fees when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The increase in the duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Trust expects to raise up to £120 million a year ̶ to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate for buying property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-wage earners.
The fee increase will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay UK tax, and the additional money will contribute to the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional charge ̶ which is added to the current charge, including the increase introduced two years ago on other homes and properties purchased for issuance ̶ may be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who are not resident in the UK, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to join the ranks of those who have their own homes.
Many of the country's affluent areas - especially in the capital - have become 'ghost towns' because of the large number of foreign shoppers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in tolls to help more young people get their first homes.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping up high property prices by taking but not exploiting land, and called on Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing to fix the housing shortage in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to forced evictions.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream - that every new generation should have a better life.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with their headquarters abroad, can buy homes as easily as able British citizens.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for many, and the shame of homelessness is still very real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland's manager one day.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North East club, who currently sit third in the Premier League, three points behind the leaders.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Lights after leading St Mirren to the Scottish Championship again last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could only come true if I was successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio. Ross has also been a coach for the club.
The former boss of Alloa Athletica says he didn't feel fear inheriting such famous names at such a big club, after previously turning down invitations to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Success for me at this point will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
'Because of its structure and content, this club unquestionably belongs in the Premier League,' he said.
It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful if I could get the club back there.
Ross is only entering the third year of his managerial career, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months experience as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloy recover from relegation to the third tier and took St Mirren from the edge of relegation to the title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalled of the takeover of Alloe.
I really believed that managing was what suited me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making a solid living, and enjoying some pretty successful moments.
But the game can be difficult.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life.
You can listen to the whole interview on Sportssound on Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to research
The summer heat wave has boosted revenues for Britain's financially struggling pubs, but it has also added pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars posted a 2.7 percent increase in revenue in July, but restaurant revenues were down 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the Office of the Comptroller General's Business Consulting, who compiled the data, said: "The continued good weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup run meant that July would be similar to the previous June, when pub revenues rose 2.8 per cent, with restaurants now even more affected.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant revenue in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are served mainly made much greater gains on a level playing field than restaurants suffered.
Food-based pubs have also been hit by the heat, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the bars and pubs they run, liquor sales rose 6.6 percent during the month, while food sales fell 3 percent".
Paul Newman, an analyst for the RSM for leisure and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8 percent annual drop in sales will be particularly painful because of continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for the food-service managers, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide a much-needed respite.
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the growth of brand shares.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Research reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social networking accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news has heightened fears of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "head" account that they showed to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, open secret social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake" Instagram accounts and references to photo-sharing websites.
The news has heightened fears of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students reported using a cleaned-up "main" account to show off to their parents, while also having private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site found a teenager who had encouraged the second words "forcing me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletics in the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to draw on her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by having her on the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland".
An American who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, out of his four Olympic golds, and is now a regular pundit for the BBC, after a transient ischemic attack, was unable to walk.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting, but he made a full recovery, learned to walk again and today to practice agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
Internet opinion on a commercial for a traitor who compares mothers to cows
A company that makes trailers has stirred a furore online by its advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of a product claimed to be "the world's first silent wearable traitor", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to showcase the freedom the new traitor gives mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to music that says, "Yes, I'm mime, but you don't see any tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't a whim, it's my breasts".
Then the chorus goes, "Pump it, pump it, feed it to the baby, pump it, pump it, husband my lady".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "wonders" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except they steal their babies a few days after birth", one person wrote.
Elvie's traitor discreetly fits into a breast-feeding bra.
Another person comments: "Understandably traumatic for mother and child.
But, yeah, why not use them to advertise the traitor to mothers who will be able to keep their babies?
Someone added: "A totally unrelated ad".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that her song was "too funny".
I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I could understand it, I'd buy one.
Giving milk made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product, she said.
Another person commented: This is a fun ad targeting mothers who give milk (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover they've all danced with discreet traitors tucked into their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who give up milk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Traitor, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go out during the time of the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the depiction of women and cows, we wanted to put the spotlight on betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new betrayal will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvie the traitor has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children being held has increased, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants and were afraid of jeopardizing their own ability to stay in the country by coming out and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households in the country are illegal, and a large portion of them are criminal aliens.
"We are therefore continuing the search for these individuals", said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelter workers, in an effort to expedite the process for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than the previous standard of 60 days.
Many will appear via videoconference rather than in person to present their case for legal status before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to statements by shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, signs of child abuse were likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma that many children are already dealing with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus will continue "the fight in this holy battle" until all Syrian territories are cleared of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return had been met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that have encouraged the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for political negotiations to resume.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive Syrian offensive, backed by Russia, into the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear timelines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, "who will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the committee's work should be limited to revising articles of the current constitution and warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump should win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would be without a doubt the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
There are no signs of viewer fatigue at this time.
Since 2014, prime time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on its prime time schedule, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed viewers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime time news nights.
"It's the fire that draws people in because it's about something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a secretary of state who becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell said.
There's an entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of abortion law stemming from Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you overreach the level of an informed citizen when you find yourself spending six hours watching a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used deep-background sources for his book Fear, the $15,000 Paul Manafort leather jacket, and the implications of intimate descriptions, well, of Mr. Trump's anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of what makes it a reality show is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "The Locker", about the rotating cast and daily intrigues of the Trump show.
You can't afford to miss a single episode because you'll be behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss' house this week, it was sunny outside his house on the north shore of Kauai with a temperature of 80 degrees, but he was inside watching MSNBC and simultaneously filming CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows, and people would say, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Outside money is pouring into the most uncertain midterm congressional race
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to congressional redistricting that has resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
This recently redrawn suburban district of Pittsburgh features Democrat Conor Lamb, who won the 2nd district seat last spring in a special election.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally cut in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign finance battle between the main party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. is considering whether to punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then pulls out.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to summon the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
However, penalties are only being considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include reduced financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for a middle-American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as a breakthrough in efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made clear that they wanted the conference to take place and had effectively suspended any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
The story
Next in line could be special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign has colluded with Russia as part of its attack on our election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face the responsibility of that body, just as he prepares to stand again before the voters, and perhaps ultimately a jury of his peers.
There are many such cases, and I don't want to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr. Trump - or those like him in Europe - is imminent.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only for the West to oppose him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such inflection points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this paper reported that last year he secretly suggested a president's recording and speculated about his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
"How are we to respond if the recently ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress that will call Mr. Trump to account?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep the long winter's sleep.
But I believe we will not fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once dined in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of the face-off against Rapid of Vienna
Rangers host Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury has prevented striker Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could do something and we took a point.
We may have stolen the game in the end, but, in general, the tie is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second half.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can get the three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough one, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's some good feeling.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Let's hope that we can now move on, put the past behind us and be successful.
Women can't sleep for fear of their retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide study said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they don't take steps to start a conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Organize your legal documents: Prevent legal battles from the start.
Hire healthcare representatives to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider giving them power of attorney to manage your finances.
You want to select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer some questions about medication and allergies?
Put the details in the written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's also about who the doctors are", Martin asked.
What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan handy.
Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air rifle shots as he returned home after a night out.
The victim, in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as an "intentional act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with more deaths expected.
With communications cut off, relief officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggale province, an area north of Palua that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The town was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a district stretching along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The district, an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of Sulawesi's economy, especially the coastal Donggala region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggali.
The tsunami also hit western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree quake struck south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily shut down thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and holding on to an unsecured bond of $500, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, of course", the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A felonies, which means he could be facing up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December of 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and possession of weapons while intoxicated related to the incident.
His girlfriend testified that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Hundreds killed by tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks are down, and we're expecting a surge in casualties in the coming days.
The quake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Video of the moment of impact is circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare sentence for a federal crime not carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a stabbing attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, where he stabbed pedestrians and bicyclists who got in his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted grievous bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of which lead to a possible death sentence, according to the court filing.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov's federal grand jury struck a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of assault and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required "conscious planning and foresight", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "vile, cruel and corrupt".
The intention to use the military force of the DPRK to further the repression of the DPRK's civilian population and to further the repression of the civilian population of the DPRK is also stated in the resolution of the DPRK's Security Council on the situation in DPRK.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to have an ISIS flag hung in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipovlev's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a Conservative conference today.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to 'feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics' as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have come out by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by Tory-leaning Remainers joining a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her "Chequers" compromise plan going amid attacks from Brexit supporters, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wants to get rid of the Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must get the Chequers out".
Raising his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in the world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain is completely incorrect.
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also in the parade, addressing the press with the words: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.
In her distinguished message to Mrs May she added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they deliver on their promises.'
Farage told the crowd that politicians must make themselves "feel the pressure" if they are going to back down on the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'you're not gonna get away with it.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the supporters of the remnant marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists waved "Tory anti-Brexit" banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the 'Canada plus plus' plan, for unfettered border conditions, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit, he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at a face-to-face meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign co-chairman in 2016.
She's been the center of speculation for some time that she might be running against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the public since Trump took office.
A co-worker asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the top.
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police have released information about the arrest of 20-year-old Dython Simpson at an ET news conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, on 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime and possessing the weapon and to killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year, 6'6" student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games for the first 10 teams last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world championship title after his order secures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the team order would play a big role in the race.
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went into the box first and left Hamilton to enter the pit lane, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a wheel-to-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver reluctantly leaving the interior open to the danger of being overtaken after a double move to the defending third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
Then he drove for a good part of the race, relying on his tyres to make a quick finish and pass Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
He finally made it to the box on lap 44, but was unable to pick up his pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a hard day because Valtteri has been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a gentleman to let me pass.
"The team did a really outstanding job to get the formation finish", said Hamilton.
That was very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence on not releasing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what had happened in the Senate had shown that people were "evil and nasty and dishonest".
"The one thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and nasty and dishonest", he said.
When you look at the publications and leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do that.
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer...did you release the document - , what?
Oh, no, you won't.
I did not.
Just wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing the allegations Ford made against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information came from her office.
"I did not withhold Dr. Ford's allegations, "I did not release her story to the public",
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, which is what she asked.
However, her denial did not meet with the approval of the president, who remarked at the gathering on Saturday night: "Let me tell you something - it was very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use the allegations to their own ends.
They are determined to regain power at any cost.
You see the cruelty, the ugliness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample over to get to power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5 ̶ 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have made up for their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a win at Dundee on Saturday by 5-3
The Giants got an early lead on two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lundvald Nielsen sealed the victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening touchdown came in the fourth minute, exactly at 3:35, with an assist from Kendall McFaul, followed by an assist from David Rutherford to double the lead with a shot from Beauvillier four minutes later.
In a heated opening game, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 1 1 0 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie to tie the game at 1 1 5 1 6 minutes.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first quarter with a lead when he gave up his second goal that night at the end of the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again brought them to a tie in the power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to Dundee's first lead late in the second quarter, and he took charge of the victory when his team were already halfway through the last third of the game for the fifth time.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will host a team from Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board the plane avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was hailed a hero after he was killed while ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful earthquakes are still affecting the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Paluu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, which was shaking violently.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321 which was on the tarmac at the time.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Palua.
"Our hearts are breaking for this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be rising as many bodies are still under the rubble and many could not be reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of up to six meters have devastated Pala where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance is arriving with the body.
The government is short of clean water.
There are small shops being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?
Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one man is being reported missing after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that owns the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims one man is listed as missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they were unable to track down one of the passengers.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and locate the person in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline says six passengers were hospitalized Saturday, and all are in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to get through the water that was up to their waist and to the exit in case the plane was in danger of sinking.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby on dock repair also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the mainland before the plane sank in about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
The FCA also provided information on the FATA's activities in the areas of air transportation, logistics, transportation and logistics, including the provision of air transport services.
An analyst is putting out a weather overview of the night the woman was burned alive.
The U.S. Attorney's office on Saturday concluded a retrial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone data to piece together a puzzle about the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data he got from several cell phones showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which contradicts his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers's at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying" because his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, for a period of time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He cut her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is enlightened hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the genre's negative attitude by infusing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based vocal group, claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its political message and social commentary beginnings.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are being reborn in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for firing her after a "racist" message.
A nanny in New York suing a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a misdirected text from her mother calling her "just another black woman".
The couple denied being racist, comparing the accusation to "adulteration".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned on her first day of work in 2016 that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"There is no other woman", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "unfortunate" situation, firing Mrs. Maurice, because, she claimed, their then-former nanny, who was African-American, was doing a poor job, and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance pay and is seeking $350 a day for the six months she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do such things", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered the claims of being racist, saying that ending Mauric's employment was the sensible thing to do, for fear that the insult would make her untrustworthy.
My wife didn't mean what she said in the text.
She's not a racist.
"We are not racists", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone who was rude to you, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on, you know what?
Plasco said that his wife got only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
You're gonna sue somebody in that situation
"That's not very nice", added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would identify with a talking teddy bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who will be reading the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny what we now know about Paddington's huge success.
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write a children's book, would have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with happiness and sadness following his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was a rather quiet man and not a braggart", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt like a child's achievement: you're proud of him even though none of it was really your doing.
I think Paddington's success was viewed that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always credited Paddington.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad has been calling regularly to say that it's really bad and they don't believe he's going to make it", Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called me to tell me that she was gonna die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medication that doctors had given her to keep her heart beating had slowly lost its effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before we boarded, and then everything went dark.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all inside.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I lowered my head, and tears kept streaming down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong sense of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Message from women grieving on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with a contagious smile who was looking forward to a glittering career.
Everyone remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill any room with joy.
However, before his death he left the job because he was in a "really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to have a negative effect".
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of the cards so people would know that there's someone you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence ̶ you have to talk. 
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling sad, depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behaviour.
At Christmas, he was at the bottom of the barrel when the kids opened their presents, didn't look them in the eye or want anything else.
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to get over it: "It all leaves a big hole in the family.
He's tearing us up.
But we'll keep going and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought we might be able to bring a little bit of unity if we really managed to get something like what he was asking for - a limited in time and scope investigation", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the board would "break up" amid entrenched partisan blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is prompted by a choice of moment.
The midterm elections are coming up in just five weeks, on November 6th - if, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the desired man elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush keeps calling senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has made its report?
The vote will be in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break through with a decisive vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'dropped' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing the United Southern Federation Ministry data, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 defectors last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors are tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and higher fees that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors eventually acquired South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and South - still technically at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean foreign minister, blamed the US sanctions for not making any progress since then.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it is not in the cards to be the first to disarm under such circumstances", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Opposition Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that his temper made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that a woman who ever behaved like that would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was highly emotional, occasionally nearly screaming and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the board, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated smears" staged by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't participate in the work of the Supreme Court because it showed he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
When asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed and if the Democrats win a majority in the House, Pelosi backed down.
"I'll say this: If he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be on not only the Supreme Court, but the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law stemming from Roe v. Wade, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh has sidestepped questions about whether he'll overturn any Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with that.
Justified criticism, anger that has been accumulating for months and years - all of it can't be gotten rid of without tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, what do you think?
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be a business executive and who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but she developed a technique where, when she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was angry.
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, is how, on one occasion, when I was crying with unspoken rage, an older woman - a cool manager who I had always been a little shy of - pulled me up to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they've got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
"It was not a well-considered decision", she told me laughingly 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race, and they certainly didn't need another.
Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was already behind schedule, she was behind on fundraising, and she vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her followers, who had given the men $1,000 each, had given only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she asked herself.
As she spoke about not launching a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism - that her throat was squeezing.
"You would think I'd had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder remembered the media reaction to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were gonna put on my tombstone.
She cried.
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The start of the trade war between the US and China has been loudly echoed, and while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired off the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has always retaliated in some way, and recently imposed tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to strike back at the United States, and the world's second largest economy is certainly not going to give up anytime soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by easing demands, but public submission to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the US trade war could provide long-term positive support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for an economic upheaval in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have believed", said Abigail Grace, a strategic thinking fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country that has been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorist attacks to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would benefit from help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or the help of countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 ̶ 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling through most of the tournament, on the par-3 16th hole, sent the ball into the water on the first stroke, handing the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds and become one of only 4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out of the tournament by Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-ranked player on the European team, with a 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia of Spain has become the European's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
I don't normally cry, but today I can't stop my tears.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have won the cup again.
"I'm happy to have been able to help", said Garcia, who was overcome with emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ramu who, in singles on Sunday, defeated the legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, by a score of 2 and 1.
"I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing top-level golf all tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard".
At certain points we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off my hat to Thomas.
He's a hell of a captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take the hood off people.
We're being played.
New red tide data: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, conditions of heterogeneous algae blooming are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide stretches about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
