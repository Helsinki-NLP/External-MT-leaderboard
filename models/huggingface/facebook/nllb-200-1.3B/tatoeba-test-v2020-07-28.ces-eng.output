She doesn't know any of us.
I'm happy with my work so far.
You really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
I have a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting, even though I was invited.
Hey, are you still here?
I thought you were probably dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
The dream was a mystery to me.
You must have paid a lot for it.
Tom is obviously lying.
Straight and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom will be 13 the day after tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch her ruin her life.
Do everything with balance.
I'm just buying soft toilet paper.
Yes, you must.
We climbed to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
The belt's too tight.
It's not easy to play the bassoon.
She only took the job to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as many as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are rapidly dying out today.
Tom is still busy.
You'd better leave now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to interrupt, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as pretty as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in 17th-century costumes.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
With great effort he climbed the tree.
Translating a Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing too.
We know all that, Tom.
I'm glad you brought this to my attention.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I'll be out of town for a week.
Who sent you?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a very kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
The drops are falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like the tie.
We didn't do as well as we'd like.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back by tonight.

The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
He bought a car.
I'm afraid I'm going to be stuck here forever.
Tom put on an enema.
What should I do in this situation?
Do you take the train to school?
Tom won't be in school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who is Tom visiting?
Tom is to blame, not Mary.
How about you buy me a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I wouldn't be surprised if it did.
He's free to go.
That's not what people normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a flea when she got the record deal.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you had helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's visiting his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary could.
I can autograph you if you want.

Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary by the hand.
I'm perfectly happy.
You did what you had to do.
We have to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I'm not going to be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There were half-destroyed walls.
I spoke to him in English and found out I could get along.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Have any of you ever talked to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence's freshly painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you're going to regret it.
You've gained weight.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I dare not open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting a divorce from her.
I bought one bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal. I don't want anyone else to read it.
He's not married, as far as I know.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own two feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we had a laugh.
Tom is wrong, isn't he?
Better dead than red alive.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he's going to say.
The wedding was last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse is barking.
I lent Tom a comb.
I'm such a bore.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not that kind of a stick anymore.
You're not going to believe what Tom just told me.
Mary has no one to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go for a walk.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'm going to get a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
It used to be bigger.
I assume he went home.
I was in the woods.

He asked me to wait there until he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I should get back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He has his own house.
I don't usually do it at night.

Sweep it under the carpet.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's cute.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom is home.
Throw the ball to Tom.
I'm going to insult her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I was a better person.

Tom has to get his hair cut.
You should consult your lawyer first.
You're a good reporter.
Tom is used to that.
I love this book.
The garbage is back in the truck.
When I came home from work, I found out that someone had stolen our apartment.
Read the book.

I know you're still not happy.
Could the report be true?
Easy to get, easy to lose.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
