Members of Parliament in the Peyi de Gale (AMs) are concerned about 'looking like puppet'
There is concern among some members of the House of Representatives that their actions should be changed to Members of Parliament (MWPs).
The result was a plan to change the name of the Parliament to the Pei de Gale Legislative Council.
Members of the House in the political arena were concerned that they would be disgraced.
A member of the Labour Party's Executive Committee said the party was concerned that the practice "sounds like Twp and Pwp".
For non-Galean readers: Twip means fool in Welsh and pwp means a fool.
A Plaid Party Board member said the entire party was "displeased" and made further suggestions.
A representative of the pro-choice movement in Peyi de Gale said the representative party was "ready to accept different views" about the name change, but stressed that there was no significant difference between the terms MWP (parliament) and Muppet (Gippe).
It is in this context that the Welsh letter w is pronounced as Yorkshire English speakers pronounce the letter u.
The House Committee, which is currently preparing a bill to rename the House, said: "The immediate decision of the meaning of the appointment of the members of the House shall be taken by the members themselves".
The 2017 Government of Pei de Gale Act authorized the members of the Council of Pei de Gale to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on a popularly supported proposal for a Parliament called the Pei de Gale Legislature.
On the issue of the Members' Action (AM) the Commission gave the most options for them to be called Members of Parliament of Peyi de Gale or WMP, but the MWP's choice was strongly supported by public consultation.
The House seemed to offer other options, but a deal was difficult for the current Speaker, Elin Jones, who is expected to pass a bill on the amendment in weeks.
The Reform Act includes other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules governing the dismissal of members of the Assembly (AM) and the composition of the committee.
The members of the Assembly shall vote unanimously on the question of whether to be summoned when they discuss the bill.
Macedonians went to the referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A general election was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece's neighbor, Macedonia.
The Greek government from Athens has insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is identical to the name of its region and has made Greece a frequent refusal to join the European Union and the military aid organization known as NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the election's name change, said he would not vote.
However, supporters of the movement, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is the only cost they can pay to join the EU and the military aid organization known as NATO.
The St. Martin's Church is not mentioned when the churches in Harlem are facing crisis.
"Historically, adults I have spoken to have said that there was a temple in every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is nothing".
He said the lack of turtles was understandable.
"People ask in different ways these days", he says.
"We are no longer the traditional conversation where people go on a regular basis".
Regarding temples, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as the authorities expect, "and soon things will return to normal".
He added: "The temples that can be replaced with the apertures have many rooms filled with people of different races who will not help the temple to remain sacred.
"The vast majority of the residents are white", he said. "So the days of the closure of the temples will be reduced altogether, because it is not common for those who move into the rooms to become members of the temples".
Churches built by a white congregation before Harlem became a predominantly black city - urban settlement in 1870, St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The white Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The Black congregation that was worshiping nearby immediately named the temple.
The St. Martin's Chapel was built by members of the Black Congregation under the leadership of the Archdeacon John Howard Johnson, who once organized small businessmen on 125 Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, and refused to hire or promote black people.
The 1939 Great Fire severely damaged the building, but when the residents of the Parish under the leadership of Pastor Johnson were planning to rebuild, they sold the barn.
Senior Pastor David Johnson, son of Pastor Johnson and the founder of St. Martin's Church, is proud to call the church "the church of the poor".
The expert who spoke out in July called the attack by other names: "moral property" and"inheritable historical device".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the world's first flute to be sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played the great flute in the Riverside Cathedral 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin never succeeded him.
The events of St. Martin's a few months ago were an incomprehensible account of the architects who signed the treaty, some brought by the lay clergy of the church, others brought by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish's governing council, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "look for a way to pay" the priory, although the priory has nothing to do with hiring architects and signing the diocese's mandate.
Some inhabitants of the parish complained that there was no light work being done on the part of the diocese.
A fish bug injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting for water tigers in California
Authorities said a fish was injured by a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving in search of water lobsters in California on the opening day of the season.
The landing occurred just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon waterfront in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were about to be robbed for about thirty minutes on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and they came in a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought it was the joyful noise of chasing the water tiger, but then "he realized it was the screaming, 'Wow!
He ate me!'
What Hammel saw when he reached the boy: The whole bone of the shoulder was coming out,
Hammel continues: "I shouted out to everyone to get out of the water: 'Look, I'm a fish out of the water!' "
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is currently in critical condition.
The species of the fish that attacked the fish is unknown.
In a press conference with Captain Larry Giles of the Marine Rescue Service, he said that the fish was found in the areas a few weeks ago, but it was not found to be a problematic species of fish.
Giles went on to say that the fish victim suffered severe injuries to the upper chest.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of fish that live in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury is approaching Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a high-end department store product line and specialist customer support.
As part of a major move to the £2.8bn UK beauty market, which continues to grow as the fashion and home furnishings industry continues to decline, beauty retailers will be tested in 11 stores across the region and reach out to other stores next year when they are proven profitable.
Aesthetic investing is like tracking how the development markets use the space of the stairs used to set up TVs, microphones and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it could double the volume of beauty products sold to 3,000 retailers, including major brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Models from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have enough space to offer products from major manufacturers as well as from retailers such as Boots.
The development market is also re-launching a beauty shop to make most of the products suitable for vegetarians; a requirement that continues to be met by younger consumers.
And, the fragrance shop's perfume dealer will explore how to operate two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping is a shift from buying small amounts of food every day in supermarkets, which means that supermarkets have to do more to attract people to them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will grow as a grocery store as retailers try to cope with the price-cutting efforts of Aldi and Lidl, who offer more and less food-related services.
Sainsbury's has expanded Argos's retail portfolio to more than a hundred stores and has also opened Habitats stores as it has bought the brand name from both stores two years ago, which has increased sales and resulted in higher profits.
A pilot project by a major pharmacy that converted its beauty and pharmaceutical subsidiaries ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted to merge business operations with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger ended in a disagreement that resulted in the distribution of revenues from pharmacies to its supermarkets.
The new measures come after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacies to Celesio, who owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million over the past three years.
Lloyds is reported to have been involved in the scheme, adding other low-cost brands of body oil including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief marketing officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the way things look to you in a beauty shop to improve the quality of our customers' prices.
We also invited our specially trained colleagues who will be nearby to give advice.
Our races are designed to accommodate every need and attraction and be in the right place, which means we are now the kind of people who need beautiful equipment that will replace the old fashioned way of life".
Peter Jones 'got very angry' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones became 'exasperated' after television presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million business deal in a high-profile lifestyle deal to focus on his new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their homewear and jewelry company Truly.
The two's business relationship is represented by Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop company.
The 37-year-old reporter for This Morning went to Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' actor Peter Jones furious after stepping down from the business of a high-end financial services company at the last minute to focus on his own lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Reporters said Jones was "exasperated" when the TV star admitted in a big interview on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal was worth about £1.5 million; meaning she no longer has enough time to find a place for a home-gown clothing company known as Truly.
The business is modelled after Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and is expected to double Willoughby's £11 million capital.
While Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones flew from England to one of his holiday homes.
"It's not really as close to what Holly had prioritized", the reporter said.
What a long future he would have for decades to come.
His decision to leave was a surprise to all who watched.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, as it was about to begin.
There is a store full of merchandise in Marlow HQ ready for sale".
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning's leading UK investor, the company could lose millions due to a massive investment in products ranging from locks and bells to home-made clothing and accessories and a further delay in launch.
And it may mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby has three children with her husband Dan Baldwin who were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as CEO in March.
Both families are vacationers and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin TV programming company.
Willoughby is expected to become an ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
"We can't talk about his business activities", Jones's source said the next night.
We had a strong conversation and "loved one another"
He joked about his media criticism, suggesting that some would consider it "inappropriate for the president" and that he was a strong supporter of the North Korean leader.
Why did the President give so much?
Trump spoke in a critical manner in a "reading news" voice.
"I never gave".
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after the previous meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step in getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
But talks on the cessation of nuclear weapons are slow.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not receive a "correct response" from the US to North Korea's early nuclear disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said the United States is enforcing sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump made a confident statement in his campaign speech.
"North Korea is well-connected", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people have died.
Now we have this wonderful marriage".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, halting the missile tests, helping to free prisoners and allowing the remaining American workers to return home.
And she spoke about her unique way of talking about her relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded room, we would have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia hit the island, killing more than a hundred people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, international intergovernmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national outbreak has been reported, which is a priority for international funding.
"Unfortunately, it was mostly obvious that they would not be asking for international support, so it's difficult", said Mr Sumbung.
While Save the Children is looking for a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign workers can work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Institute of Disaster Management, said that Indonesian authorities would be reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to make a humanitarian contribution.
Because of the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is often vulnerable to disasters without preparation.
While a tsunami farm was built in Aceh, this is not the case in other parts of the Gulf.
The absence of any tsunami warning, despite the warning system, is likely to have contributed to the deaths.
Often, travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Disasters make equipment more difficult.
A hospital boat was parked in Lombok to rescue the victims of the earthquake on its way to Palu, but it will take less than three days to reach the new disaster area.
In his campaign, President Joko Widodo poisoned Indonesia's damaged infrastructure projects to get elected and misused the funds for road and rail construction.
But the lack of funding for various projects has been a major factor in Joko's re-election campaign next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the interfaith wars in Indonesia where a large number of Muslims have become more conservative in their beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim youths fought in the streets, using spears, arrows and arrows and other traditional weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the opening goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Champions League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge was hit by Xherdan Shaqiri at a 27-yard range from Chelsea's 1-0 loss.
The ball moves to his left before shooting into the second ball.
The shot went to the top right corner of the frame.
The ball came down through the mouth of Arnabella and the net was shaken.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: "I tried to get to that position again to get the ball and players like Shaq always played as close as possible, so I tried to find a way to get the ball as close as possible.
"I saw Kante come and touch the ball once, I didn't think much about it and I shot".
Chelsea led 1-0 in the first half after scoring a 25-minute goal against Belgian legend Eden Hazard.
The blue-clad forward gave Mateo Kovacic a pass for the match, before rushing to the club's centre and joining Liverpool.
Kovacic immediately pulled the ball into the middle of the field.
He then fires a very good shot at Hazard on the web site.
Hazard ran away from the guard and threw the ball into the net with his left foot through Liverpool defender Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Group Stage of the European Champions League, the first ever European Championship, at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Management Agency said in the early hours of Sunday.
It was reported that many people were left in the ruins of a house damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday that hit a 6 meter high earthquake, the company spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Pallas, with a population of over 380,000, is filled with ruins that fell from the roof.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from a stabbing wound in Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked residents of the area who saw or heard anything to come forward and report.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan, Criminal Investigation Officer, said: "The investigation is still in progress but I would like to ask anyone in the area of John's Road in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to inform us.
I would be happy if everyone - especially taxi drivers - could have their own cameras and dashboards to let us know because they might have important information about the investigation we are conducting.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was found in the Birkenhead area of the house.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as the police said that a way was being prepared to notify the deceased's immediate family.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to return to the second floor of his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He said what he was saying when he heard what had happened.
Now residents have been told that it will take hours for them to be allowed back in.
A police officer was notified that the entire area would now be considered a crime zone.
A woman is seen crying in the scene of sin.
"It's very scary", he continued.
At 2 p.m., two police officers were standing outside the crime scene and another bomb was parked outside.
Several police officers were standing in front of the crime scene checking the various floors.
Anyone with information is required to immediately write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or notify the Crime Prevention Department, known as Crimestoppers, anonymously on 0800 555 111, as noted in report 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell pottery in Parliament has become the latest monument to the 'recording of history' challenge
Such a ban on the crucifixion would be considered a punishment for the destruction of British cultural and religious institutions similar to those committed by the Taliban by Puritan fans and followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's wish as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society, said: "There was no escape from this discussion about the removal of the pottery depicting Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
It is a replica of the English Civil War, and none of it was ever criticized or opposed by Cromwell.
Cromwell's worst hanging was the actions of his first-century ancestor Thomas.
The expression of the Hon. William Hamo Thorneycroft in Cromwell is a symbol of the 19th century in the field of any of the historical aspects of pottery that many believe are still to be appreciated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, more late in the 19th century than today, to have apologized for the failure of Parliament to meet the outside shadow of its imperialist rule.
This is a matter that is still being debated in the Senate.
The fact is that the mid-17th century conflict was caused by the development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and memory".
A Chinese farmer was eaten to death by a guinea pig.
A farmer was killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to media reports.
The man, known only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead from a ruptured tendon, filled with the dead blood of a pig's nest in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to protect pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly went to his cousin's house in neighboring Yunna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the pig barn was already open.
He said that in the pig's barn there was a pig's goat with blood in its mouth.
Scientific evidence has confirmed that a 226-pound pig ate the breeder to death, according to the report.
His cousin referred to him by another name: "My cousin's legs were bloody and heavily bruised", according to his quotation by the Guiyang Evening News.
A video captured by security cameras showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent another attack while the police were collecting evidence of the crime.
Yuan's family and the market leadership said they were discussing the mourning of his death.
Although rare, the swine fever that affects humans has existed since ancient times.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple at their ranch in Massachusetts, leaving a man seriously injured.
For the first ten years, a 295-pound pig grabbed a Pei de Gale farmer from his car until a woman rejected the pig and released him.
After a Oregon breeder ate his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not uncommonly aggressive but that eating blood may be the "cause of the aggression".
"They want to play.
They are sleepy, they are very curious ... they are not meant to bother you.
You have to respect them properly", he said.
Winds from the northwest of the tropical storm Rosa brought heavy rainfall to much of the southwestern United States
Regarding weather, the southern tip of the fast-moving tropical storm Rosa is becoming more and more discouraged as it crosses the cold waters of northern Mexico's coast.
However, the northern part of the rapidly approaching Rosa will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Tropical Storm Rosa had winds of 136 km/h (130 mph), which was the highest Category 1 to 5:00 a.m. Tropical Storm on Sunday, and was detected at 620 km (620 mi) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the storm is beginning to intensify in the Pacific Ocean and is moving westward along the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to intensify into tropical calm in the North and Southwest.
Rosa will bring up to 25 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Now, the tropical weather will be matched by a storm that is approaching, causing heavy downpours in the southwest in the coming days.
In this area, rainfall can range from 2.5 cm to 10 cm, causing heavy flooding, erosion of damaged debris, and desertification.
Heavy tropical weather will cause rainfall of 5 to 7 cm per hour at once; particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 cm is expected in the southern regions, mostly in Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible where it may be reduced gradually as the tropical rainfall falls.
It may not be a good idea to walk into the desert where it may rain in the tropics.
Heavy rainfall can turn the valleys into torrents and thunderstorms can cause strong winds and dust to leak.
The upcoming storm will bring heavy rainfall to areas of southern California near the coast.
Rainfall of up to 1 cm (1 inch) could cause minor damage to flow and cause flooding on roads.
This would be the first rainy season in the region.
Some of the tropical rainfall from different locations will begin to approach Arizona during the peak hours of Sunday and early Monday, before falling frequently during the peak hours of Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will hit parts of the Four Corners on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may be a significant change in temperature in the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics keep warming.
Sometimes it results in significant changes in temperature including small distances.
There is a significant example of a large difference in average temperature in the United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of approximately 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to come and go again.
Most of the Central and Eastern United States is expected to experience temperatures from October to around 26 degrees Celsius from the Southern Plain to the Northeastern Plains.
New York City may reach 26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is nearly 10 degrees Celsius above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates that there is a high probability of a higher-than-average temperature reaching the eastern half of the United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people have seen the fascinating testimony of former Supreme Court president Brett Kavanaugh and a woman accused of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, through six television screens.
Meanwhile, political tensions continued, with television reporters interrupting a regular Friday talk at the last minute: It was a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a criminal investigation of the accused within a week.
Ford told the Senate Appropriations Committee that he was 100 percent confident Kavanaugh had overreacted to his drinking and tried to strip him of his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, an emotional witness, said he was 100 percent sure that this never happened.
It is highly likely that more than 20.4 million people were notified by Nielsen on Friday that they had seen it.
The company is currently calculating the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available from other television providers including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people watching in the office.
For clarity, they are the same number of people who are in the pay-per-view or presenting Academy Awards.
Nielsen: Fox News Channel, with a strong guest audience, strongly supports Kavanaugh's campaign, leading other channels with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the day-to-day broadcast.
ABC was the number one show with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen: CBS was watched by 3.1 million, NBC by 2.4 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million and CNN by 2.52 million.
There is still much more interesting after the interview.
Flake was the focus of Friday's events.
After the Republican office of the electoral college voted in favor of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and was attacked by protesters as he tried to enter the elevator to attend the Justice Committee hearing.
He stared down for several minutes as he was being bullied, which immediately went on CNN.
One woman said, "I stand here before you".
"Do you think he speaks truth to the entire nation?
She was told, "You are stronger when so many women are weak".
Flake said his office was a surprise and said he had already spoken out in committee hearings before the elevator closed.
Television and television stations were flooding in just hours after the Judiciary Committee voted to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the next level for a Senate election.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI wanted to investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which a few Democrats demanded.
Flake was reported to be among the participants of the interview with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After interviews with Coons and other senators later, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was strong, as it was clear that Republicans should not vote to convince Kavanaugh that no investigation was being conducted.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the crimes against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses her critics of "political play" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, arrived at the Conservative Party's Council in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In a subsequent press interview on the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked his Brexit-EU relationship plan in the press, saying that the idea that both the UK and the EU should pay taxes was "absolutely unusual".
Wayde Sims scandal: Police arrested the suspect, Dyteon Simpson, in the death of an LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Police released a video of the Sims-Simpson clash and Police said Sims lost his flashlight in the clashes.
The CBS affiliate WAFB reports that the police picked up the evidence at the scene of the crime and claimed it was found to be Simpson's DNA.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His lawyer says the bail for his temporary release is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office of Homicide Investigation released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the victim died from gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The Police Department is grateful to the Louisiana Police Station for the Investigation of Fugitive Offenders, the Police Station Crime Control Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked local police for their "consciousness and vigilance to ensure fairness".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his stepfather, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "deeply saddened" by Waydeh's death.
"This is what we are always worried about", Wade says.
A volcano erupted in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern edge of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Management Agency warned Mexicans against approaching the volcano after it re-ignited its temperature and reportedly released 183 gases from the earth in more than 24 hours.
The camp was experiencing many hardships and tragedies.
Public images showed ash covering the front windows of a car in a Mexican city block such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the city during a 7.1 magnitude volcanic eruption in central Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano has been erupting since 1994.
Police are among the activists for Catalan independence ahead of the anniversary of the independence elections
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters called on the protest police to calm the protests, and thousands more were found in the demonstrations marking the anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A masked group of pro-independence provincialists were pushed back by the protest-reducing police where they were beaten with red eggs, creating a dark cloud of dust in the streets, usually filled with tourists.
The fighting broke out in the hours leading up to the day when the police were using a riot to quell the fighting.
Independence groups sang for hours "We will not forget, we will not forgive" against the protesters who were campaigning for the future independence and chanted "Spain will live forever".
A local newspaper reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
The disagreement between the independent party continued for a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but welcomed by the independence activists.
Voters chose independence, although few voters came out as opposed to independence came out in large numbers to block the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police banned the continuation of elections at various local elections in a violent clash.
On Friday, pro-independence groups had camped at night to avoid protests in support of the National Police.
Protests took place but were forced elsewhere.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined the independence protests with his wife, said there was no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year was a good year", he says.
I saw my parents crying tears of joy because they were able to vote but now we have no choice".
Despite a small victory in regional disputes last December, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have been pressured to maintain the victory this year, with many prominent asylum and imprisonment officials awaiting a debate over their role in organizing the campaign and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old activist who was photographed supporting the police with her phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians from both sides.
"It is more powerful", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan state leaders who has been incarcerated since last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to counter the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen in Spain's consciousness".
Londonderry: Men arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was reportedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The crash occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. local time.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates were damaged by the building itself.
A car may have been hit by a spear.
Menga's defeat scored Livingston 1-0 to the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won the match.
Premier League promotion side Livingston surprised Rangers with a second 18-game defeat to Steven Gerrard as Ibrox coach.
Dolly Menga's score made a difference when Gary Holt's side came in second to Hibernian.
Gerrard's side remained undefeated at the home court of the Champions League this season and will face the league's top team, Hearts, who are eight points behind them, on Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has gone on to add to their league unbeaten streak of six games, with their head coach Holt expected to lose since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance to beat the weak team he had visited.
Holt's team should be in the lead before winning, while his toughness is causing all the problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass the guards but the ball passed through the front of the frame and Alan Lithgow was able to throw his ball out after a slug to hit the ball that was caused by Craig Halkett's neck.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could challenge their visitors to the protest ball.
In this way the necessary target was found.
Rangers were bowled out for Livingston as the opening batsman, Declan Gallagher and Robinson shared a method of finding out how Menga scored, who was the physical touchdown in the middle of the match.
At this level, the Rangers were very special to the ball but found that the back wall of the team they visited was unbroken and the player, Liam Kelly, had not taken any big balls,
The game continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos hit the ball and Kelly returned.
Scott Pittman's ball was taken by Rangers' forward Allan McGregor and Lithgow's upside down after another safety ball by Livingston.
The forward-throwing shots continued to appear on the Livingston team's website but were kept to a point where they were not able to reach the bench, with the claim that there were at least two penalties to be imposed, after Halkett made a mistake against Glenn Middleton who replaced and the handball, both of which were not imposed.
Critics say Livingston's performance was "extraordinary"
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A remarkable performance was a successful game for Livingston.
They certainly did well, continuing to play at their best as the game progressed.
Their playing and individual skills have changed little since their return to the majors, but Holt received enough points to put the team in the starting lineup since he arrived.
He has a lot of good players.
Captain Halkett played well, putting the rebounders in line, while Menga caught Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall through the game.
Rangers did not do much on the field.
They've always played well since they started training with Gerrard, but now they've done nothing special.
The final ball failed to reach the goal, only once they were hit by a pitch, but this led to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the league table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Kolonye
On Saturday, some would laugh and be sad (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's unannounced visit to Germany, which was to reconnect with NATO's military aid organization.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's admission to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Kolonye to open a new large mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turks outside Turkey.
Police said security reasons prevented 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many of his supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters protested against Erdogan; most of them Kurds who raised their voices against Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests resulted in a confrontation that expressed a hostile attitude towards the visitor, who was considered a tyrant by some German Turks and a tyrant by others.
Deptford Road Accident: A wheelchair user died in a car crash
The driver died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the city around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff came to his aid, but the driver died at the scene.
Last month, another vehicle was hit by an unidentified vehicle on Childers Road, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The street police said that the police would work to identify the man and notify his brothers.
The road was closed and buses and motorcyclists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers wounded in clashes
The prison director announced that six prison guards were injured in clashes in the heavily guarded men's prison.
The fighting began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 British time on Sunday and continues.
The Tornado officers were recruited to deal with the attack, which involved eight prisoners and held them in one cell.
The officers were evacuated due to the fighting with minor facial injuries.
"Specialised guards were brought in to deal with the ongoing fighting at HMP Long Lartin", said a prison spokesman.
Six prison guards were wounded.
We do not tolerate fighting in our prisons and we have made it clear that the perpetrators will be turned over to the police and their prison term may be extended".
HMP Long Lartin Prison is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the nation's most notorious criminals.
In June, it was reported that the investigative director was hospitalized for being abused by the prisoner.
And in October last year, the officers responsible for the protest were called to face the violent prison clashes where workers were beaten with billiards balls.
The northern part of the rapidly developing Rose is a concern for Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City due to rapid flooding (Food-intensive areas that can benefit from this)
It is rare for tropical storms to hit Arizona, but it is likely early next week when the remaining force of the Rosa Tropic of Capricorn reached the southwestern desert, causing rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, the tropical areas of eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the indirect route to Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving at the rain-induced Monday house.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported that "ten tropical storms have caused tropical storms or hurricanes to form over 200 miles (320 km) in Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was the largest storm to strike from the AZ border, 40 miles (64 km) away".
The National Weather Service has developed a model for rainfall from 5 to 10 cm, possibly up to 15 cm, in the Mogollon Rim region of Arizona.
Other parts of the Southwest Desert include the central Rockies and the Great Basin and can receive rainfall of 2 to 5 cm, and possibly up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of rapid flooding, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing after the area is hit by a drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of these rains may be beneficial in the southwestern part of the desert.
Weather.com reports that according to the National Institute on Drought, more than 40 percent of Arizona is at least heavily submerged, the highest level".
First, the northern extension of Rosa leads to the land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which still has strong winds on Sundays with maximum sustained winds of 135 miles per hour (620 km/h) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, is moving north at 20 miles per hour.
The wind is coming into contact with the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and slowing down.
So you are expected to land in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Heavy rains in parts of Mexico can cause severe flooding.
"All rainfall can produce up to 7 to 15 cm of water from Baja California to northeastern Sonora, where up to 25 cm of rainfall is possible", says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning during the summer of the tropical storm, which will continue its route through Arizona to southern Utah during the high hours of Tuesday night.
"The primary concerns for the northern Rosa or its associated winds are the heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern Desert", the National Weather Service said.
The rain is expected to bring about a rapid flood that could kill human lives, disintegrate the remains into the desert, and cause erosion in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four suspects arrested in an attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with metal wounds in Somerset.
The teen was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 am UK on Saturday.
She was taken to the hospital where she continued to be treated but was "not ill".
Police say one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have a cell phone that has recorded the incident to come forward and report it.
Trump says Kavanaugh "encountered the anger and brutality of the Democratic Party
"Electing Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the violent and destructive policies of the Democratic Party", Trump said in his speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "consistent with the anger and brutality" of the Democratic Party throughout his term.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress strongly and emotionally denying the allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies in court against the charges.
On Saturday, the President said, "Americans saw Kavanaugh's talent, beauty and enthusiasm" on that day.
"The nomination to convict Justice Kavanaugh is an election to validate many of the achievements of the greatest legal scholar of our time, a judge who has done extraordinary public service", he told a crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president directly mentioned Kavanaugh's campaign when he spoke about the importance of a Republican majority in the midterm elections.
"There are five weeks left until some of the most important elections of our time.
I am not a preacher, but I am a preacher".
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the big guys".
Trump said Democrats have a plan to "strike back and ban activities".
A Republican Party official told CNN that the first major step in the election is for the Senate to approve Kavanaugh's nomination, which will be held no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people died in the earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people were killed, mostly by a coastal storm, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, more than a hundred people gathered for a beach-side performance in the city of Palu when a 18 foot [6.5 m] storm hit the beach in the evening, killing many people and destroying everything you could find along the way.
A tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Disaster Management Board (BNPB), said in an interview in Jakarta: "As the tsunami crisis escalated yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the coast and did not run away and died".
"The tsunami did not come empty, it came with cars, bicycles, water, and everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami reached the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
He says that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people evacuated from the scene of the epidemic were taken to 24 camps in Palos.
Images taken by the plane released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges destroyed and other properties were flooded.
On the Sabbath, a small earthquake followed a major one, and it continued to ravage coastal towns.
Various earthquakes have been heard in areas with a population of about 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Institute for Technology and Applied Testing (BPPT) reported that the earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The report goes on to say that due to the nature of the city, the area around the sea could increase the severity of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "major" and said thousands of homes, clinics, shops and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding to 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be as high as 300 km (190 mi) offshore north of Palu, in the Donggala region, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said that receiving and transmitting information from Donggala was "deeply compromised to the point where no information could be transmitted".
The Red Cross says that the area has a population of 300,000", adding that its staff and volunteers will be moving to affected areas.
"It's already dangerous, but it can be worse", he says.
On Saturday, the company said it was under heavy criticism for not providing any reports of the tsunami that hit Palu, but officials said the storm came as they began warning the public.
In a photo taken by a non-professional posted on the international community, a man on the roof of a building is shown shouting warning people that a tsunami is coming on people on the street below him.
Within minutes, the water level hit the shore, driving the building and the car.
Reuters was unable to confirm the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a lack of fire in the reception and delivery area in Palu, leaving authorities with difficulty coordinating relief efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with relief from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, with evacuation of people from the disaster area in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been extended to provide relief and remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the disaster area of Palu.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It is terrible.
Mr. Doseba said that when World Vision staff arrived in Palu from Donggala, where workers had stayed in Tarpaulin's rooms to set up their office in the yard, they passed through a disaster area and reached the gacea.
"They told me that they saw many damaged buildings".
It is terrible.
Although aid groups have begun relief efforts, some complain that highly experienced foreign aid workers would be barred from traveling to Palos.
Under the Indonesian Financial Regulations, equipment and personnel from outside the country may be delayed in the event of a declared national disaster.
It would not be.
"It is still a regional epidemic", said a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says no, 'It's a national epidemic,' we can open up international but critical assistance that is available".
As the second night arrived in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing were confident that their loved ones would miraculously be rescued from the disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy was released from the barn.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was trapped in the debris of a house for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team, had trained two missing athletes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that the others who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As the head coach of the underwater sport, I have my own special emotions", he says.
Mr Gendon said that, hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse among the underwater skiers, he had sent a frequent WhatsApp message to competitors from Palu, who were attending a beach-side event.
Only his message, which proved to be sent but not read.
"I think the message is unread".
Thieves stole $26,750 while it was removed from an ATM machine in Newport, Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was withdrawing money from an ATM in Newport, Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was planning to withdraw money from the ATM in the theater, and to prepare to give cash to the auction, according to an official report by the investigator Dennis McCarthy.
While she was busy, another man "came from behind Brink's servant" and stole his purse with money to pay.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to reports, but the police did not specify the exact number of people involved in the theft.
Anyone with information about the identity of these individuals can call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: A rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is about to change his name to Ye.
On Saturday, announcing the changes on Twitter, he said: "I know officially that my name is Kanye West".
West, 41, has recently given himself the nickname of His and the fictional name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes came before she appeared on Saturday Night Live, where she is set to release her album Yandhi.
The host said she replaced the singer Ariana Grande in an interview where she said she was not losing "for emotional reasons".
Even as a nickname for his professional use, West once said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
Earlier this year, Wese said in a talk show on his radio show Big Boy that he "believes 'he' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible means 'you (you) ".
"So I am you, I am us, we are.
It comes from Kanye, which means one, and that is Him; which represents the good, the bad, the confusing, each.
The album reflects the image of who we are".
He is one of the famous painters who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, JAY-Z, also spelled the name in bold or capital letters.
President of Mexico AMLO has vowed not to use a military that is resistant to the dictatorship.
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force to fight the dictatorship as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student-led uprising.
Lopez Obrador, at the Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, assured that he "will never use the military to silence Mexicans".
Military shots were fired at peaceful protesters at the palace on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people during the growing student protests in Central America.
Lopez Obrador assured that the youth of the Mexican community would be supported by financial support for students and the opening of several state universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead to young people becoming involved in criminal gangs.
The United States must double the amount of money spent on artificial intelligence.
While China is doing more work on artificial intelligence, the United States needs to double its research spending on this field, according to AI entrepreneur and entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These ideas came after many parts of the US government had a positive impact on artificial intelligence; although the US generally has no known policy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: To become the No. 1 innovator in artificial intelligence by 2030.
Lee says: "Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, because other countries are still far behind the US and we are looking at ways to achieve greater AI research".
Doubling the funding for the grant could double the chances of unreachable outreach for major intellectual property projects in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in China's leading artificial intelligence company, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he developed a more intelligent artificial intelligence than the American top-ranked player Othello, who later became CEO of Microsoft's research division and head of Google's Chinese division.
Lee has endorsed US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and was asked when the next competition will be held to help identify future scientists.
Lee says that American researchers often go to great lengths to win government funding.
"China would not be ruling the skilled teachers, but the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent university scientists to work on AI projects over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could help America strengthen its power in artificial intelligence.
"I think that permanent residency in the United States, known as a green card, should be granted immediately to those with a Master's degree in Natural Sciences".
The Chinese government's National Council issued a Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in the Next Generation in July 2017.
Lee says that the Chinese Science Foundation sponsors academia in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund American researchers, but educational activities have a lower value in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Intelligence Agency, which means improved interactions between industry and academia and the US President announced the establishment of a Special Intelligence Oversight Committee.
And this month DARPA announced that it will invest $2 billion in the AI Next project.
And as for the NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers have called for the establishment of a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security, which has been stalled for months.
Macedonians voted unanimously to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted unanimously to change the name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict between Greece and Greece that has failed to apply for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbour as its own province and has suspended its application to join NATO and the European Union.
The two governments agreed in June to establish a new name, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change could undermine the identity of the Macedonian Salivic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum and the consolidation of the campaign has created confusion as to whether the few possible voters will reach 50 percent of the required votes to make the referendum worthwhile.
The question in the accompanying text reads: "Do you accept our membership in the NATO Military Relief Society and the European Union under the terms of our agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a cost to pay to keep the EU and NATO in force for Macedonia, one of the countries that broke away from the former Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje, said: "I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia; to live freely in the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us".
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will respect the outcome of the election for a decision to be made.
The change of name requires the approval of two thirds of the members of the Legislature.
The National Election Commission said no emergency was declared until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because my children, where we have to live, is in Europe", said Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted to change the name of the country to Macedonia, which would open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and unfolding a chair in front of the tents set up by the protesters.
"We need to go to NATO and the European Union, but we want to enter with confidence, not through the yard", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor nation, but we are honored.
If they don't want to treat us like Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and move to the EU-Asia".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO members are bringing a significant investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 percent.
After voting, Zaev said: "I believe that most people will vote well because more than 80 percent of our people want to join the European Union and NATO".
He said that "yes" should be "a determination of our future".
A poll conducted on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters were likely to vote for the parliament, a figure that was never required for voting approval.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To pass the referendum, a vote of up to 50 percent would be needed to add one vote.
If not achieved, the coup would be seen as a challenge to the policy of Western supporters since taking power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player who scored a goal against all the Brighton players
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling replayed Brighton's back-to-back goals in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero performed in what seemed to be the simplest way when he scored the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given the ball in the middle of the field to trade the ball early.
He ran between three back-to-back players for Brighton before running away.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four grass ball players.
He cheers for a player who closes one before running and leaves many others on the side of the Brighton shirt line.
He then handes the ball to his left and hands it to Sterling.
The English defender used his first ball to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and hit him to the right of the centre.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Age is suffering from leg problems".
"We said we could play for 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky to have him score a goal in that period".
But it was Sterling who gave the blue-collared team their first chance at winning the English Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero was given the ball which had been placed on the Brighton shirt's official website for the match.
He then sends the best ball to Leroy Sane in the left half.
Sane pauses a little before throwing it forward for Sterling to reach the point where he threw it on the other side of the pot.
The high blue-collared team batsman hit the ball into the net before passing the ball back into the net.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the first-ever European team competition at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants the unnamed team to play the Rockies.
While the Nationals were promoted to the playoffs, there was no strong reason to force the start of another tournament.
But Scherzer, a longtime competitor, believes he will be on the field on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, but in the offseason he's playing for the Rockies, which is more than a one-game win for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies narrowly missed the playoffs with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but they still want to win their first division title.
"While we're not playing anything, we can at least get to the stadium we know is here in Denver where a lot of people and other teams will be playing at the highest level of any sporting event this year.
Why don't I want to play the game?"
The Nationals are set to announce the first game on Sunday, but it has been reported that they will allow Scherzer to play in the game.
Scherzer, who will be entering his 34th game, left his usual position on Thursday but will return to his usual position on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The President addressed the issue of his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he discussed the importance of a Republican majority in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is going to be in danger in November.
Five weeks remain until some of the most important elections of our time.
"This is a very important thing, I am not campaigning but I am campaigning really and that is why I will never fight for the top candidates".
Trump continued: "You see this very bad, bad but democratically-favorite group, you see what's happening right now.
And they decided to restore their strength by any means possible, to see their wickedness, their wickedness.
They do not care who they are, and who they must work hard to get their strength and control, and what they want and control, we will not give them".
Democrats have a "constraint and prohibition" policy.
"And you see", he says of the Democrats, "that for the past four days they have been angry, cruel, wicked, and unfaithful".
She spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, who was immediately roused by the crowd.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you ever published a document?
Uh, uh, what is it?
No, uh, no, just a little; that was the most vicious kind of vicious talk I've ever seen".
The enthusiasm of the workers is not characterized by a diversity of ideas.
It is becoming impatient with those who speak their minds
When local Momentum activists voted against me, it was a surprise.
In short, I am the most recent member of the Labour Party who was told I was not welcome to express my opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was also treated in this way because she was a clear anti-Semite.
For me, the protest was a criticism because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policies includes the responsibility for people's actions, national security, Europe, to a degree that is a loss of respect for issues that Jeremy did not agree with his predecessors.
A statement from the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said: "We want the meeting to be timely and productive".
For almost eight years as a Labour Party MP, the GC meeting on Friday night was a success.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings are not held and the political agreement "of love and kindness" was forgotten before the day began.
It has become increasingly clear that the diversity of views is intolerable within the Labour Party and that each opinion must be decided whether it is approved by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when members of the same party who I thought had a political stance began to expect me to take a different direction and focus my thoughts on something else that I should not accept; whether it be national security or a single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly; and I don't need to say anything, I am followed by a massive campaign to get me fired from socialist politics, telling me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that is not my experience.
Yes, I know I'm lucky to be more than my peers because my opinions are political.
I am deeply impressed by the professionalism and dedication of my colleagues who are sexually assaulted or colored every day but do not give up.
One dismal feature of this political landscape is the level of exposure where it is considered normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should be tolerant.
The fact is that we are not all of the same opinion and the act of voting or accusing someone of being "trusted" to the same party laws prevents the party from growing.
I have been given many counsels over the past two years to keep my head down, not to say too much, so that "I will be fine".
But that did not lead to my political career.
32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a freshman, and due to the Thatcher government's failure to give up all the knowledge that was given in schools, I sought ways to better protect public services for those who needed it most; whether I was working as a consultant to the central government or a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my politics, including during the recent election.
No one in Nottingham East has ever been confused by my politics and even where we disagree with the current administration.
For those who took part in Friday's action, what I can say is that as the country moves towards a Brexit withdrawal from the European Union that will affect households, businesses and public services, I don't feel there is any desire to compromise my integrity to the leader of the Labour Party.
I'm actually not sending a message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents in my area, whether Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threats to fire me or political expectations will prevent me from doing much of what I believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr before defeat to the top
Two goals scored in a losing attempt were about to change the outcome of the match, but Ayr was certainly worth winning this spectacular match, which could be called the Tennent Day match.
They now lead the league, the only undefeated team out of ten.
Then it turned out to be a strong defensive team, and even a lucky one, which gave the host team and its coach Peter Murchie reason to rejoice.
"We have been tested in the game so far and we have not lost, so I should be happy".
"Congratulations Ayr, who brought us the best of luck", says Robyn Christie of Melrose.
The shot by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, however, a yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued by the Warriors to play for the national team, was given by Melrose to go into the team with Jason Baggot attempting to hit a goal.
Climo added a penalty kick to Ayr's goal, and before that, just before the end of the first half, he scored a solo goal and it was Ayr's 17-5 in the first half.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's ball was hit by Baggot, cutting the lead by five points.
With the delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was knocked out of the field, the game was resumed, with Ayr continuing to approach the goal from Stafford McDowall, which was scored by Climo.
Ayr's vice-captain Blair Macpherson was awarded a yellow card and Melrose sent another senior goalkeeper to Bruce Colvine after a shady game.
The team he had saved paid for the loss, while Struan Hutchinson had been awarded a yellow card for scoring Climo without the ball, just behind the line of the home court, MacPherson scored the ball backwards to beat Ayr.
Climo scored the same goal as he did in the rebounding, after which Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong from the bench and sent the ball to sideman Gregor Henry in the fifth try to the receiving team.
Still Game player prepares for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game player Ford Kieran appears to be ready to go to the reception after he finds out he has been invited by a licensed manager of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he also co-wrote and co-stars with fellow long-time actor Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth film in the series will be the sequel to the film and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the information provided in the form of a directory, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress declined to comment on the news, although the Scottish Sun's source was a sign that Kiernan wanted to be included in Glasgow's "growing restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': a landlocked country in Bolivia hopes to reopen the Pacific Ocean
The Maritime Safety Authority is a professional maritime authority based in La Paz.
Government buildings have a blue elevated roof.
The Titicaca Marine Corps from the Amazon has a common goal: "We have the right to the sea.
We take it as a responsibility".
Across the landlocked country of Bolivia, this day commemorates the defeat of the Chilean-Bolivian coastal war in a bloody 19th-century conflict; the longing for a second Pacific cruise is high.
This is perhaps the most optimistic situation in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: "Bolivia is strong, the party is united and calm and hopes for a positive decision".
Bolivians will consider the International Court of Justice's ruling on the country's territorial disputes, believing that the Lahe court will find the Bolivian claim justified; after decades of fruitless negotiations, Shiri was forced to negotiate a way to grant Bolivia access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a talented and patriotic Bolivian president, is running for re-election next year; he also has strong confidence that Monday's decision will be successful.
"We are just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean", he swore in late August.
But some reviewers believe that the court will not always make a decision in favor of Bolivia and will make little change.
The United Nations Office in the Netherlands has no authority to grant Shiri territory and says it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
Paz Zárate, an expert in international law from Chile, says: The ICJ's decision came just six months after the trial concluded that the complaint was "not complicated".
To further reflect Bolivia's aspirations, the past four years may have set back the achievements.
"The issue of maritime touch is a matter for the Bolivian government", Zárate said.
He says that the words intended to end the Morales war had a positive effect on the remaining hunters.
Bolivia and Chile have maintained a relationship, but it will be very difficult to continue to communicate after this.
Both countries have not sentenced ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in Lahe, rejected the suggestion that the court's speedy decision was unnecessary.
On Monday, it will give Bolivia "an unusual opportunity to establish a new relationship with Shiri" and an opportunity to "end a 139-year-old conflict and both sides will benefit from it".
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Central America's most popular presidents, would use the issue of sea action for political gain.
"Bolivia will never again withdraw its right to operate in the Pacific Ocean".
"This decision is an opportunity to see if we should forget the past".
North Korea says a nuclear weapons ban will not be lifted until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop producing nuclear weapons unless it trusts Washington.
Ri said this on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called for the UN to implement the agreement reached at the Singapore summit between conflicting leaders.
The remarks came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of resuming talks on the seemingly halted nuclear weapons after three months of talks in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said "it is not possible" to continue imposing sanctions and the United States continues to refuse to publicly end the war with Korea, which does not place North Korea at its knees.
Washington is hesitant to issue a statement unless the Pyongyang government takes the first step toward stopping the development of nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But Pyongyang has been widely criticized for insisting on ceasing to produce nuclear weapons because the country sees it as the only way to secure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show shows new clothes on the highways near you.
If you want to increase your own hats or protect yourself from the sun, do not go far.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne threw a huge hat at her in the SS19 fashion group on the street where the fashion launched a fashion week in Paris.
The big-collar hats were featured on Instagram this summer and the designers showed off their amazing creations at a fashion show.
The unique Valentino hat is beige with a wings-like groove that extends forward to the head.
Other accompanied by larger clothing include otameron-like jewelry, a high-heeled hat and pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a group of amazing masks and as Halloween approaches.
Most of the colored masks are designed to be lip-synched by Hannibal Lecter rather than specifically designed.
One of the masks was made of a similar material to the one worn to sink under the sea with a heavy blow and a straw, while the other looked like ice cream.
And if you keep talking about great fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts expect these giant cartoons to reach the major roads near you.
The large hats will resemble 'La Bomba', a 60-cm-thick, hard-wearing hat worn by celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The famous brand of the world-famous superhero hat has once again demonstrated its achievements at a fashion show, a bag made of thick grass to carry a large sand tank with a swimsuit-wearing model on display.
The bag made of the first-ever burnt orange raffia leaves, made from the leaves of the tree and topped with a white leather cap, is a reference to the Jacquemus clothing line La Riviera SS19 at the Paris Fashion Week.
A celebrity like Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect the big hats and sandbags to hit the highways this summer; while the designer of the garments has made a big change to the point where the oversized garments are ignored.'
John Edward: Linguistics is important to the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue to lead the way in education and continued in 2018 with further positive test results, further emphasizing the individual and overall achievements of students in sport, the arts, music and other community-related activities.
Of approximately 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the highest level of quality services for both pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to better prepare their students for higher education, career choice and participation in the global community.
As the Department of Education can develop and implement a student-friendly curriculum, we are seeing new languages becoming increasingly popular and a subject of choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to someone in their language, what you're saying goes to their mind.
When you speak to him in his own language, your words reach his heart".
These are powerful words that remind us that we must not only speak English if we want to have a positive relationship with people from other countries.
From the results of the most recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the list where they have been the most frequently failed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying abroad have achieved their highest A grade.
Data collected by the SCIS board from 74 schools in the board showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A in middle school, while 72 percent of students achieved an A in German, 69 percent of students in French and 63 percent of students in Spanish.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages, which are essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, like your chosen subject, are now taken up by other STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects of your choice in private or non-public school curricula.
A 2014 UK Commission on Employment and Learning survey found that 17 per cent of the reasons why users are struggling to find job applicants were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are thus a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
While many jobs require language, this knowledge is essential in a city-built world.
Regardless of what profession he or she has been involved in, learning a second language has the potential to bring about a lifelong knowledge of the language.
Being able to communicate directly with other people from foreign countries immediately makes the person who knows more than others competitive in the market.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent are not able to speak a foreign language well enough to communicate, while French is the only language spoken by more than a tenth of the population, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Multilingualism - especially in developing countries - gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the language of instruction.
Most schools will focus on current languages, while others will teach languages considered to be of importance in the UK for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there are always languages you choose in independent schools where teachers are experts in the subject.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to educating children in a way that prepares them and gives them the knowledge they need to achieve their goals, whatever the future may bring.
It cannot be denied that today, in international trade, languages remain a key factor for the future of the country, and therefore must also be reflected in education.
Yes, modern languages should be considered as "knowledge that enables international communication.
Independent schools continue to offer these options, options and accessibility to Scottish youth.
The good news is that we must do so.
John Edward is the Executive Director of the Independent Schools Commission for Scotland
On Sunday, LeBron is going to play his first game for the Lakers in San Diego.
The wait is almost over as fans look forward to LeBron James making his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he would play was not confirmed.
"It will be over 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will play countless minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule of about six games.
"I don't need to play pre-season games at this level of my career to prepare myself", he said.
When Trump's campaign in West Virginia, on the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump resigned during a storm tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five campaigns scheduled for next week, including a parade through prominent locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
While a confirmation vote was not held on the nomination for the position of President of the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking help for the upcoming midterm elections since Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
When will Trump's campaign in West Virginia be tonight and how will it be viewed online?
Trump's campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia online on the link to the second online campaign on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's hearing on the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been heightened by allegations of sexual misconduct that the expected Senate vote to approve him was postponed as the FBI is investigating.
But the main focus of this campaign is to help the Republicans withstand the November general election to keep it strong.
Thus, presidential campaign officials said that the five campaigns will be held next week to "empower volunteers and activists as Republicans try to maintain and increase their Senate and House majority", according to a Reuters report.
A Trump campaign spokesman wanted Reuters to report: "Congress control is a key element of his plan so that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we go at a time of high campaign activity".
The campaign, which is scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, will attract activists from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be reported by Pittsburgh newspapers", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will be visiting West Virginia for the second time last month, a state that won the election by more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for West Virginia Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in voting.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters: "It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is coming to help him increase his vote".
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows their resilience to maintain their confidence in Sunday's games
After the Games, a Saturday afternoon golf tournament may have been the Ryder Cup.
Fortunately, a competitive idea was introduced but it is one of the most trusted and more reliable competitors.
Where, then, is the power?
"They led by six points and now they're four, so I'm sure we're going to show some strength", said Jordan Spieth, who walked in the afternoon.
Of course, Europe is lucky, with four points ahead with twelve more games to play.
Americans, Spieth says, feel that they have high winds blowing their boats and have a lot of enthusiasm, at least not in the case of Spieth and Justin Thomas playing all day and scoring three out of four points each.
Spieth has won a lot from the pitch and the example.
Those who would have enjoyed the crowd with the loudest noise were more when he hit the ball and fell into the hole, scoring the key points to the game as he and Thomas were two points behind two games later.
The ball that led to a 15 game win was also played with a cheerful shout, a way to convince him that he believed the US team was missing.
"You have to get to the roots and focus on your own game", Spieth says.
That's what each of these players has left.
18 pitches to put the ball in.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, both of whom are Ryder Cup starters.
European standards are in place but he is likely to win four out of four games without a draw.
"Moliwood" are the only two who failed to hit the ball on Saturday afternoon, but they have refused to pitch the ball in the hole on Saturday morning, Friday evening and in the second half of the game to hit the ball in the eighteen holes on Friday morning.
The game and the way their strengths were moving was to move on and off the team that had already established itself as the players to face on Sunday and there may be more famous players to bring Europe to victory at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Fortunately, both can be done in different ways.
Talking about European victory would be too early.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson worked for Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The two-to-nine balls in the game allowed the Spanish and Swedes to hit the ball but never the ball into the pitch.
On Sundays, no one is there to help you get the ball out of your hole.
Four-ball golf is interesting to watch closely due to the interaction between the players involved in the game, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the possibility that the steps can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has performed well as a team so far and led by enough points on the final day but the four-player series has also shown the strength of the US team in the points defense; in particular, for the disputed governments.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good chance on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a four-ball match on Saturday in which it leads with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The best players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the game by winning the Tiger Woods Challenge twice to become the league's top four-time league champion.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who were the defending champions, defeated by Hazeltine two years later, outperformed the American side who were not performing well in the morning four-ball match, winning 3-1.
The U.S. team defended their title in four games, winning two games, but it did not prevent them from losing.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points in Sunday's 12-game sweep to retain the title.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to score four consecutive points while he and Molinari were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a successful week as they were the only two players to score four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
His fourth-round defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed led to a successful victory over Woods, who was not as good as the star Bryson Dechambeau, who scored more than 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed a high level of performance but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the four-point conversion and four-seven-player rounds.
Justin Rose, who did not play in the morning four-ball match, was replaced by his teammate Henrik Stenson in the fourth round when they lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were the third-ranked team in the world.
Europe did not play as well as usual, with a happy day of storms coming from the southwest of Paris.
Three major champions, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, were named the American Open for the second time on Saturday.
They beat 2&1 to beat Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-run home run and came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fourth after losing the first two holes.
The Ryder Cup has twice been the most successful four-point loss to a team in a single-player match, although Furyk's champions need only a draw to retain the title.
After being a good couple for two days, but then on Sunday they will play a game of revenge even if it will be too much.
North Korea says there is no "way" to detonate a country without hope
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions would increase distrust of the United States and that there was no way a country could abandon its nuclear program in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the national level officials at the Annual General Meeting that "appropriate measures have been taken" over the past year, such as halting nuclear testing, demolition of nuclear testing sites and ensuring no further development of nuclear bombs and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see the proper response from the United States".
"There is no confidence in the United States that there will be confidence in our national security and if so, there is no way we can as a country stop producing nuclear weapons".
While Ri echoed North Korea's usual claims about Washington's willingness to disarm as it is in a "stage" of nuclear disarmament where North Korea can control the price as it steps in, his comments seem valid even though he never denied that the Pyongyang government can disarm as it has done before.
Ri followed the remarks of both presidents Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the incumbent US president and the North Korean president in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work to "stop the nuclear test of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea wanted a solution to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States insisted that Pyongyang should first stop developing nuclear weapons.
Washington has refused to accept a reduction in the stringent international sanctions it has imposed on North Korea.
"The United States continues to insist that 'we first stop the development of nuclear weapons' and increase the level of sanctions imposed to achieve their goal by force, despite the refusal to 'declare an end to the war.'"
"The idea that sanctions can lead to our being put on our knees is an impossible dream for the society that ignores us.
But the problem is that the continued imposition of sanctions increases our confidence".
Ri has not made any announcements about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president reiterated at a UN summit earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months and said: "If the country were to address the issue of nuclear nonproliferation today, it would be South Korea rather than the United States, and the Korean Peninsula would not have ceased to produce nuclear weapons".
And Ri's voice was strikingly different from that of last year when he told the UN General Assembly that attempting to launch a Korean missile into the US was possible after "Mr. President", Trump called Kim a "suicide bomber".
This year at the UN summit, Trump, who last year threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his determination to take a ceasefire step, but said that much still needed to be done and sanctions were maintained until North Korea stopped bombing.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time to do so, saying, "If it takes two, three, or three months; it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are arguing with the UN Security Council that it should reward Pyongyang's government for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday: "The tightening of the Security Council sanctions must continue with a strong and unrelenting focus until it is proven that the nuclear bombs have been fully, safely and thoroughly removed".
The Security Council has held no further proceedings to extend sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the possibility of supporting the Pyongyang government in its nuclear and missile development plans.
Pompeo met Ri at a sideline meeting during the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit to the country has been unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that a step had been taken, where hours later North Korea reiterated his claim, declaring that "the demands are like a gang of bandits".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon that it would demolish the plant and nuclear reactors this month if the United States "takes similar action".
He said Kim told him that "similar measures" he wanted to be taken were to ensure security under Trump's Singapore deal and to continue to rebuild relations with the Washington government.
Harvard students are given a full-time rest lesson.
A new study from Harvard University this year has given all undergraduates more sleep to combat the growing male culture of caffeine-based 'night-long' study.
A university worker has found that top-ranked students at a university often lack basic information about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has organized a study, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He suggested starting a lesson after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on behavior.
'At the end of the conversation, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I being told this now, I'm in my final year of college?'
She says that no one has ever told her the importance of sleep, which surprised me,' she told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which was first offered, explains to students the key elements of sleep that help students and athletes behave well and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health services, said the university chose to introduce the course after students had not slept for a week.
The hour-long class includes a variety of communication assignments.
In one section there is a picture of the bedroom, where students tap on coffee cups, dresses, sports shoes and books and are told the effects of caffeine and light on exercise and the importance of having good sleep habits on time.
In another study, participants were told how prolonged insomnia may increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression and cancer.
The university map, with information graphics, encourages the students to reflect on their routine.
'We know that they will not change the behavior of students immediately.
Professor Czeisler: But we believe they have a right to know; just as you have a right to know the health effects of your choice to smoke.'
There is still a tendency to commit to 'night' learning, he added, adding that modern technology and increasing shadow among students who say that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making enough, healthy sleep a priority should be a 'secret weapon' for students against stress, anxiety and stress; and avoiding weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a starvation mode, which causes it to starve.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of health and physical fitness, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, having completed his coursework last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and led him to want to be taught at a university.
He believes that the next step is to require graduate students to complete certain programs before entering employment-related institutions.
Professor Czeisler suggests that students should consider setting a bedtime and wake-up time schedule and when they are exposed to potentially harmful effects such as blue light from light bulbs and LEDs, which can cause sleep disturbances and sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal to beat Gerrard's coaches
The Rangers were again in the eye with Dolly Menga's goal being scored 1-0 away to Steven Gerrard's Livingston.
Ibrox looked set to win for the first time since their 4-1 defeat to St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as manager to keep his side behind the Ladbrokes Championship points behind Hearts.
Menga scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half where the Rangers were left unable to repay.
While the Rangers are now relegated to the sixth tier, Livingston has moved up to third and is behind Hibernian in goalscoring.
And there may be more issues ahead for Rangers after sideman Calum Spence suffered a head injury after an apparent impact from a distance.
Gerrard made eight substitute changes in his team which earned Ayr promotion to the semi-finals of the Red Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, who took 11 Livi players to score against Hearts last week and was overall pleased that his team beat their opponents throughout the game.
Rangers may be a very special team, but Livingston has produced the least of the balls they've ever seen.
They won in minutes when Menga's first ball was sent to Scott Pittman's Allan McGregor pitch but the midfielder had the chance to throw the ball out.
The ball was thrown into the goal by Keaghan Jacobs and found by goalkeeper Craig Halkett, but a back-up player named Alan Lithgow led the ball out of the goal.
The Rangers led the game but it seemed they should have more to do than be confident in their play in the quarter-finals.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly felt he should have been penalized at the 75th minute when he and Steven Lawless faced off, but the referee, Steven Thomson, refused to take into account the approach of the Colombian.
The Rangers managed only two shots into the back of the net in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not dismissed for the ball against Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's unbalanced shot.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been a result of an attack, there is no denying that they should not have scored it and followed the plan.
The Rangers also failed to recover the safety ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing to the ball passed by Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who did nothing to stop the ball being easily thrown into the center by Menga.
Gerrard made a break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, which was about to yield an immediate hit when the forward on the side was given the ball to Morelos but Kelly ran well and stopped the ball.
But Livingston continued to resist the team he had visited to play regular football, where Lithgow and Halkett were hitting long, hard balls.
Holt's side scored another goal in the final minutes but McGregor was firmly in the back of the net and prevented Jacobs from hitting the ball as Lithgow hit the ball with his head out.
The Rangers replaced Glenn Middleton who later suggested a penalty against Jacobs but was also ignored by referee Thomson.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
Even our page in the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 days later today and we ARE still alive... the day the future independenceist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring the release of chemical particles produced, which led to the development of the Geiger Counter.
The device has since been scientifically proven, and the Geiger Counter has become a standard in theater, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Husband: "What is that instrument?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, which is used to detect minerals containing toxic elements such as iranium.
If you gave me these e-cars, you could clearly understand the evolution of atoms released by the chemical particles in these gems".
Evans: "They are beginning to jump!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the metal he discovered that bears his name still exists.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "find" harmful stem cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'find' harmful stem cells and kill them
A vaccine trains the immune system to identify malignant stem cells as part of a treatment process
This process is removing the cells that help to keep the body immune from the patient and transforming them into a laboratory
They can then "search" for a normal protein found in many cancers and then re-inject it into the body.
The vaccine is currently being tested and is showing positive results for patients with various cancers.
One woman who was vaccinated, which trains the immune system to detect malignant stem cells, was able to recover from her prostate cancer after 18 months.
The technique involves removing stem cells from the patient and converting them to a laboratory to "search" for the HER2 protein found in many cancers and then replenishing the stem cells.
"The results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Berzofsky explains that HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancer", including breast, prostate, lung and large intestine cancers.
One method of removing the cells from the patient and "training" the cells against the cancer stem cells was used to treat blood cancer.
Kanye West praised Trump supporters, wearing a hat he wrote MAGA on, after appearing on SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was shouted out in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a strange song praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After singing her third song of the night, she called Ghost Town in her Make America Great cap, attacked Democrats and again declared her support for Trump.
"Too many times I talk about white people, they say, 'How can you love Trump, not make a list?'
"I mean, if I'm worried about the pandemic, I'm probably out of the U.S. a long time ago".
SNL's program began with a comedy starring the critically acclaimed actor Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee responded to Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of sexual harassment.
Despite not being reported in the press, West's quotes were posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to criticize West based on what he posted on the website.
And West regretted that viewers had said too many words behind the stage on the hat he was wearing.
"I was chased behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go on stage wearing that hat'
They have been following me!
"They said I was not standing", according to the Washington Examiner.
"You want to see that I'm not standing?" West continues, "and wear a chaperone, because that means you don't tell me what to do.
Try to love each other".
His remarks led to at least two shouts from the audience on the SNL show and the audience seemed embarrassed, as reported by Variety, where one person told the newspaper: "The entire studio has fallen into disarray".
West was last seen as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, where her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West released many of the songs on his album I Love it, in which he wore a Perrier cap.
West was supported by former TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most enthusiastic people: You're OK with the BIG GROUP".
But reporter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West is "really and truly a showcase and a great show".
"But I have chosen NOT to pay the salary (buy his music or clothes to promote his 'art') in the hope that he is receiving and spreading ideas that are damaging to the people of my community.
He freed himself.
He continues: "We too have been freed.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is now "formerly known as Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed others to do so with Bairmo Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, once used the name Snoop Lion and the recently deceased legendary Prince, changed the name to the logo and the artist was once known as Prince.
Attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has condemned the bad habits of the kibago
Kit Harington is known for playing the swordsmith Jon Snow in the fantasy-themed HBO television series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has denied discrimination based on the heroic masculine nature, saying that the play means that teens often feel they must stick to themselves to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that 'something was wrong' and wondered how he could address the issue of male immorality with the launch of the women's rights campaign known as #Me.
Kit, recently married to Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that she feels "too strong" about solving a problem.
'I feel so strong right now, I wonder, 'Is this where male misconduct comes from?'
'Do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we face today?'
Kit believes that television may have a role in the rise of male pornography due to the increasingly obscene portrayal of male pornography by actors.
He continues: 'What is a man born, and what is his disciple?
What is taught on television and what is taught on the street that makes teenagers feel that they have a part in becoming men?
I think that this is a very serious question in our times: How can we change this?
Because something is obviously wrong with our youth.'
In the interview, he also agreed that he would not be able to play the series that preceded or followed Game of Thrones when the series ends this summer, saying that he "doesn't want to fight in battle and ride horses anymore".
From November Kit will star in Sam Shepard's spin-off True West, a film production story by his brother, a thief.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting his wife, Rose, is the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones series.
He said: 'I met my wife while we were doing a series, so they gave me my future family and my new life from then on.'
Rose played Ygritte, a favorite of Kit and Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning comedy-drama series.
They were married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, according to health officials.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
A large number of new infections have been sexually transmitted infections, which is different from what was the case in the past.
The HIV virus is usually spread rapidly in some parts of China due to contaminated blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, health officials in China announced at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual HIV infection is a serious problem for homosexuals in China.
Gay sex was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against gays is on the rise.
Because the country is a conservative country, the survey estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the infections are caused by sexual misconduct in the marriage.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make AIDS vaccines available to the general public as part of a response to the crisis.
Maxine Waters denied that the report of a Republican senator by one of the staffs, denouncing "problematic lies" and "malign conspiracy"
On Saturday, US Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff posted personal information about Republican senators on the legal pages of Wikipedia.
A Democrat in Los Angeles said the measures were being ignored by negotiators who "strongly support Republicans".
Waters called it "a lie, a lie, a terrible lie".
The information reported is believed to include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information posted online on Thursday was reported by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The news came out after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Hill announces: Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address indicating the source of the data is related to Waters and has reported information to one of Waters' employees.
"These accusations are baseless and completely false", he added.
"One of my employees, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised because of fraudulent and false allegations, was not responsible for releasing this information.
These accusations are false and false".
Waters' comments promptly led to a major online scandal, including criticism from former US House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is outrageous", Fleischer said.
"It shows that he has no desire to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not refuse to let the leadership do its job.
He does not need to wonder why the accuser is accusing him.
He needs to be quiet and calm".
Fleischer was forced to compare Waters' response to the allegations to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was also accused by critics of appearing angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to remove Waters from office in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It would be hard if it were true", he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said his office had "informed the authorities and law enforcement agencies that are looking into what he says is fraud.
"We will do so in order to expose those who have done this", he continued, "and they will be held accountable for all the bad and bad acts they have done against all my servants".
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson played a weak comedian
It is now common practice to see the effect of Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, which is similar to a new English-language film and which seems likely to be a new film in the popular Johnny English series of fighting and comedy films; it was originally released in 2003 as Johnny English and then re-released in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
A comedy-drama film about a paradoxical subject that will showcase our country's potential for export?
In any case, the stuntman, disabled old actor Johnny English was granted a second chance at a second film, the title of which is most famous for being a comedy-drama for non-English speaking audiences.
He plays a secret agent who learns to play the funny way to portray the face of Clouseau, becoming as good as Mr. Bean plays in a remote setting as at the Chariots of Fire opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the character and the character of Atkinson, who had previously starred in a Barclaycard TV commercial that he may have forgotten about, leaving behind a mess.
There are two good moments in the JE release.
I loved how Johnny English approached the frog while wearing the 500-foot guard uniform of his warriors and a hard-nosed frog's hat on the tape he was wearing.
Atkinson's talent for body comedy is highly expressive, but his sense of humor seems weak and unusual in the underground, especially in the blockbuster films 007 and Mission Impossible, where the actors "know what they need" themselves playing comedy as a complement.
The humor seems to be aimed at young children rather than adults and Johnny English's unusual absurdist works are not innovative and focus on films starring Atkinson where he never utters a word as Bean.
The most widely reported news was that Britain was in grave danger.
A computer hacker infiltrates a major British spy ring and reveals the profiles of all the British spy agents working in various locations, where an actor is shown working but unfortunately assigned to play a small role named Kevin Eldon.
It was a real challenge for the arrogant and controversial Prime Minister, who was in the depths of what might be an unpopular politician: Emma Thompson had good acting where she was going to be Teresa-May but little to do.
His intelligence advisers told him that spies everywhere were being publicly posted, and that someone had to retire.
And it means no one but Johnny English, who is currently working as a teacher in a low-cost school, but who teaches off-campus courses where he teaches how to be a spy: These are great tips from English where he teaches a class at a Rock-style school about espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall where he must receive urgent instructions and reunite with his former colleague Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a barber, married to a submarine captain, who is now a non-productive Vicki Pepperdine.
So it is Batman and Robin who play the role of the protagonists in the Queen's Secret Service, meeting a tough woman working for Olga Kurylenko named Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister was trapped by a billionaire tech expert who claims he can solve the UK's computer crisis: the lucky Jason Volta, a place to drink with Jake Lacy.
English begin Bough's difficult journey of self-deception: They become waiters, run a French restaurant; they create a barrier and try to sneak into the expensive Volta cruise ship; and English tries to take matters into his own hands when he tries to use real, unobtrusive tattoos to train inside the Volta house.
All of this is discussed in the final part of the film, but as exciting and intense as it is, a children's TV show shows all of this.
It is very normal.
And this is how all the other Johnny English films are left to me: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson the opportunity to play well and showcase his talent?
Labour denies that it is considering a British plan to work four days a week but still be paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party is considering a major plan that would leave all British workers working four days a week, but being paid five days.
The party says it wants the leaders of various companies to find ways to save money through the development of artificial intelligence (AI) for employees to give them an extra day off.
It may leave employees enjoying a three-day weekend, but they are paid their usual salary.
The report said the idea was "appropriate" for the political economy and intended to change the situation to the satisfaction of the country's workers.
The shift is carried out four days a week with the support of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to encourage workers to be more productive of the economic changes.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'A strategic review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
'It is not a one-day event but working four days a week is a desirable way to align the dynamic processes of economically in the interests of workers and the dynamic strategies of industry as a whole.'
The Labour Party may not have been the first to support the idea, as the environmental party has pledged to introduce four-day work week in the wider campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at present this desire is not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
"Working four days a week is not a party strategy and is not thought of as a passion", said a Labour Party spokesman.
Shansoriye's deputy, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party's meeting last week to express his focus on the socialist economic transformation.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to recover the energy that was being taken away from "the faceless leadership" and "the cry of the water, gas and electric companies.
The proposed extension also suggests that the partners in the water supply companies may not support the entire plan as a whole if the workers' government 'cut costs' based on the wrong actions it has seen taking place.
He also agreed to plan to put employees on the Board of Directors and set up an employee benefit fund called Inclusive Ownership Funds which will provide 10 percent of the shares in employee-owned companies, with each expected to receive a share of profits of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told the "60 Minutes" interview whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the alleged crimes of Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final election for President of the Supreme Court by a week, and raised the question of whether the department's findings could lead to a repeal of Republican Senate support.
In a conversation that broke out on Sunday, a "60 Minutes" anchor, Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could make any discoveries that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more comfortable than his fellow South Carolina resident.
"That's exactly what it is", Kennedy said.
"I spoke about going to court, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after this, and said, What is this that he has done?
He stood firm, determined, and accurately described what had happened".
However, Graham's vote seemed to have been confirmed.
"I have made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and I want to take action to dismiss the charges against him".
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has vehemently denied it", Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone speaks without control.
It's a 36-year-old allegation.
I see nothing new that can change".
Has the Global Citizen Festival even done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features celebrity musicians performing and with an exciting mission to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival brings thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to celebrate the work of such celebrity artists as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to campaign for the true goal of the festival, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that believes poverty eradication will be achieved by increasing the number of people who will fight it.
To receive a free ticket to take you to the festival (unless you wish to pay a ticket to the festival), participants must perform a variety of activities or "activities" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling or other useful ways to help launch a campaign to end poverty.
But how does Global Citizen reach its goal within 12 years of its goal?
Is the idea of paying people to attend a free concert the right way to get people to call for an action or is it another way to "click online"; people who feel they would make a real change by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen Culture has reported that it has documented nearly 19 million "activities" by its supporters, leading to a variety of goals.
It adds that these actions have helped to enable world leaders to announce policies and policies worth USD 37 billion to make a difference in the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported that it had committed 390 projects with a deficit of approximately $10 billion in donations or collection.
The group estimates that the support received so far has indirectly changed the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the initiatives are meetings with The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based business and community organisation committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which pledged to donate US$35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, sponsors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can end social inequality and make history", Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 initiatives to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Nutrition initiative, which will reach 5 million women and children who will receive nutrition assistance.
In answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, it asks: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road; sometimes it involves falling and achieving goals.
But, as the great human rights and anti-apartheid revolutions in South Africa took place before we started, we will succeed, because when we work together we are stronger.
Artists including Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's New York City concert, which will be conducted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use warships to "lock" and prevent Russian exports of force; the Secretary of Interior reports
The Washington government may "if necessary" decide to use its warships to prevent Russian gas from reaching a range of markets, including the Middle East, as announced by Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke accused Russia of interference in the Syrian war, which it has largely attended at the official invitation of the government, but as an excuse for its desire to find a new source of gas.
He is reported to have said: "I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to access the gas supply as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe".
And, according to the authorities, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our warships, to operate to open and close sea lanes if necessary, to ensure that their gas is not reaching the market".
Zinke was speaking to respondents of the action taken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the voice of gas consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, saying that the two countries are not alike.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, almost, to have energy and replace petroleum", he said, referring to Russia as a "tricky horse" where the economy relies heavily on petroleum.
The comments came after the Trump administration plans to increase the amount of gas used in European waste disposal to replace Russia, which sells gas at a lower price to Europeans.
Thus, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to lure Germany out of the "wrong" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says has made the Berlin government a "hire" to Moscow.
Moscow has continued to stress that the $11 billion project for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is expected to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is only intended as an economic project.
The Kremlin says that Washington's total rejection of the project is largely economic and is a good example of bias in market competition.
"I believe we share the view that gas cannot be a tool for a particular side of the pressure and that users should be able to choose who to handle it", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Secretary of State for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was not well received by Germany, which reaffirmed its support for the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), a leading German industrial organization, has called for the United States to avoid any approach to the EU's aggressive policies and the Berlin-Moscow agreement.
"I have a serious problem with a third country interfering with our gas supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) and recently speaking at a joint summit between Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think hard" about running for president in 2020, announced by a Massachusetts state senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she should "think hard" about running for president after the midterm elections.
In a public address at the Holyoke, Massachusetts, bar, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and rule our divided state, where women will be the leaders", she said, according to The Hill.
"After December 6, I will think seriously about running for president".
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump in a House of Representatives speech, saying that it was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy", he said.
Warren has been heavily critical of Trump and his nominee for President of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
"We really need the FBI to investigate before the election", Warren said in a Twitter post on Friday.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of voters in Warren's home district do not think he should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "potential" voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported his campaign.
The poll found strong support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his campaign and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent Democratic names have been mentioned as potential candidates for the 2020 election including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he could make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaks of Track Palin's depression in the campaign of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq before being placed on the September transfer list.
She was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
She told the campaigners of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, "My son's experience, I can relate to, is that other families are reducing the severity of the crisis and the injuries our soldiers suffer from withdrawing".
Palin described her arrest as "looking for a problem where it wasn't" and said her son and other veterans "come back separately, come back strong, come back to question whether there is honor for their fellow airmen and each soldier because of their volunteerism".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and sexual assault, threatening to report domestic violence and possession of a firearm while on drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the rejection of new asylum measures
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported the court's new ban on U.S. asylum-seeking measures for victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories issued a brief of the Friends of the Court on Friday in Washington to uphold the asylum-seekers' measures, NBC News reported.
All the names of the plaintiffs in favor of Grace v. Sessions state that the August complaint of the American Civil Liberties Unionfiled against government action was never filed.
She said that her boyfriend "even her sons were in a gang", but the US authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Government lawyers in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the largest refugee populations in the United States, as a country facing widespread crime and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence.
Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a speech on Friday that the new measures "ignore decades of state, national and international law".
"The national law requires that all claims for asylum be dealt with on the basis of personal data and that the claim has been made and that the new measures adopted are in excess of that", the court wrote in a brief statement.
The judges continued to call in the brief that immigration restrictions would be detrimental to the US economy, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide essential employment".
In June, Chief Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
In a June 11 statement on the measures, Sessions said: "Asylum is granted to those who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear of being discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion".
Refugees are not designed to reduce the severity of problems; no matter how serious the problems people face every day around the world.
Major relief efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in an urgent search for a victim
For survivors, the problems continued to worsen as the hours wore on.
"I feel very bad", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her son with a fire at a rescue camp in Palu.
"Every minute, a rescue team comes to your rescue.
Clean water is rare".
The residents who were found would return to their ruined homes, take their flooded property, and try to find what they could use.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals were damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were lying outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside as minor earthquakes were still being heard.
Tears filled his eyes as he recited the events when he heard a powerful earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and son.
"We had no time to run.
I'm so overwhelmed by the remains of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my son.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "inciting" its use of propaganda
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a daily American newspaper that praised the US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US newspaper to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump rescinded China Daily's overcharging of the Des Moines Register, Iowa's state newspaper with the highest circulation of newspapers, and later sued China for interference in the US congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempted election interference highlight what US officials told Reuters as a new step in a plan to put pressure on China by a new Washington-led administration.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now embroiled in a trade war that has escalated to the point of increasing tariffs on each country's imports.
China has also been quiet on the tax front since the beginning of the trade war, which was set to hit exporters in Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, according to experts on China-US relations.
Terry Branstad, the longtime U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing is a threat to American farmers, ranchers and businessmen.
"This has increased the pressure on non-interference and the posting of propaganda ads in our independent newspapers", Branstad wrote in a commentary in the Des Moines Register published on Sunday.
Branstad: In order to spread its influence, the Chinese government is benefiting from the US culture of free speech and freedom of the press that publishes paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register".
"In contrast, at the newspaper stores in the streets here in Beijing, you see comments from dissatisfied with the government's performance but you don't see the real picture of the diversity of ideas that the Chinese may be in a troubled economic path, given that the media is being monitored by the ruling Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the major Chinese newspapers has escaped the publicity frenzy" of his story, although he never named the paper.
Analysts would warn that Republicans would split from female voters just before midterm elections along with Kavanaugh Debacle
While many Republican leaders were waiting and would support the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of multiple sexual assaults, the investigator warned that their actions would not be well received; particularly on the women's side, during the midterm elections.
The sentiment surrounding the issue is overwhelming and many Republicans have already expressed their support for the elections to continue.
These things are irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in a news release on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that what Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona's Republican representative) announced at the last minute for the FBI to investigate will be enough to temper the anger of the angry voters.
"Women will never forget yesterday; they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the development group MoveOn, said Friday, according to a Washington, D.C. news release.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is here!" as they protested in the Senate chamber as the Republican-controlled Justice Committee chose to continue to approve Kavanaugh's administration despite the blunder of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no political affiliation, told the newspaper website: "The democratic movement and its goal are at a high level".
"People would say it's a high level, and it's true.
But it can go even higher; especially among women who were not sure who to vote for in the suburbs and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who were not fond of the president, they often did not vote".
Although Ford had not publicly testified before making a clear statement about his sexual orientation by the nominee for President, reviewers said that the situation could not be acceptable as long as the Republicans continued to seek approval.
"This has been a confusing outcome for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former executive director of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week in a news release from NBC News.
"It's not about the committee election or the general election or whether Kavanaugh is elected, it's about how Republicans handle the issue and how they handle him", Guy Cecil, executive director of Priorities USA, a Democratic voting group, said in a press release.
However, Americans seem to have been divided over who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with most relying on the latter's testimony.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents doubt or are likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they doubt or are likely to believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
And 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's request for action, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one defendant, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee following an oath taken last week that Kavanaugh had been drunk and raped at age 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court nominee of showing her masculinity during a ceremony attended by a Yale student in the 1980s.
The inventor of the international web plans to launch a new web to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is about to start a company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology giant, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's ubiquitous web called Solid.
Solid enables users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to that data.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that Inrupt's goal is to "conquer the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the company he was about to start.
"It's time to remember".
The software uses Solid technology to allow users to set up a "personal online database" or POD.
It may include a contact list, a list of activities, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional resources.
It is compatible with Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all available in the same browser at the same time.
What is unique about this online private database is that it is entirely up to the user to determine the access to the data.
The company calls it "enhancing personal power through information".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company must bring in the right capabilities, practices and knowledge to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company is owned by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security network developed by IBM, some software developers have been contracted to work on various projects and a code-writing volunteer association.
Starting this week, technicians around the world can download applications running a serial network using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not "talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not they are launching a change in the way their business operates that could be completed in the shortest possible time.
"We're not going to ask for a new one".
In a Medium statement released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "purpose is to provide business-oriented power and connectivity to help maintain the integrity and integrity of the new Solid-built website".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the International Web Forum at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become a voice for change in conversations aimed at making the Internet seamless.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the Founder and CEO of the International Web Forum, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I have great confidence in the future of the international arena", said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: One of the WW1 Victoria Cross recipients was honored
A Church of England clergyman was awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I as a hero and celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Revera Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a drunk driver four days later and never knew he had won the highest medal in the British Army.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was laid by two of his grandchildren in a carpet in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, described it as a "beautiful sign" that the stone was properly quarried 100 years after the battle that won his grandfather his first major medal.
According to the London Gazette, 29 September 1918; Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion into the command of Saint-Quentin "through a heavy and heavy cloud of ground-based and machine-gun shells".
He then rushed to the battlefield and with "great courage" led his army to advance against the enemy until he was able to defeat the three opposing armies.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German mob on October 4, 1918, less than a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, described his grandfather's work as "something I know I can never do because it humbles him".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid flowers at the cemetery after the Holocaust, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
"I am very proud to have been a part of this carnival", said Michael Vann, adding that "the true strength of courage is shown by the support of the masses".
Fans of the martial arts known as MMA have been up all night waiting for Bellator 206, instead of watching the epic drama series Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching the Bellator 206 boxing match and ended up watching the much-anticipated fight.
The San Jose schedule was set for 13 matches, including six highly anticipated and aired live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were set to meet, television viewers in England were shocked when the goat was seen turning into the Peppa Pig.
Some were not happy with what happened after they spent the whole night awake until the early hours of the morning mostly waiting for a fight.
One fan on Twitter described the transformation of the child's tattoos as "unfounded humor".
"It is a federal law that 6:00 a.m. shows are not appropriate when they are changed to children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of communications and communications, when asked about the videos shown.
"Peppa the pig, yes".
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they would change their schedule to include British television viewers in the coming days.
"I think when I think about seeing the war over", said Coker, "I think that they might be able to do something about it".
"But it is six o'clock on Sunday morning when I go and we cannot change anything until it happens on Sunday at our time, which is Monday at their time.
But we must do something about it.
Believe me, when I translated the script, there were many manuscripts that came back and all did not bring the gospel.
We were trying to solve it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But it was not. It was the government's problem.
I promise you that tomorrow it will not happen again.
We'll divide them into five battles instead of six; as usual, we tried to give our fans more and we won.
It was a sad experience".
Desert Island Discs radio show: Tom Daley felt 'humbled' about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that growing up he felt humiliated by everyone because of his sexual orientation, but it was motivating him to have achieved his goal.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he went to high school and realized that "everyone is not like me".
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "a sense of optimism".
She also said that being a mother made her less interested in winning medals at the Olympics.
The longtime host, Kirsty Young, had taken months off due to illness.
As mentioned in Laverne's first interview, Daley said she felt she was "below" everyone else's age because "it was not legal in a family to love boys and girls".
"To this day", he says, "this feeling of inferiority and of being different has been a powerful force that has given me the strength and the ability to achieve my goals".
He wanted to show that he was "something", so that no one would be disappointed when he learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a well-known gay activist and used participation in the English-speaking and British-colonized Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge many countries to stop criminalizing same-sex sex.
He said he put it out because he felt he had the chance to live a free life without self-doubt and wanted to give others "a sense of optimism".
The three-time World Champion said dating the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013; "was a surprise to her".
Daley married an Oscar winner, 20 years older than her, last year but says the age difference has never been an issue.
"When you get through a lot of things you're young"; here he mentioned that he went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and that his stepfather died of cancer three days later, saying that it was hard to find someone who was as old as he was.
The lovers became parents in June, giving birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that "all of his thoughts" have changed.
"If you asked me what I needed most last year, I would say, 'I want to win a gold medal.'"
"You know that there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal winner is Robbie".
Her son, named after his father Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father never accepted his death and that the last thing he asked for was their tickets to the 2012 London Games; he wanted them to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't have said to him, 'Dad, you can't sit in the front row.'
"I held his hands when he breathed his last breath, and when he breathed his last I believed he was dead and I knew he was not breathed".
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I know that this is what I have dreamed of all my life, to compete in front of my country's fans at the Olympics, there is no greater pain than this".
It also inspired her to write her first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which was performed everywhere in preparation for the Olympics and became a sensation.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15am British time.
A late player named Mickelson was named as a substitute for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will need to improve his performance to avoid being unsuccessful.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial tournament for the 12th time, was named captain by captain Jim Furyk in a four-ball match against his teammates on Saturday.
Instead of being the primary player as he usually is in America, the winner of five major tournaments divides his day into sitting on the bench and working on his game to correct the wrongs.
Not a very good player despite his career highs, the 48-year-old is not physically fit to play in Le Golf National, where poor players lose.
And if the game itself is not enough, Mickelson, in the ninth round of Sunday, meets British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who played striker Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his games this week.
If the Americans, who have not scored four points after starting 12 games each, are starting a strong race, Mickelson's game may be a very important one.
Furyk expressed confidence in the man, although he could not say much more.
Furyk says: "He felt his role today, he put his hand on my back and shoulder and told me he was ready for tomorrow".
"She has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the most famous players and has made a significant contribution to the clubs in the past and this week.
I never saw him play two games.
I had seen much more, but the way it happened and the way we thought it would happen.
He wants to play like anyone else".
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
It may be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has not yet met his personal best.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and drew seven times, although Furyk said his presence made the team valuable.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's smart, he's a slanderer, and he's a good guy you'd want to have on a team", he explains.
"I think the young players enjoyed being with him, and this week was a good one to watch.
He gives more than just plays".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his leadership and high scores could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows that leading with the most points to the final day of a single Ryder Cup match can easily be turned upside down.
Dane's first season was 1997 at Valderrama, where the team, led by captain Seve Ballesteros, led by five points ahead of the Americans but finished with a few points ahead, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep in mind that we led by most points at Valderrama; we led at Brookline, where he lost, and at Valderrama, where he won, but that's it", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 players win 5-3 in the game on Friday and yesterday leading by 10-6 in the Le Golf National tournament.
So history will show me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
But you will use all your energy tomorrow.
Go out and do only the right thing.
It was not until you found the score written on the board.
We also have a goal to try and win this Cup, which is where we are focused.
I can focus on 12 players on our side, but we know what we stand for on the other side; the world's best players".
Bjorn continues to express his admiration for my players playing on a challenging golf course, saying: "I can't get ahead of myself in these competitions.
Tomorrow is even more important.
Tomorrow is a personal game to be played and the difference is what we should do.
It is good to be with the player when things are going well, but when you are playing alone, then try your best as a golfer.
This is the message you should send to the athletes, to get them to give their best tomorrow.
Now leave your money behind and go, reap what you have sown and reap what you have sown".
Unlike Bjorn, a different number and costume by Jim Furyk will see his players behave to play better individually than their counterparts, notably Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on the eve of the final day of the tournament, where he was part of the Brooklyn team that won the title before losing to Europe in the "Miracle at Medinah" tournament.
"I remember how every word made it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, managed the players to the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah.
When the force is directed toward one side, it puts pressure on the midfielders.
We set the players who played by the game and we release the players in the right way we feel like we're going to be, you know, we're going to try to do wonders tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the team to qualify and meet Rory McIlroy in the semi-final, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the first round of the competition.
Bjorn comments on selecting players for single-player matches: "I took this team as follows because I think it has all the players that will be useful".
The new German warship is changing the times again.
A new German warship was authorized for service in 2014 to replace the old Cold War war vessels, but was not available until at least the following year due to poor system performance and high costs, local media reported.
The permit to sail the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the newly-branded Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been extended until early 2019, according to Die Zeit, in a statement by a military spokesman.
The wreckage was discovered by other warships in 2014, but problems with shipping caused the massive project to suffer.
The Baden-Wuerttemberg-class four ships were a class of ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the older Bremen-class ships.
It must of course have strong, multi-layered, air and ship anti-aircraft guns and seawater technology, such as radar vision reduction, red-ray signals and hearing and sound recorders.
Another important feature of the ships is that they have been repaired after a long period of time, which means that it is possible to ship new ships at least two years from the date of origin.
However, the delay means that ships with advanced technology, which has been suggested could give Germany a more powerful road network, will be out of date when they are put into service, according to Die Zeit.
The F125's timeless design was reported in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to allow the vessel to go to sea and return it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to its manufacturer after it had been dismantled.
There is no known reason for the delay, but German newspapers reported that several serious "programming and machine" defects caused the ship to be delayed in combat.
In particular, the programming flaws were particularly severe when the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships were to be operated by the 120th Fleet, a division of the Bremen class of sailors.
And it has been shown that a ship's weight is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and reducing the Navy's capability in the coming days with updated ship supplies.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz was twice the weight of the same class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty machinery, the cost of the entire project, including training sailors, is also a problem.
It is estimated to have reached 3.1 billion yuan (US$3.6 billion), up from 2.2 billion yuan planned.
The problems facing these new types of ships are being re-examined with the recent announcement that the strength of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German parliament's Defence Committee, agreed that the navy is currently "lacking the vessels to be used in the event of an attack".
The captain said that the problem has grown over time, as older ships have ceased to operate on the sea but no replacement ships have been delivered.
He confessed that no Baden-Wuerttemberg ships were able to join the navy.

New research is underway in a building in the Scottish highlands to show how insects use the highlands to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results of this study will provide a clearer picture of the specific behavior of mammals and help to determine how to perform their conservation activities.
The research, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and unusual earless beetles and the well-known long-eared beetles of the Daubenton genus in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in a central location on the building to monitor emergency activities throughout the year.
An NHS worker and volunteer will also conduct a walking investigation using a machine that detects where the parasites are being caught in the hands.
An expert sound analysis of all recorded sounds will determine the order of the sounds we are talking about and the type of sounds that are performing certain actions.
A map of the locations of the bugs will be provided to provide a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, believes that the results of this study will identify areas of habitat that are most important to insects and that are used by each species.
These tips will help to identify the benefits of managing insect habitat such as growing grass for grazing by leaving behind trees that are cultivated by insects and other closely related species.
The number of musicians in Scotland and England has declined dramatically over the past century.
We are affected by the construction and development projects that are hampering their own resources and the lack of housing.
Wind turbines and lightning can also cause problems with wind shear and some building materials and the use of domestic cats.
The spiders are usually sighted.
However, because we hunt at night, their ears are more important than their eyes when catching prey.
We use sound-based positioning to determine the exact position of the particles and the obstacles to their movement.
The NTS, which manages over 270 historic buildings, 38 historic gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in various parts of the country, provides extensive care for the earthquake.
It has ten dedicated specialists, who conduct constant research, monitor the presence of parasites and sometimes rescue parasites.
The family also established a specialised Scottish breed and the first breed of frog in the Threave breed in Dumfries and Galloway, with eight of the ten species of frog found in Scotland.
Building inspector David Thompson says the building is a good place for the fireworks.
"Here in Threave, there is a good area for the lightning".
"We have old buildings, grown trees, and beautiful places where the bugs can grow.
But there was a lot about the bugs that was unknown, so our job here and in other buildings is to help us better understand what we need to keep it going".
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bugs before building repairs because demolishing without first seeing the bugs could kill up to 400 small bugs, potentially saving the entire species.
We are also protected by law from cursing, killing, or destroying.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of the Scottish Parrot Conservation Trust, has urged the public to come to their aid.
"We still have a lot to learn about our ants, and there are many of our tribes that we don't know how they live".
Ronaldo denied the allegations of rape as legal professionals prepared to take a German newspaper to court
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the allegations of rape as "rumors", saying that people "want to identify themselves" using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese national team player and Juventus player is approaching the scene of an alleged rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet and not talk about what happened, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers within hours of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, denied the allegations, calling them "rumors".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, it's rumors", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in front of the camera.
"They want to make themselves known by my name.
It is normal.
They want to be known by my name, but it's part of our job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers were preparing to press charges against the Der Spiegel newspaper, which reported the allegations, calling it "unlawful disclosure of suspected privacy claims", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the actor sought compensation for "the seriousness of the injustice that may have been the most serious human rights violation in recent years".
The allegations allegedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in bed, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped him in the hip, according to documents released by the Clark County Superior Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo bowed down after the incident and told him that "99 percent" was a "good person" and was disappointed by that "one percent".
Records show that Ronaldo acknowledged the two had had sexual relations, but they were in agreement.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries while in hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter without going to court because she felt "scared of bullying" and was still concerned that she would be "publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old model says she is now trying to change the settlement because she is still disturbed by what happened.
Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid after a rumoured absence and this summer he moved to the giant Juventus for £100 million.
Brexit: Britain's 'perpetual regret' of losing its car manufacturing industry
Britain "may regret forever" losing its world-first automobile name after leaving the European Union, said Secretary of State for Trade Greg Clark.
He added: "It is worrying that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU there is no agreement that it will temporarily cease operating cars at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need to get along", Clark said.
A Japanese automaker has said that the consequences of border delays would be a lack of consensus when Britain's full membership of the European Union leads to high unemployment.
Burnaston, which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to EU countries.
Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive in Burnaston, said: "My view is that if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, there will be a car production in our factory".
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns that there will be no existing deal to trade across borders with the EU, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close a small factory in Oxford one month after the UK leaves the European Union.
The main concern is that the car industry claims that the way they access the equipment is because they are selling products that are in trouble in the event of a dispute following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
Toyota is working to "reduce production time, with equipment arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for the production of ordered vehicles.
When the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a dispute over the suspension of operations where the industry claims that it could lead to delays and overloads of equipment.
It is unlikely that Toyota will be able to store cars made in a single day in its warehouse at a factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and it could halt production of the car.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan to leave the European Union included plans for relations with the EU "which have been extensively revised to ensure strict border controls".
"We need to make a deal. " In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: "We want to make a good deal that will not only achieve our goals this season but also enable us to achieve those opportunities".
"Obviously, not only for Toyota but also for other automotive manufacturers where we need to be able to maintain the existing accessories and product solutions that meet the target".
Toyota has not been able to say when production of cars will stop, but in the long run, it has warned that rising prices will reduce the industry's market competitiveness and not lead to higher job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the factory's labour union, says that his members remain concerned: "In my opinion, when some jobs are eliminated, they never come back.
"We must develop a solid and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union", a government spokesman said.
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could be avoided again as reported by the US Office of the President
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with the top official of the US, Rod Rosenstein, could be "postponed to another week" as the race for the top vaccine nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, continues; this was announced by the US Office of the President on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump-Russia relations and the president's denial of justice.
Whether or not Trump can dismiss the state's top diplomat, and whether it would jeopardize Mueller's independence, has sparked several months of Washington's rumors.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had allegedly worn a recorder to record a conversation he had with Trump and the possibility of a presidential nomination under the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the claims.
But last Monday, he went to the US President's Office, rumored to be resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, held at the UN headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "opted" not to fire Rosenstein but that the reconciliation meeting was now postponed because he avoided meeting the Senate Judiciary Committee on the case where Kavanaugh and one of his female sexual misconduct accusers, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump called on the FBI to investigate allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the consultation by Rosenstein, he said: "It is an unconfirmed date, which may be this month, which may be postponed to another week due to other Supreme Court events.
But we'll all see how it goes and I'll always be updating the media".
Some journalists disagree with the report: Sanders has not called a meeting at the US President's Office since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace wondered why.
Sanders said the lack of new media was not due to the dislike of television journalists "for their inappropriate behavior", although he said: "I disagree with him because he says they are inappropriate".
He then said that direct communication between Trump and the media is on the rise.
"The president is more likely to be questioned and answered than any president before him", he said, adding that he had said without proof: "We looked at the numbers".
The news conference is still ongoing, Sanders says, but "if the media gets the chance to interview the president directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot and you've seen us do it in the last few weeks and it will take me a while to get some new information when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump normally receives questions when he leaves the Office of the President of the United States or when he is interviewed or at a press conference with a visiting dignitary.
Even a media interview alone is rare.
This week in New York, a president has been making excuses, breaking the law and sometimes making extraordinary appearances before a press conference.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working for NHS Scotland on concerns that the UK will be leaving the EU
The Secretary of State for Health wrote to the staff of the European Union working at the NHS in Scotland expressing their appreciation and wish to remain in the workforce after the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of EU citizens working on its services.
In a letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the outcome continued, discussing the expected resolution in this area.
But the UK government has stepped up its preparedness in the absence of a deal.
I know that these are very difficult times for all of us.
So I would like to talk about it again today to show how I value the contributions of each employee, regardless of nationality.
My colleagues from the EU countries bring useful experience and knowledge that enhances and improves the quality of work in health services and benefits patients and the organizations we serve.
Scotland is certainly at home, and we look forward to having you stay".
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a severe head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Tennessean team spokesman Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before his first season's retirement.
"He came over and fell", Reed says.
Trainees and doctors added Abercrombie's oxygen to the side of the stadium before putting him on a pillow and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State team employee told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no information was available on the extent/duration of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine the exact time of the injury.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, was his first year at Tennessee State after receiving a transfer from Illinois.
On Sunday, he hit a home run before leaving the game, where b led all scorers to 18.
Foreign buyers will be taxed heavily on government-issued documents when they purchase real estate in the UK.
Foreign buyers are subject to high taxes on property purchases in the UK where the higher tax rate is used to help the homeless under the new policies of British politicians
This is to prevent Corbyn's campaign to attract young people to vote.
Tax on government documents will be paid to ordinary taxpayers in the UK
The State Treasurer plans to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are taxed at a high rate on property purchases in the UK where the higher rates are used to help the homeless, as announced by Theresa May today.
The scheme appears to be an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to reach a target of attracting young people to vote where it promises to get cheap housing and pay higher taxes to those who work harder.
Increased taxation on government-issued personal data and tax-exempt corporations in the UK, where the excess is intended to strengthen the government's policy to combat homelessness.
These high tax rates, which are a result of the taxation on existing government documents, include the two-year high rates for second-home and rental homeowners and the tax rate of about three percent.
The state treasurer expects the project to raise £120 million annually.
The 13th percentile of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first time buyers to live in.
In many of our richest areas of the country; in particular, in the capital, "uninhabited cities" have become so popular because large numbers of foreign real estate buyers spend a lot of time away from the country.
The new measures came a week after Boris Johnson called for lowering government bond taxes to help young people to own their own homes.
He accused the massive construction efforts of keeping housing prices high on the unused land and urged Mrs May to allow lower taxes on low-cost housing to address the "suspicious housing crisis" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced several interesting reforms, including a tax cuts ban and an end to the failure of independent homeowners to "dismiss tenants without a reasonable cause".
He also wants to give the board powerful authority to build new buildings.
"Last year I said I would put a lot of effort into reviving the British dream; that life should be better for every new generation", Mrs May said.
And that means that we need to address the problems that arise in the housing market.
The UK will continue to welcome people who want to live, work and seek a life here.
However, it is not to say that it will be easier for non-UK residents and for foreign companies who want to buy homes as easily as the hardworking UK residents.
For many people, their dreams of a home have been shattered, and sleeping in a bad environment is becoming more and more true".
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to coach the Scottish national team'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "big goal" is to become the head coach of the Scottish national team for a while.
The 42-year-old Scotsman, looking to make the most of his ability to bring back the North East side in good times, is third in the Second Division Championship, scoring three points to take the lead.
He went on to train at the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Championship last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was called up to the B team and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden often with my father as a child and it was always something that made me go back.
That opportunity comes at a time when I can train the team well".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he feels secure after taking over from the top coaches who have coached the club, having previously refused to coach clubs including Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My current achievement will be tested by the question, 'Can I get this team back to the Premier League?'
"Given the nature and foundations of this club, there is no doubt that it should go to the Premier League".
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I think I can only achieve my goals here when I can't get this team back in the league".
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a long stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and spent 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third division and converted the relegated St Mirren team to the second division, winning the league title the following season.
And Ross says he feels better now after his career achievements at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was possible that the paths would meet in their own way", he recalls saying this while coaching Alloa.
"I certainly thought that being a parent was the hardest thing I could do than play.
It seems strange but it is okay, I have lived a good life and am happy with what I have achieved.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you can do each week.
I still go through it but it's in the form of a stereo and a shadow of a woman but I feel training is a good thing.
I have always wanted to train and now I do, and I feel that I have been a quiet adult all my life".

The cold summer sun has increased the number of British people going to the slums but putting a lot of pressure on various restaurants.
The number of guests in the restaurant group increased by 2.7 percent in July; however, the number of guests in the restaurant decreased by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA's economic adviser, who compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and the continued decline in the World Cup standings in England means that July will follow June's trend, with a 2.8 percent increase in bar attendance, with the restaurant sector continuing to be hit hard.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
The alcohol bar was more efficient than the restaurants would have been backwards.
Our food pantries were also made from the sun, although not as big as the restaurants alone.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and get a drink.
The number of bars selling alcohol increased by 6.6 percent per month, while food fell by three percent".
Paul Newman, who works for the entertainment and hospitality consultancy RSM, said: "These figures continue to fluctuate as we have seen since the end of April.
The trend and other influences on interconnected activities and sports continue to be a major contributor to the shift in the non-domestic sector of the food industry.
Not surprisingly, restaurant companies continue to struggle, although sales have fallen by 4.8 percent year on year, which is likely to be particularly hurtful and exacerbate the current purchasing pressure.
The most hot summer has not come at the wrong time for the restaurant companies and time will tell if the average temperature we saw in August will give us the rest we were waiting for".
Total bar and restaurant sales, including newly opened ones, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in opening named bars and restaurants.

One in five children, some of them minors up to 11 years old, have private social media accounts where they hide their parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in "fake Instagram" pages
The report highlights the growing fear of sexual violence.
Twenty percent of students said they have "normal" accounts with their parents.
One in three children, who are about 11 years old, would set up secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of about 20,000 high school students found that there was a significant increase in "false Instagram" accounts, which refer to the photo sharing platform Instagram.
The report reflects the growing fear of sexual violence.
Twenty percent of students said they make the most of their "normal" accounts, while keeping others confidential.
One parent who accidentally went to the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter finds the young man asking others to "rape him".
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had dual profiles, with half of them agreeing to private accounts.
"It's very sad to see teenagers being duped into setting up online sites where parents and teachers can't find them", said HMC Director Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "spokesperson" for the Scottish Athletics Conference
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director of the Executive Board at the Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is a highly successful Scottish athlete and the club's chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as an opportunity for sports managers to benefit from the vast international experience of the past decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and international community and we are confident that Scottish players can benefit greatly from bringing him to the board", Beattie said.
"I am excited to be the voice of the sport and I believe I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland", Doyle said.
The American, who won medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games and is one of four Olympic gold medalists to win, is now a regular commentator for the BBC, where he was left unable to walk after suffering a short-term stroke known as TIA.
He tweeted: "A month later I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
Doctors said that the time would determine whether or not I would recover or lock him up.
It was a difficult operation, but I recovered well, learned to walk again, and today I am exercising my legs!
Thank you for sending me a message of encouragement!"
The advertising of the Red Pumps, which represents parents and cows, has generated a lot of controversy online.
A company that makes pumps for the greenhouse effect has generated a lot of online commentary after an ad compared women who are breastfeeding to beef cattle.
To launch what has been described as the "world's first noise-free fluid pump", technology company Elvie has released a publicity campaign in the form of a crowd-sourced music video to showcase the freedom the new pump offers to women who want to express themselves.
Four real parents dance in a grassed cottage in a song that includes the words, "Yes, I will, but you can't see my tail" and "If you haven't seen it, it's not the spots, it's my breasts".
The message says, "She pumped out, she pumped out, I fed the babies, she pumped out, she pumped out, I bowed my wives".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a dispute online.
The video, which was watched by 77,000 people and received thousands of views, received mixed reviews, with many saying it exposes the "bad" developments in the dairy industry.
"It is an inappropriate decision to use cows to promote this product.
One said, We need pregnant women like ourselves to give birth and breastfeed, unless their babies are fed on the day they are born.
The Elvie fluorescent pump is so well-done that it is invisible in the sucking mother's suction tube (Elvie/Parent)
Another suggests: "It is quite understandable that this is a major concern for parents and their babies.
But why not use that advertisement to promote a rainy day for parents who decide to keep their babies?"
Another added: "This is a far-reaching advertisement".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "laughing".
"I think this is a good idea.
I would have taken one if I was a nursing mother.
Pumping made me feel better and better.
The ad was a bit crazy, but I took it.
One of the scribes wrote: 'This is a product of wisdom.'
Another suggests: "This ad is aimed at parents who are smiling (often at work or in private) and feel like a cow".
This is not a statement that praises or condemns the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women show themselves dancing with invisible pumps hooked up in their suits.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women using a vertical pump feel like cows.
However, the pump, manufactured by Elvie, has no dirt, no ropes or holes and fits smoothly into the woman's suction suit, giving the woman the freedom to move, pick up their babies and go outside to cuddle.
Ana Balarin, partner and child development manager at Mother, suggested: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that needs to be marketed in a unique way.
In trying to compare female volunteers to beef cattle, we wanted to show the flexibility and flexibility of the cattle, while also showing the warmth and flexibility of the pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has been the subject of much media attention.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared to be showing a live fashion show by fashion designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to camps along the Texas border
The number of migrant children incarcerated has increased dramatically despite the fact that the number of monthly border crossings has not changed significantly, partly due to the strong wording and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it more difficult to provide custodial children.
Most insurers are also undocumented immigrants and fear they may jeopardize their ability to remain in the country if they apply for a child.
The disaster was compounded in June when government agencies announced that those who wanted to adopt the children and other adults in their households had to file a petition and that the information had to be filed with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the court that the agency had taken in dozens of applicants for the custody of minors without adult escort.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had never committed another crime.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who want to become insurers or members of an insurance company are here illegally and most of them are immigrants who have committed crimes.
Mr. Albence: "So, we're still following these people".
In order to provide a faster way to file a child, authorities introduced new laws requiring that some of the children be brought to court within a month of their arrest, rather than 60 days later, which was agreed upon by immigration officials.
Most are seen by video calls, rather than by appearing in person, to ask the immigration judge to see if they can obtain legal residency.
Those considered ineligible for deportation will be immediately repatriated to their country of origin.
The longer children remain in prison, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, leading to anger and conflict and attempts to escape, according to immigration staff and reports from the system in recent months.
Advocates say the concerns are expressed in a large facility such as Tornillo, where there are signs of childhood abuse that are more often overlooked due to the size.
They add that moving children to tents without giving them enough time to express themselves emotionally and say goodbye to friends can lead to a lot of stress they would struggle with.
Syria tells the US, France and Turkey that 'the occupied territories' must respond immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the eight-year-old civil war.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil claiming to be fighting terrorism and that they would be adequately treated
"The troops must return immediately and without further delay", he told the assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terror is coming to an end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and more than a million have been evacuated.
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this holy war until all parts of Syria are expelled" from terrorist groups and "foreigners in the illegal territory".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily for training and advising the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces on President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in a war-torn part of the country.
On the issue of the chimpanzee, Moualem said the requirements were adequate for their return and criticized "some Western countries" for "stimulating the population" and leaving refugees abroad.
"We have called on international organizations and aid organizations to facilitate their return", he said.
"They would change politics if it were just a humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there may be no support for Syria's reconstruction until an agreement between Assad and his opposition is reached to end the war.
Diplomats at the UN say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a breathing zone at a time of critical Idlib military presence has created the possibility of forcing political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive Russian-backed Syrian military offensive on the region of 3 million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement clearly set "finite dates" and expressed confidence that military action against the jihadist forces, including the militants of the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, would also "be eliminated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, believes that the first meeting of the new government-opposition committee will soon be held to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and prepare the electoral process.
Moualem instructed the Syrian government to respond to the committee, saying that the work of the council should focus on "examining the provisions of the current constitution", and warning of possible disruption.
What will Trump win for a second term?
According to the rhetoric, Mr. Trump is the winner of the 2020 election, unless the most likely candidate is a close eyewitness, a presidential candidate and a serious challenge to his term.
"It was like the last great presidential game ever!"
To this day, there is no evidence that those who witnessed the event failed.
Since 2014, the ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 on CNN and more than 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million, up 1.7 from four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is the highest-rated television program with 3.5 million viewers as the nightly news headline.
"This is the fire people would be thrown into because they don't feel anything", said Neal Baer, director of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the US Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different perspective.
She recalls being abducted in a car in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is recreation when it is possible.
Of course, while nothing else is the same on TV, the news that follows Washington may determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families may reunite and the global economy will recover.
Clearly, only positive visions can be received by television viewers.
And, it turns out that only the public is informed when you find yourself watching television for six hours where various experts are debating the use of Bob Woodward's "unproven interrogation technique" in his book "Fear", a coat made from Paul Manafort's $15,000-worth of oatmeal ("a lot of flower debt", according to The Washington Post) and the inclusion of Stormy Daniels' disgusting portrayal of Mr. Trump's body.
I, as a person, cannot see Super Mario in any other way.
"One of his most unusual actions is a seemingly real conversation where he gives you new information every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and co-founder of Pawn Stars, referring to Trump's talk show changing actors and changing stories every day (in which he attacks the N.F.L. talk show, praising Kim Jong-un).
You should not miss a section or be left behind.
I tried to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, and there was a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was in the house watching MSNBC while he was taking CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, even with Brett Kavanaugh having to meet the Senate Emergency Committee and the Supreme Court's future without stopping.
"I remember when we were having a crazy conversation a few days ago and people said, 'This is the beginning of the West's moral shift,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was funny, but they were right".

Foreign money is being used heavily in midterm elections where contestants compete with few votes
It is no wonder that the 17th Pennsylvania election is expensive, given the fact that the districts are now eligible for the same election and the two congressmen are running for the same seat.
Recently, the Pittsburgh City Council re-designated Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb; who won his seat in another district in a special election this winter.
Lamb is facing another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which is closely tied to the new 17th District.
The maps were added to the drawing after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally dismantled to deny the Republicans' chances.
The resilience in District 17 has led to a conflict of campaign funds between the major parties, the Democratic-Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican-Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after defeating his opponents by fewer points in a special election in March in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held by a Republican for ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts have shown that Democrats are likely to win with fewer points.
The United States is considering sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, and later retaliating against it.
Diplomats learned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing's government, not Washington's.
Mr. Trump held a successful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 where he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners were fired by the Trump Organization's management team.
Government officials have decided to request the withdrawal of US officials from diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the government, said in a speech earlier this month.
But sanctions were only expected to be imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in stimulus in 2017, including drug control, development assistance and economic assistance.
The sanctions, which included a reduction in financial support and visa restrictions, would severely jeopardize the Central American country and the continued rise in unemployment and homicide rates.
As the Intergovernmental Conference continued, North and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference on security and economic development to follow up on what appeared to be a meeting last year that was seen as a step toward restricting immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the talks to continue, immediately lifting all concerns about sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence, who is now expected to address the meeting, which is now scheduled for mid-October, is a sign of the leadership's strength at the meeting, according to diplomats.
And three American ambassadors have returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong message of sanctions issued by the state of Washington.
US President's spokesman, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on whether the conversation was interpreted by three US officials, including two US diplomats, who were due to discuss a series of secret talks that they wished their names not to be revealed.
Their claims were confirmed by an independent investigator working closely with the government and who also requested that his names not be disclosed.
Learning about history
The next person to be fired may be special counsel Robert Mueller, due to reports he gave to Mr Trump that he may be a threat to the public, which have been well documented in the media.
Mr. Mueller said he was changing the investigation he was working on to determine whether Mr. Trump's campaign officials had ties to Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress changes its position, Mr. Trump may find himself being held accountable for the allegations made by the Department, as he prepares to return to the House and possibly to his peers.
This is a very deliberate plan, and I'm not saying I don't suggest that Mr. Trump's farm should not be taken seriously, or how he should be treated in Europe.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make that determine how long we can endure.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to overthrow Hitler, when the West would have stood up and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We were so exhausted and missed the chance to prevent the years of human death from happening.
The course of history is heavily influenced by these great achievements and the democratic process can be delayed or delayed.
Americans are in the middle of these serious operations right now.
What can we do when Mr. Trump fires his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the future of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water since a newspaper report last year claimed he called for a secret ballot and spread rumors that he was unfit to run for president.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story reported by The Times is inaccurate.
"How do we respond to the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh when it is not done in a complete or impartial manner; or when he is confirmed to be the presiding judge of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual misconduct and fraudulent testimony?
Besides, will we vote in the midterm elections to elect Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable for his actions?
If we fail to do this, democracy will be back on its feet.
But I hope we will not fail, given my training in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi occupation of the embassy where I lived.
He survived, moved to the United States and 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath banners on a table with a Nazi sign.
If I still consider it my legacy, how can I have confidence in our future?"

Rangers forward Graham Dorrans is confident ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that if they beat the Australians, after beating Spanish side Villarreal earlier this month, they will be in a good position to exit Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury to midfielder Graham Dorrans after his first appearance in the game ended in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can rely on the outcome of the game as the beginning of a serious situation.
"It was a good score because Villarreal were a good team", the 31-year-old said.
"We went to the game hoping we could do something, but we scored.
We may have won the game coming to an end, but overall, the draw seems to be a good way to end the game.
It is possible that the best players in the first half will be the ones we follow in the second half and they are the ones who played well overall.
On Thursday, another major European tournament took place.
I'm sure we can get three points but it will be a great game because they won their last game, but with our fans, I'm sure we can play well and win each other.
Last year was a big year, in the middle of everything I broke down and changed the team I was playing for, but there's something good about the team I'm playing for now.
It's a good team and my teammates appreciate it, training goes well.
I hope we can look for ways to win now, forget about last year and get to the goal".
Women would be sleep deprived from the current fears of the cost of a big recovery
While some respondents understood exactly how much attention they wanted, few would talk to their family members about it.
About half of the people in a Nationwide survey said they would talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about the issue.
"People want family attention, but they don't talk about the steps they take", said Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance at Nationwide.
Here is where they should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot arrange your family to be cared for unless you express your wishes in advance.
Consult with your counselor and family to discuss the location and treatment options, as these options may be a cost-effective factor.
Bring a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find ways to pay for expenses.
The options for spending your money on long-term care include regular long-term care insurance, life insurance and a secondary income insurance to cover expenses or to be self-sufficient with your own funds as long as you have funds.
Find the answer to your legal documents: Avoid everlasting lawsuits.
Find alternative medical options to appoint a representative to oversee your treatment and to ensure that doctors respect your wishes when you are unable to express your opinion.
And you should also consider the potential impact of your money.
You can choose a trusted person to make a financial decision for you and to ensure that your bills are paid when you are unable to afford them.
Remember to keep in mind the little details: Think of it as if your elderly parent had a medical condition that needs urgent treatment and was on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about her medication and her physical disabilities?
Write down the details so that you can prepare.
"It's not just the financial issues that are being considered", Martin asks, "but who are the doctors?"
"What medication is given?
Who will take care of the dog?
That is the plan".
A man was shot several times by a gunman in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, aged 40, was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 pm British time, as "a deliberate act".
The victim never saw anyone shoot him.
His injuries were not fatal and the police requested that some witnesses testify.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, with the death toll expected to rise.
While the reception and transmission system was not functioning, officials in the relief efforts were unable to receive data from Donggala, a region in northern Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palos, more than 16,000 people were rescued after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palu is a city in Central Sulawesi, located near the coastline of the western coast of Sulawesi Peninsula, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was recalling 40 years ago when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a region of over 300 km (180 mi) long coastline in the northwest of the Sulawesi Peninsula.
The area, an administrative subdivision of the state, has an estimated population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities in Central Sulawesi, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nuclear mining is also important in the region, but mining is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi Gulf.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Institute of Disaster Management.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located above the Pacific Ocean's equator and is constantly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the western coast of Aceh province, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami to hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, half of them from Aceh.
2005: Subsequent major earthquakes occurred off the coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck a region near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami that raised water to 10 meters and destroyed several villages, killing 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake struck Pidie Jaya province of Aceh, causing extensive damage and devastating deaths, reminding the community of the 2004 tsunami that devastated and killed many.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the flooding.
2018: A major earthquake struck the tourist-visited Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly affecting the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without temporary shelter.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of sexual assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which violated the domestic violence notice and was arrested, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman she knew tried to call the police to tell them about the crimes she was accused of, she took away her phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and has given an unfounded bail of $500, according to KTUU.
He was brought before a court on Saturday, where he said he "absolutely denied the allegations" when asked whether he accepted the charges, according to the television.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which carries a sentence of up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a day in jail and a fine of $2,000 USD.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, she was accused of abusing her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, calls the police to tell her about the abuse.
He is currently being tried before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of a domestic crime and having a drug overdose.
The girl he was dating wanted to punch him in the face.
Sarah Palin was fired by a group of ex-confederates in 2016 after combining her son's violent behavior with the upheavals caused by his deployment to Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died after the earthquake struck Sulawesi Island, Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Fire Communications networks have been damaged and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck Sulawesi in the Middle Ages, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on international social media to show when the earthquake began.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a sandy festival in Palu city when the tsunami washed ashore.
Prosecutors would seek an unusual death sentence to prevent a terrorist attack in NYC.
New York state prosecutors were seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City suicide bombing that killed eight people; a rare sentence that has not been given in the state for a crime against the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to hit pedestrians on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists on the road in October.
To uphold the death penalty, prosecutors must confirm that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" injured others severely, according to a notice seeking the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offences could result in the death penalty, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, the Supreme Court indicted Saipov on 22 counts including the murder of eight people in aiding and abetting illegal financing, which was used by the prosecutors in criminal proceedings and in allegations of cruelty and damage to property.
The attack requires "well-planned and deliberate", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's use of "a brutal, brutal and brutal attack".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injured, injured and killed the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims of the attack were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the District Court of New York last handed down a sentence of death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was later sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
When the last execution sentence in a state trial in New York was handed down in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the divorced couple were later convicted of spying for the former Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
Rosenbergs was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has expressed no regrets about his actions in the months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt better about his actions, according to police reports.
Saipov told authorities that he had the idea of an attack after viewing videos of the Islamic State terrorist group on his phone, according to a document containing the allegations against him.
He also requested the establishment of a ISIS terrorist cell in his hospital room, according to the police.
He pleaded no contest to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defendants representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than the plea bargain to accept the charges and to receive a life sentence without possibility of parole will further shock all those affected by the incident", Patton said.
The defence team of the accused, Saipov, had asked the prosecutors not to refuse the death penalty.
A Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given the task of negotiating the UK's exit from the EU
Nigel Farage is determined to 'incite the people' today in the rally taking place at the Tory Party meeting.
The former leader of the Ukip party says politicians should step back from the 'shadow' of criticism of the EU, where a member of parliament from the party herself, Theresa May, has said she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
An outgoing conservative MP, Peter Bone, told a visiting Birmingham audience that the UK had 'just left the EU' now that Mr Farage is the Secretary of State for UK Exiting the EU.
But the challenge for Ms May is to unite her colleagues with a different viewpoint that would have driven the Tory Party's desire to remain in the EU into another urban protest against Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his plan to withdraw Britain from the European Union timely while being attacked by both British and European Union activists.
The partners continued to say that he would continue to try to find a compromise with Belgium despite some negative reactions, and pressed him to criticize the European Union and the Labour Party to decide on his own issues.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave party in Solihull that he wanted to 'dissolve Britain's intention to leave the European Union'.
He said that Mr. Farage should also be included and given the task of negotiating with Belgium.
'If he had been the master, we would have gone out already,' they said.
The MP for Wellingborough continued: 'I will support the UK's withdrawal from the EU but we need to abolish the UK's withdrawal from the EU.'
Speaking on his position on the European Union, he said: 'We have never fought world wars to show our weakness.
We want to make laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone has rejected the public's demands since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the community is not at all true.'
A Tory member who wants Britain to leave the European Union, Andrea Jenkyns, was also on the trip, telling reporters: 'All I want to say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The UK's decision to leave the EU is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and the reformers we work with take to the streets are the primary driving force behind our election.
Let the plan begin and listen.'
In a similar message to Ms May, she said: 'The Prime Ministers remain in office as long as they fulfil the contract.'
Mr Farage told traveling politicians that they must feel 'shadow' if we are to plot the decision taken in the 2016 election.
'Now it's about trust between us, the people and the political establishment.'
'They would try to plot the UK's plan to leave the EU and we are here today to tell them that 'we will never tolerate you being blamed.'
In a message to the happy crowd, he said: 'I want to put our political platform, which is about to plot Britain's exit from the European Union, in the shadows.
'We are urging the people to protect this country that has won the victory in removing Britain from the European Union and we will never rest until we are self-sufficient, led, and proud of Britain.'
Meanwhile, England's nationalists made a two-hour stopover to Birmingham before heading to the city centre.
Reformers discussed the disagreements by waving their Tory flags against Britain's withdrawal from the European Union after the group was formed that weekend.
Labour members including Lord Adonis criticized the old-fashioned safety concerns they faced at the party's opening session.
He added: 'These are the people who tell us that we have a technological base and that all of Canada's technology is advanced, customs-free borders, border trade with Ireland is full.'
'That's not true at all.
There is nothing better than taking Britain out,' he added.
Warren plans to "think deeply" about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November in a race against Republican Party candidate Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He has been rumored in various rumours that he may run for President Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the electorate in the representative district using the two-party system since Trump took office.
The delegate asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded, "The time has come for women to go to Washington and to govern our divided state, where women will be the leaders".
A man has been arrested in a fight that resulted in the death of Sims while playing for LSU.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, La., Police announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU college basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. eastern time, according to the news release.
They released a video of the Friday riot, asking people to help them identify the person in the photos.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims died from a gunshot wound to the head and died at the scene", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde had come to rescue her friend and was raped by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the shooting with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and transferred to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-2 forward from Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games, starting 10 last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton was nearing the World Cup after the team claimed victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas scored the race points ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes confirmed his major contribution to the car race.
From the start of the race, Bottas got off to a good start and was close to beating Hamilton as he struggled for a place in the first two matches and caused Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went to the car's tire changeover first and left Hamilton behind in the final, a decisive decision.
Mercedes were well behaved and came after Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a collision with Ferrari and the driver lost control, leaving a gap and leaving him with a third-place opponent.
Max Verstappen started from behind the other cars and came seventh after the first race on his 21st birthday.
He leads the majority of the race while riding his wheels to reach the finish line by passing Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
He also reached the 44th wheel of the car but was unable to improve his speed in the final eight laps where Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a good job all weekend and became a good person.
Hamilton: The team did an extraordinary job to get the first and second place".
It was a very bad physical expression.
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dianne Feinstein's candidacy on Saturday for insisting that she was not the one who published a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexually abusing her.
Speaking in a campaign in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but suggested that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "bad, cruel and unfaithful".
"One thing that could happen and is good is that the past few days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people angry and bad and cruel and unfaithful".
"If you look at the amazing things that have been published without permission, you will say, 'Oh, I never did.
I did not".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you ever published it without permission?
Remember his response... to the one who once published the document without permission; "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I never got out".
It is good, except for a little.
We have not published without permission...No, we have not published without permission", he said, to the delight of the writer.
Feinstein received a letter explaining the Kavanaugh allegations made by Ford in July and were made public without authorization in early September, but Feinstein denied the publication without explicit authorization from his office.
"I have never concealed the allegations of Dr. Ford, I have not made his story publicly known", Feinstein told the committee, reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as he asked".
But his denial was apparently not well received by the president, who commented during Saturday night's campaign: "I tell you, it was very bad physical expression.
Perhaps not, but it was a bad speech I saw".
Continuing to defend the nominated and future Supreme Court chief, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats would use the charges to their own advantage.
"They are determined to restore their strength as much as possible.
He sees evil, cruelty, indifference to those who can hurt, whom he can manipulate to gain power and control".
Elite League: Dundee Stars defeated Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars changed their face on Friday in the Elite League when they faced the Belfast Giants in a 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two early goals against Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the receiving team to a tie before Dwyer reinstated the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the goal in a draw with Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals cemented their win.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe, who won the match 2-1 over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth straight season the two teams met, with the Giants winning their first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in a good 3:35 with Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford passing the ball to Beauvillier and scoring the second goal a few minutes later.
In what seemed like a strong start to the game, Sullivan returned the team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt handed the ball to Cownie and won the match at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' first-round lead with a second-round field goal that evening near the end of the first half.
The host team again tied and Bouchard again scored the goal in the 2737 minute tie.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first game of the season just before the second half and he managed to win the game in the final minutes.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will visit Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died to ensure that hundreds of people on board could survive the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller would be considered a hero after his death to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers crashed to the ground.
More than 800 people were killed and many others were reported missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The last major earthquake continued to hit the area and crowds began to gather from the ruins of buildings in the city of Palu.
But despite the life-saving efforts of his teammates, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to resign from his position in the tower, which was to become extremely shaky due to the wind-driven flight that was hit by the blast at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued his work to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which had reached the point of fire, could fly safely.
Finally, he jumped from the control tower, thinking that it was about to fall.
He died in a hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Authority, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We arranged a convoy from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died in this small storm before it reached Palos.
He added: "We are very sorry to hear about this".
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands as the National Disaster Management Agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is still unfinished.
Institute spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "The number is still rising from many bodies to cover the remains of many others".
The eruption of the volcanoes, which reached a height of six metres, damaged Palu and is expected to be buried in a public cemetery on Sunday.
Military cargo aircraft are bringing supplies and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute comes a rescue with bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Small shops were looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross relief agency in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross relief agency is looking for ways to help survivors but we don't know what they will find.
"It's already dangerous, but it can be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the army: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete every rescue mission.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Airline accident in Micronesia: Now, Air Niugini reports that one person has been reported missing after falling into a coma
The airline that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia is now reporting a man missing after all 47 passengers and crew were previously reportedly removed from the safe location of the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini announced in a statement that it was unable to identify the male partner on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with the Central Administration, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request to provide additional information about the partner as to his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk International Airport.
Seven people were taken to hospital on Friday, officials said.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all were in good health.
The cause of the accident is a misunderstanding.
The airline and the US Navy were informed that the plane crashed into the bay shortly after takeoff.
Some witnesses believe that the plane did not look well at the road.
American friend Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"That is a wonderful thing", Jayness said.
Jaynes said that he and others who managed to get through the water were successful enough to get out of the sinking plane in a hurry.
He said the flight crew were terrified and shouted and he suffered minor head injuries.
The US Navy says that the nearby sailors built a port-like rescue operation using a shuttle to get people ashore before the plane crashes nearly 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people may have died in a plane crash at an airline listed in PNG over the past twenty years but no one had fallen from an Air Niugini aircraft.
An investigator revealed the time of night when a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors have already filed their complaint on Saturday in retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
On Wednesday, US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett gave an hour-long testimony as an expert witness in the criminal investigation.
He showed the board how he used a cell phone to go and collect information about various trips made by the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old murderer, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said she received local information from various phone calls indicating that Tellis was sleeping with Chambers on the night of his death, contrary to what she had previously said, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When reports showed that his cell phone was on the Chambers's side when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford went to the witnessing area on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was being truthful when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "lying, because his car was in Nashville".
Other conflicting reports include that Tellis claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks after his death.
A cell phone record showed that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis left Chambers' text messages, phone calls and his father's address on his phone.
"He's taken her out of his life", Hale said.
The defendant is scheduled to issue his verdict on Sunday.
The judge said the verdict was expected to be delivered to the court in the early hours of the same day.
The High Breed: Hip hop band, you know?
A trio of hip hop artists who want to combat negative stereotypes about the genre put a constructive message in their songs.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed argues that hip hop has shifted to its original direction without providing political messages and social solutions.
They wanted to go back to the market and create a smart, popular hip hop style.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have been revived in the UK through acts such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other one is black?!
A NY foster mother raised her boyfriend to fire her after giving a "call" message
A New York foster mother is accusing her lovers of discriminating against her after she was fired for receiving a false message from another parent who complained that she was "another black".
The couple denies any involvement, calling the charge "robbery".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was deeply disappointed to learn that their new baby, Giselle Maurice, was a black person after arriving at work on the first day of 2016.
"NOAAAAAAAAA AND THE WORK", Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short message.
Instead of sending it to the husband, however, he sent it to Madame Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "felt uncomfortable" and fired Madamazela Maurice, saying that the adoptive, African-American, had done a bad job and expected to meet a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Madamazela Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home in an Uber taxi.
Maurice is now suing his lovers for a bribe for firing him and seeking a $350 daily bribe for six months, despite having been offered a job he had to do without a contract.
"I wanted to show you that this is not the way things are done", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The lovers responded to the accusations of racial discrimination, saying that the expulsion of Maurice was the right thing to do, fearing that he would not be able to believe her after she spoke to him in a rude manner.
"My wife sent me something that I shouldn't have said.
He doesn't do stars.
We are not star makers", Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you give your children to someone who speaks badly of them, even though they are wrong?
Is your baby coming to life?
It is impossible".
Linking the accusation to "robbery", Plasco said his wife was two months pregnant and was "in very serious trouble".
"Can you find a way to pursue such a person?
It's not always the right thing to do", said the investment manager.
As the trial continued, a public verdict quickly rejected the courts, relying on their behavior and their thinking.
Paddington's publishers fear that readers may not be able to adapt to the novel, the new letter suggests.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was approved, wrote in a letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone else reading it for the first time before it's published.
It is so exciting to know how much we now know about Paddington from his accomplishments".
He said his father, who worked for the BBC as a cameraman before he came up with the idea of writing a children's book including a short paperback, would be a bad thing for his work, adding that the 60th anniversary celebrations of the literary festival "were a mixture of joy and sorrow" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, describing him as"the most important member of our family", added that his father was incredibly proud of his achievements.
"He was a very calm man and not a proud man".
"But because Paddington was honest, it was like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of yourself even if it's not really you.
I think he saw Paddington's accomplishments in this way.
Although he had invented it and thought of it, he always gave Paddington himself credit".
My daughter was dying and I had to make a phone call to her.
Immediately after her release, her daughter was rushed to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried their best to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouseati: "Nad was always on the phone to say that things were bad and that he was not expected to recover".
"Now Nad calls me to tell me that she's going to die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye.
And I did just that.
I said: "Tashi, I love you very much, my friend.
We will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
Doctors sometimes prescribe medication to keep her heart rate low until she is out of the body.
He died prematurely and his body was not functioning.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was going to happen.
I could not shout or shout or cry because I was in trouble surrounded by families and people.
I had to be patient".
Then, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, who boarded the plane with the other passengers, forgot the problems she was going through.
"No one knows, " he replied.
"I was shaking my head and crying.
It is difficult to explain, but it was because of the plane that I felt deeply involved in Nad's grief.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Sad women displayed maps to prevent themselves from falling over the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide would work to prevent others from having their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted maps on Welsh landing with a message change and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Ms. Davis' 13-year-old son Tyler, who suffered from depression, committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a confident chef who smiled so much that he attracted a lot of people.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile was the room".
However, before his death, he quit his job, "in darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, learned that his older brother had committed suicide.
"I'm still worried it could affect her", Ms. Davis said.
Mrs. Davis wrote the cards, "to let people know that there are people to go to and talk to, even if they are friends.
Don't sit back and buy, you need someone to talk to".
Mrs. Humphreys, who was a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost her 15-year-old lover, Mark, a few days after losing her mother.
"He never felt overwhelmed or overwhelmed", she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He was in a bad mood for Christmas; when the children were eating their presents, he never looked at them in the face or did anything else".
He said that his death caused them great distress, but they must find a way through it: "There is a huge gap in the family.
You are upset.
But we all have to keep going and get on with the fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I think, if we can get something like what we requested, the investigation has a certain amount of time, a certain amount of time; it could bring us closer together", said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "split up" if there were disagreements among its members.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to shut down?
Their delay is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 if, as expected, the Republicans mismanage it, when they will be very frustrated in trying to get their candidate elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush received phone calls from the senator asking him to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the US President's Office for Mr. Bush and was responsible for meeting his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's special secretary.
What will happen after the FBI begins its report?
There will be elections in the Senate, consisting of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could win at least 50 Senate votes, leaving Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States, with the remaining vote to nominate him as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers "reduced" under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, who said the data provided by the Korean Union Ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border control between North Korea and China is a high-cost for known fugitives who cross illegally.
Pyongyang has never made a public announcement.
Many of the North Korean refugees are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has a larger border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and they are often forcibly returned to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on the possible elimination of nuclear weapons.
It came after a June meeting of the parliamentary assembly of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to a broad working group to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions because no action has been taken since.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ri said: "There is no hope for the United States that there will be confidence in the security of our countries and if so there is no way we can as a country stop developing nuclear weapons first".
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh an "emotional slave", saying he should not be a Supreme Court justice
The incumbent Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, a "servant of conscience" and said he was morally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can only wonder if a woman has ever acted in this way, saying she was 'emotionally depressed,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
In her opening remarks, Kavanaugh was emotionally mensh, as she reached the point of screaming and being bitter when she spoke about her family and her high school years.
He publicly denounced the Democrats on the committee, saying that the allegations of "special and deliberate disgrace" were made by protesters angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was not serving as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was an anti-democrat.
"I think he has taken his own life because of his words and the way he has attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was questioned whether she could try to persuade Kavanaugh when he was confirmed and whether Democrats would gain a majority in the House.
Pelosi said, "I want to tell you that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he shouldn't be working for the Supreme Court, but he should be working for the court he's in right now".
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she was concerned that Kavanaugh might bring a lawsuit against the Equal Treatment Act in Roe v. Wade, which is considered a conservative justice case.
In the case of his conviction, Kavanaugh sidestepped the question of whether he could overturn some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said: "This is no time to be a sentimental slave, someone who has a legal standing and expects us to say, 'This is not right.'"
And women should use it as a weapon.
It is a matter of speaking to people in a proper way, of months and years of being angry and why he cannot speak without tears.
"We cry when we have a meal", was the words of Madamazela Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, does he?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman in charge somewhere who said she had studied when she was angry, but she was looking for a technique that worked so well that when she got up and started crying, she would tell someone to talk to", You might think I was upset because I was crying.
I am angry".
Because he continues.
I think that's a good idea, too".
Tears are natural causes of anger because they are often misheard.
One of the most memorable moments of my early career in a male-only office, where I found myself crying in an unexplained rage, was when I was grabbed by a handsome, seemingly adult, who was a leader who seemed to be so overwhelmed, and then went into a corner.
"Never let them see you cry", he said.
"They don't know you're drunk.
They think you're unhappy and they're happy because they listened to you".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democrat from Colorado, joined Gary Hart in his campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having sex with a non-white woman on the Monkey Business and quickly left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, furious, learned that there was no reason to abandon the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision", he said with a laugh after 30 years.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and another candidate who was not interested at all was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was delayed, he was behind in fundraising efforts and decided not to run unless he had raised $2 million.
It was a battle that could not be won.
He learned that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to men who could only give him $250.
"Do they think I'm being bought?" he asked.
When he made his speech announcing his inability to run for public office, he was overwhelmed by emotions, appreciating his supporters, and resentful of the leadership style that made it harder for him to raise money and reach out to candidates than to representatives with the anger of class discrimination, and became angry.
"You thought I might be depressed", Mrs. Schroeder recalled in a statement to her.
"You obviously thought Kleenex was a joint stock company.
Do I remember, when I contemplate it, that they would write on my grave?
"She cried"?""
How can US-China trade be a good thing for Beijing
The two-way trade war between the US and China had been a major public outcry and if the war comes to an end, the lack of consensus between the two countries could be of long-term benefit to Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, introduced the first tariff bill earlier this year imposing high tariffs on Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant agreement was this week's adoption of new tariffs that would change the value of US$200 billion (£150 billion) including imports, resulting in the taxation of nearly half of all US imports from China.
Beijing responded in a similar fashion, recently imposing a tax rate of five to ten percent on goods worth US$60 billion.
China is committed to aligning the US's efforts, and it is the world's second largest economy and most likely to fail.
Repeating the Washington government means that it can demand something, but publicly bowing to the United States may be a very embarrassing thing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
And experts still argue that if Beijing responds well, the pressure of a US-China trade war could help China reduce its long-term trade deficit with the two major economies.
"Any immediate political decision by either Washington or Beijing could set a directional direction for both countries that would be as bad for the war's observers as they had previously agreed", said Abigail Grace, associate Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security, which has a team of experts.
Syria is "ready" to accept incoming refugees according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of the willing refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by the war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the European Union, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that life in the country is improving.
"Today, the country is in a state of peace and security because of the action taken against terrorism".
The government continues to resettle parts of the area that had been destroyed by the pirates in order to restore normal life.
All directives are available for refugees who wish to voluntarily return to their country of origin due to the threat of terrorism and economic policies that are detrimental to their lives and daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian government is welcoming everyone in rebuilding a war-torn country.
But he stressed that he could not accept the assistance of the dictatorship of countries that encouraged independence.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team in the final by 16.5 points to 10.5 points at the Le Golf National tournament held outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight European Championships and has not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the captain of the Danish team, led by Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American athlete Phil Mickelson, who was severely injured in the competition, threw his ball into the water on lap 3 of 16, losing his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won the overall tournament, becoming the first player in 4 years to score more than 5-0-0 since the current tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by European team founder Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson won 2-1 against Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last Ryder Cup game.
A former Ryder Cup player, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most European-winning player with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually like to cry, but today I don't feel anything.
It was a big year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for his trust and trust in me.
I am so happy, so happy to have returned the cup.
For the team and I'm happy that I was able to help", Garcia said with a lot of emotion after winning the European Championships.
He was appointed by fellow national player John Ram who won the American Golf Championship, Tiger Woods, 2 sets to 1 in a single-player match on Sunday.
"The unmatched pride of winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost the last four games in France and is currently 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup play.
The amazing statistic is that one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team was drawn throughout the weekend to find a proper tie with Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf in all competitions.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a game that was not a success for his team, "I am proud of the players, who fought their best.
This morning, we sometimes put pressure on the European team.
We were divided.
We are very grateful to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We'll come together as a team again, I'll try my best to get to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Competition Committee and we'll get there.
I love the 12 players and am proud to be their captain.
You must consult your captain.
We were more active".
